REPORT OF THE 
 Health Officer.
To THE BoarpD oF HEALTH OF THE CITY OF HOLYOKE, Mass.
Gentlemen Following are the reports of the employees
of the Health Department

GENERAL HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITION OF
THE CITY 
The marked diminution in the number of cases of con 
tagious diseases and deaths therefrom reported during the
year and the absence of threatened epidemic of any
character is very gratifying to the department, affording as it
does very good indication of the health of the people and
the sanitary condition of the eity.
Notwithstanding these very satisfactory conditions this
Board would urge your consideration of recommendation
made to former City Council so that as soon as the financial
condition of the city will warrant, some definite action may be
taken thereon.
. An arrangement of some character to be made that would
provide for the elimination of neighborhood dumps and permit of cleaning up of the unsanitary conditions surrounding
them.
SANITARY INSPECTIONS
The report of the Sanitary Inspectors offers concrete evidence of the work of this branch of the health service. Many

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH 
new duties have been assigned to the force, and the scope of .
, their work has been extended as far as the force and funds
available will permit. ,
MILK AND FOOD INSPECTIONS
Milk and food inspections during the year have shown
good results. Many stores, bakeries and ice cream parlors
were inspected and required to make improvements. The
amount of food stuffs condemned and destroyed was sufficient
‘to convince dealers, ‘‘so inelined,’’ that foods unfit for human
consumption eannot be sold or offered for sale in this city.
The departinent is making an earnest effort to comply
with the requirements of Chapter of the Acts of ,
which provides for the inspection of all out of town dairies
whose owners desire to sell milk in the city of Holyoke.
TUBERCULOSIS HOSPITAL
During the year the Sanatorium provided days’
board for patients, this being daily average of persons.
Of these number were out of town patients, for whose care
the city is reimbursed by the State or the city or town from
which the patient comes.
The actual ripts therefrom during amounted to
$. .
 CONTAGIOUS HOSPITAL
This institution continues doing its excellent work. With
additions it should be adequate for the city’s wants for a
number of years tocome. With the coming summer the gradings of the grounds should be completed, that thorough and
adequate drainage may be provided this year. Appropriations should be sufficient to permit the same to be completed.

 REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH
VITAL STATISTICS

deaths occurred in the city, giving death rate of per

DISEASES DANGEROUS TO PUBLIC HEALTH

REPORT OF THE
Sanitary inspector.
“Dee, .
To THE BoarD OF HEALTH
Gentlemen I hereby submit for your consideration some
of the work that I have done in the past year.
INSPECTION OF TENEMENTS
During the months of Dmber, January, February and
March, excepting to care for complaints that came to me for
inspection, all my time was taken up. inspecting tenements,
and I have on file in the office of the Board of Health special
inspection eards filed by wards and streets. I can now inform
your Board that during the past five years, during the winter
months, this work has been done by me, that recorded survey of all the tenement property in the city excepting Elmwood, Oakdale and the Ilighlands has been completed.
INSPECTING AND ABATING NUISANCES
During the year I have inspected two hundred and sixty
 complaints and several of them I found to constitute
dangerous nuisances, others were of the kind that make life
and habitation unpleasant. The complaints that were a
menace to health were immediately abated, regardless of cost,
the others were cared for by more deliberate process,
INSPECTION OF ALLEYS AND YARDS
 The Board of Health especially assigned to me the task
of trying to improve the appearance of the alleys, yards and

 REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH
vacant lots of the rubbish and papers that too often is thrown
into and scattered around them and from the alleys and yards
eventually reaching our streets and sidewalks, which causes
them to appear neglected and dirty. In trying to improve
permanently these conditions I have ordered the removal of
all ash boxes from the alleys. Also ordered owners of buildings to put and keep their ash chutes in such condition, that
the refuse that is put in said chutes by tenants will remain
intact until removed by the proper collectors. This can only
be done by keeping all ash chute doors locked.
INSPECTING GARBAGE RECEPTACLES AND GARBAGE COLLECTORS
This work has also been assigned to me by the Board of
Health and notwithstanding that through some arrangement
existing for years this work is supervised and contracted for
by the Board of Public Works, it is absolutely Board of
Health work and through me the Board constantly tries to
eare for the health of the thousands of men, women and children who live in our thousands of tenement blocks in this city
and who are constantly exposed to the many and dangerous
nuisances that must be watched and abated. I have cared
for many such cases during the last year.
The Board of Health requested all the garbage contractors to file with them hst of the names of all men working for them, and only two of the contractors that have lved contracts from the Board of Public Works to collect
garbage have complied with the requests of the Board of
 Health by sending in the names of the employees and subeontractors. The facts are, that under existing conditions
when the scores of complaints that come to the Board of
ITealth office about uncollected garbage and are referred to
me, I mspect conditions and must then refer them to the
Board of Public Works, causing delay that at times is dangerREPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH 
ous to many persons, instead of settling direct and effectively
with each case as soon as reported.

CO OPERATION NEEDED, TO BE EFFECTIVE

Through experience I positively state that more effective
and permanent results would be attained if the efforts of the
Board of Health were more thoroughly assisted by the Police
Department in enforeing the City Ordinances and our city
streets and alleys would not only appear better but the citizens would appreciate the needed improvements.

In conclusion I desire to thank the members of the department for their courtesy and co operation.

 Respectfully submitted,
 Signed DANIEL D. MAHONEY, 
Sanitary Inspector.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH 
The usual number of complaints have been investigated
and nuisances abated where found, on verbal notice from the
inspector and no record has been kept of same.
The department notes slight increase in the amount of 
building for the year and conditions would indicate busy
seacon for ,
Several violations of the plumbing ordinance have been
reported to the Board during the past twelve months and one
court case is still pending.
While the duties of the Plumbing Inspector as prescribed
by the Revised Laws of Massachusetts are to inspect all
plumbing for which permits are granted, ete., there seems to
be at present disposition on the part of the plumbers to assist in the compliance of the state laws. This is particularly 
gratifying to the department and the Inspector will give all
possible assistance, personally and officially, in the prosecution
of all violations of the Plumbing Laws.
In conclusion I desire to thank the members of the Board
and the employees of the department for their courtesy and
co operation.
Respectfully submitted,
