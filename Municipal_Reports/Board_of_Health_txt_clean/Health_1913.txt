REPORT OF THE
To His Honor, the Mayor, and Board of Aldermen of the
City of Holyoke, Mass. 

Gntlemen The thirty third annual statement of all matters pertaining to the Board of Health for the year ending
Nov. is hereby submitted for your consideration. 

ORGANIZATION.

The members of the Board of Health met for organization
the first Monday of February, and elected the following officers Maurice Lynch, Chairman J. Sidney Wright,
Vice Chairman J. Joseph Carroll, M. D., Secretary and
Bacteriologist. 

Appended are the reports of the Health Officer, Inspector
of Plumbing, Inspector of Milk, Inspector of Meat and
Provisions, Bacteriologist, and Superintendent of the Sanatorium also the mortality tables and records of the registration of contagious diseases with record of the office
work and statement of the ripts and expenditures.

Regular meetings of the Board have been held each month 
and special meetings when nssary.

DISEASES DANGEROUS TO PUBLIC HEALTH.

Diphtheria cases are required to be isolated for minimum period of fourteen days, scarlet fever for twenty one
days and measles for ten days. Small pox cases are turned
over to the Health Department as soon as the diagnosis s
made. Chicken pox, mumps and whooping cough cases are
kept from school but isolation is not as strictly enforced.

No children from placarded houses are allowed to attend
school until the termination of the case.

 REPORT OF THE BUJARD OF HEALTH

Isolation maintained largely by allowing wage earners
to continue their voeations if all rules are obeyed and the
arrangement of the house permits perfect isolation. Among
families Where isolation is impossible, wage earners are in
some eases allowed to continue work if they can stay away
from home.

ANTI TOXIN. No red tape is nssary to secure free anti toxin. It is
given at once upon the request of any physician, and in any
quantity. A swab is required whenever anti toxin given.

VACCINATION

It is generally admitted that vaccination and re vaceination furnish the only real protection against small pox.
Quarantine and isolation alone will not control the disease. SMALL POX.

During the year five cases of small pox were discovered,
one on Hampden street, one on Park street, and three on
Main street. The latter cases were in boarding house and
the three inmates who developed the disease were removed
to Hillside Hospital.

 The souree of this was small child being brought here
from Canada where there was an epidemic of small pox.

The total cost of the five cases was $.part of which
will be returned to the city.

DISINFECTION. ,

Disinfection is done after the termination of diphtheria,

scarlet fever, small pox and tubercular eases.
TUBERCULOSIS.

Many eases of this disease are not reported, though every
effort is made to secure complete registration. In addition
to registration, the Health Department examines sputum
from which eases are reported and disinfeets after death 
removal of case.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH 
CONTAGIOUS DISEASE HOSPITAL.

The status of the question of contagious disease hospital
for the city remains the same as last year the arguments
for it are the same. While nothing definite has been done as
yet toward the establishment of contagious disease hospital, still the recommendation of His Honor the Mayor and
the requests of the State Board of Health would seem to
inake certain the erection of such structure in short time.

INFANT MORTALITY.

Infant mortality, perhaps, more than any one topie, should
rive our most careful attention. The eity or town which
at the present day is not alive to the possibilities of saving
human life through taking heed of its milk supply, its training and care, through judicious, kindly advice and assistanee from competent nurse, to the mothers who either 
through ignorance or careless indifference negleet the young
child, is coming far short of its privileges and also its duty.

It is gratifying and encouraging to be able to state that
this line of health work is riving much attention and
consideration throughout the country.

The difference in the death rate of the various social
classes is noticeably marked in the case of infants, and the
most foreeful argument favoring the district nurse for
those mothers who either do not know or are unable to give
proper care and attention to their babies for one cause or
another is, that mortality the first year of life differs enormously, according to the circumstances of the parents and
the amount of intelligent care bestowed upon the infant.

VITAL STATISTICS.

During the year, deaths occurred in tne city, giving
a death rate of per cent per thousand population, exeluding the non residents Our actual death rate s
 per thousand.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH 

The department notes decided decrease of plumbing
plans as per previous years, which can be attributed to a
less number of new buildings erected and less alterations
and additions on old property.

The rnt codification of the city ordinances affects
plumbing materjally and as soon as same can be printed
and served upon the plumbers the present dissatisfaction .
will be eliminated and the department and publie will again
have thorough understanding and confidence.

A few cases of failure to fully comply to the ordinance
are in the hands of the Board and will be brought up for
consideration in the near future.

In conclusion I desire to thank the members of the Board

Report of the Bacteriologist.
To the Honorable, the Board of Health 

Gentlemen I herewith submit my report on specimens
submitted to me for laboratory examination during the year
ending Nov. .

DIPHTHERIA. 

During the year there were swabs subinitted for diagnosis. Of these were positive and negative. There
Were eleven release swabs examimed in cases that had been
reported to your Board but in which no diagnosis swab had
been taken.

November showed the largest number of positive diagnoses for any one month whereas June was the lightest
month, we having examined during that month but one positive swab for diagnosis.

TUBERCULOSIS.

Each year shows an increase in the number of sputum exaiminations. This is due in part to the fact that your Board
requires positive sputum before admitting patient to
the Sanatorium and in part to the faet that physicians realize more and more as each year passes, the value of laboratory examinations of sputum in doubtful cases. This is
demonstrated by the fact that out of total of specimens but or per cent, were positive.

 TYPHOID FEVER.

There were specimens of blood submitted for Widal
tests during the year, of which three were positive and nine
negative.

 REPORT OF THE BUARD OF HEALTH
OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUEM.

I would again suggest that your Board msist that smear
be taken from every discharging eye of the new born.

I would further suggest that the Board appoint some physician to take the final release swab in all eases of diphtheria
as In this Way we are more apt to obtam satisfactory results. 

In conelusion allow me to thank the members of the Board
and its attaches for the courteous treatment and co operation
accorded me during the year.

Appended you will find tabulated report of all examinations made in the laboratory durmg the year.

Very respectfully,
J.J. CARROLL, M. D.,
Bacteriologist.
