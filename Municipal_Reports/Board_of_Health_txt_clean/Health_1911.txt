REPORT OF THE
To His Honor, the Mayor, and Gentlemen of the Board
of Aldermen

Gentlemen In compliance with the public statutes, the
Board of Health herewith respectfully submit for your consideration the thirtyfirst annual report for the year ending
November .

 ORGANIZATION.

The members of the Board of Health met for organization the first Monday in February, and elected the following officers Arthur B. Wetherell, M. D., Chairman J.
Sidney Wright, Secretary J. Joseph Carroll, M. D., Bacteriologist.

In reviewing the work of the year, it evident that the
work of the employees has been improved in scope and character and the Board placed on better working basis than
ever before. This is exactly what should oceur each sucding year, for the public health ought to be the first consideration in any community.

MORTALITY.

The death rate for the year, excluding non residents,
was per cent per thousand, and ineluding non residents,
 per cent. This is the lowest death rate, excepting one
year, since It is very gratifying to note the decrease
for the year in the number of deaths from contagious and
infectious diseases.


 REPORT OF BUARD OF HEALTH
TUBERCULOSIS.

The death rate from tuberculosis during the past year
was per cent. Regarding tuberculosis, we have been
more active during the past year than ever before in our
attempt to prevent the spread of this disease and we are now
fumigating and disinfecting many homes where tubercular
cases are found. As this is not only preventable but a
curable disease, we hope that with the widespread interest
now manifested among our people in the causes and eonditions leading up to tuberculosis and its eare and treatment,
that our efferts will result in steady decrease in the
death rate from this disease in this city.

We desire to thank his honor, the Mavor, and all others
who in any way have assisted in the erection and furnishing
of the new hospital and we feel sure it will ‘be great benefit
to our city In the care and treatment of this disease.

TYPHOID FEVER.

There was an Increase in the number of cases reported
of this disease. Every case was carefully and thoroughly
investigated to ascertain if possible the probable souree of
infeetion. A large number of cases were traced to sources
of infection outside of the city and these were without doubt 
imported and some of them were undoubtedly due to direct
contact with other cases. In many eases, however, it was
impossible to definitely trace the source of the typhoid infection as the patients had not been outside of the city for
many weeks and thorough investigation of the milk supply,
water supply and every other usual source of infection
failed to show any common carrier.

CONTAGIOUS DISEASES.

One of the most important and difficult branches of the
work of this Board is to successfully meet the conditions
that are constantly before us in the management of contaREPORT UF BOARD OF HEALTH 
gious diseases. We feel that the quarantine measures now
being imposed upon households afflicted with scarlet fever
and diphtheria are as strict as we can possibly make them
under present conditions and are often very trying and nssittae great financial loss to the family.

We have repeatedly found it impossible tn some families to isolate the ease and protect the rest of the family.
We are confident that the establishment by he city of a
hospital for the isolation and treatment of all contagious
diseases would annually save many little lives, be blessing
to many families who ean ill afford any financial loss whatever and aid the Board in carrying out the strict quarantine
measures that modern preventive methods demand.

SCARLET FEVER.

The number of cases of this disease is about the same
as last year. It is only fair to presume that the rigid quarantine measures established by the Board and the thorough
fumigation in every case have had much to do with this
disease.

DIPHTHERIA.

There was marked decrease in the number of cases of
diphtheria reported last year, but we regret nevertheless
that our death rate from this disease is higher than it should
be when we are confident that we have in the anti toxin
reatment positive cure if the case is diagnosed early and
the treatment instituted, especially as free anti toxin ean
be so easily procured in this city.

MILK.

The report of the Milk Inspector shows that he has
been active in his efforts to secure for the people of this city
a clean milk supply. This food product, so essential to
ehildren, is being carefully watched. A perfect supply,

 REPORT UF BOARD OF HEALTH
however, can only be secured through the education and cooperation of all who handle milk. We regret that the constuner frequently neglects to take care of the milk after it
is delivered to his home, thereby defeating all our efforts to
secure clean milk for his consumption.

SANITARY INSPECTION.

To keep the city in sanitary oendition it is nevessary
for the sanitary inspectors to make frequent inspections of
all the vards and outhouses in the city and issue many orders
to householders to clean their premises. During the vear all
the bakeries, barber shops and slaughter houses have been
inspected. All applications for barns have rived careful
attention.

. PLUMBING.

The report of the Plumbing Inspector shows the large
amount of work accomplished in this important branch of
munieipal sanitation. With the growth of the eity there
has been an inevease in the number and value of the building
operations and corresponding inerease in the work of the
Inspectors. The continued activity of the Board in compelling all property owners in sewered districts to connect
with the sewer, the constantly inereasing construetion of
sewers in unsewered districts, the remodeling of the plumbing svstems of old buildings and other ssary work has
so Increased, that there is very little time left for other work.

Report of Bacteriologist
To the Holyoke Board of Health

Gentlemen I herewith submit my report on cases referred to me for laboratory examination during the year ending Noy. .

DIPHTHERIA. ,

We have been unusually free from cases of diphtheria
this vear. The total positive cultures numbered but ,
Which is the lowest it has been for number of years past.
That the physicians are daily realizing more and more the
importance of nricroscopreal examination and the nssity
of taking swab in all suspicious cases is demonstrated by
the fact that although the positive eultures numbered but
we had which were negative.

TUBERCULOSIS.

This branch of our work is growing rapidly as is shown
by the fact that speciments of sputum were examined
this vear as against three vears ago, at which time the loeal laboratory was opened.

Onee again I wish to emphasize the fact that in eases
that are clinically suspicious single negative examination
should never be accepted as conclusive evidence that the
patient is not victim of tuberculosis, because at times the
bacilli are found after several negative eaxminations.

TYPHOID FEVER.

The mumber of ‘blood specimens submitted for Widal
examinations is small in proportion to the number of eases
reported as typhoid fever.

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH t

It is to be regreted that all cases reported as typhoid
do not have specimens sent in for examination.

OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM.

I would again suggest that the physicians be compelled
to take smear in cases where there is discharge from
the eves of the new born. Should this Board pass upon
this matter favorably, I will gladly furnish outfits and if we
sucd in saving but one pair of eyes year, we will be
amply repaid for the trouble and expense involved.

Respectfully submitted,
J.J. CARROLL, M. D.,
Bacteriologist.
