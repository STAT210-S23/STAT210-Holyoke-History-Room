REPORT OF THE
BOARD OF HEALTH
To His Honor, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen of the
City of Holvoke, Mass. 

GENTLEMEN The thirty fifth annual statement of all
. matters pertaining to the Board of Health for the year ending November is hereby submitted for your consideration.

ORGANIZATION. 

The members of the Board of Health met for organization the first Monday of February, and elected the following officers J. Sidney Wright, Chairman William J.
Powers, M. D., Secretary. April J. Sidney Wright resigned as member of the Board and John J. Burke was appointed. Frank A. Woods, M. D., was elected Chairman.

Appended are the reports of the Health Officer, Inspector of Plumbing, Inspector of Milk, Inspector of Meat and
Slaughtering, Bacteriologist and Sanatorium for Tubereulosis.

Regular weekly meetings of the Board have been held
and special meetings as oceasion required during the year.

GENERAL HEALTH.

It has been well said that with well organized Health
Department community may have as much health as it is
willing to pay for.

A low death rate is one of the best indications of the
general health conditions of the community. During the past
year our death rate is slightly higher than that of .
This is due in part at least to the fact that number of out 
of town patients are brought to our local hospitals, many
have died within short time after admission. To charge

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH 
these deaths to city and in consequence increase their death
rate has always appeared unfair. Were they not so charged
our death rate would have been much lower.

Life and happiness depend wholly upon good health.
This being purchasable, the responsibility of its purchase and
the health of community is placed squarely upon the snoulders of those charged with making the appropriation for
health work. No attempt should be made to compute in dollars and cents the value of human life.

In conelusion the Board of Health wishes at this time
to express its appreciation for the convenient rooms which
we now occupy in the City Hall Annex, and thank the Honorable Mayor and Board of Aldermen for all assistanee and
courtesies extended during the year, and to the heads of departments and all other employees the Board is indebted
for their efficient efforts in the service that the health and
comfort of the community might be safeguarded.

Respectfully submitted,
FRANK A. WOODS, MI. D.,
WILLIAM J. POWERS, M. D.,
PATRICK E. HURLEY, M. D.,
. Board of Health.

 

Report of the Health Officer

 GENTLEMEN I respectfully submit the following de 

tailed report of the Board carried on under the direction of ,
its Health Officer for the year ending November .

Besides the routine work of the office which has been 
carried on as usual, the reports of the Plumbing, Milk, Sanitary and Inspectors of Markets and Provisions are annexed.

The department has been exdingly fortunate in having subordinate employees who were loyal and who yave
willing and enthusiastic service at all times. Without this
the Health Department could not have become what it is today, the most active and vigorous city department.

As in the past much time and attention has been given 
to the sanitary arrangements and methods in the making
and exposure for sale of all foodstuffs. There is room, how 
ever, for improvement in this respect.

DISINFECTION.

Disinfection is done after diphtheria, scarlet fever, smallpox and tuberculosis cases. The question of its efficiency or
utility has been considered, but it may be continued for no
other reason than because it easier to convince the householder of the nssity for general cleaning of woodwork,
floor and furniture if fumigation is done by the Health Department. 
Number of mattresses destroyed 
Number of dead animals removed 

 Number of bakeries inspected 
Number of barber shops inspected 
Number of cases posted ee 
Number of rooms fumigated after diphtheria and scarlet
fever wc esser 

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH 

' Number of rooms fumigated after cancer 
Number of rooms fumigated after tuberculosis, deaths

 and removals ces 

Number of school permits issued 

Number of school rooms fumigated 

I earnestly recommend that immediate steps should be
taken to provide adequate hospital accommodations for scarlet fever and diphtheria on the Cherry street property owned
by the city, now, when there is plenty of room in an excellent
location and where all contagious diseases under the Board
of Health by law could be concentrated.

Increase in the size of the Tuberculosis Hospital is absolutely nssary in the immediate future. In my opinion
there should be house erected for the nurses and help. If
this was done, it would about double the present capacity for
patients. As it is now and has been for some time overerowded with large number on the waiting list which we
cannot accommodate.

Report of the Sanitary Inspector

 

To the Board of Health 

GENTLEMEN I herewith submit my report for the year 

ending November 

As requested by your Board, during the year special at 
tention was given to the tenement properties owned by the
different manufacturing companies in the city of Holyoke,

and I am pleased to report that regardless of expense each 

 and everyone of said companies complied with your requests 

and made number of improvements which very much 
proved the sanitary condition and added to the comfort of

the tenants. 

I have inspected during the year hundreds of tenements 

from the cellars to the top floors reported to the office of im 
provements, if important, that I recommended to be made, and
also reporting and having improved everything, that in my
opinion, would improve the living conditions, from sanitary viewpoint, of the thousands of men, women and children
who live in the tenement district of our city. There yet re
mains much work to be done, which is very important and
absolutely nssary. However, I know that the work done
by the Board of Health this year in the line of sanitary improvements, as is demanded by the laws of the nation and
state, is very much appreciated, not alone by the poor people,

who live in the congested districts, but by all the thinking 
public who are interested in this humane and important

work which your Board of Health, in common with all other 

kindred Boards and good people are trying to accomplish. 

Respectfully submitted,

DANIEL D. MAHONEY,

Sanitary Inspector.

The department notes slight increase in plumbing
caused by alterations and repairs in old buildings. The
usual number of nuisances have been investigated, and in
most cases have been abated on verbal notice from the inspector.

Three general inspections have been made of saloons and

 REPORT OF THE BOARD OF JIEALTH

the majority have been found to comply to the rules of the
Board of Health. Frequent inspections of few places have
been nssary to keep them up to the standard, and general improvement as regards clean and sanitary conditions
ean be reported. I would recommend the abolishing of
‘‘Free Lunch’’ as served at present, as in the opinion of
many who are qualified to judge, the serving of food under
conditions where it can be handled promiscuously by the
public, where the same forks are used without washing, etce.,
is source of infection, contagion and prejudicial to public
health.

A noted decrease in the inspection of sewers is noted by
reason of the laying of sewers to the building line by the
eity.

In econelusion I desire to thank the members of the department for their courtesy and co operation.

Respectfully submitted,
F. L. AVERY,
Inspector of Plumbing.
