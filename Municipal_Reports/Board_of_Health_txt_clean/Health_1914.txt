REPORT OF THE
To His Honor, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen
of the City of Holyoke, Mass. 

GENTLEMEN The thirty fourth annual statement of all
matters pertaining to the Board of Health for the vear ending November is hereby submitted for your consideration

ORGANIZATION.

The members of the Board of Health met for organization the first Monday of February, and elected the following officers J. Sidney Wright, Chairman Frank A.
Woods, M. D., Seeretary J. Joseph Carroll, M. D., Bacteniologist.

Appended are the reports of the Health Officer, Inspector of Plumbing, Inspector of Milk, Inspector of Meat
and Slaughtering, Bacternologist and Sanatorium for Tubereulosis.

Regular meetings of the Board have been held and special meetings as occasion required,

SCHOOL INSPECTION.

Eternal vigilanee on the part of the school physicians in
the early detection of symptoms of communicable diseases
and prompt exclusion from school of such eases will be an
important factor in the effort to stamp out communicable
diseases.

Medical inspection is business proposition, human life
eannot be measured in dollars and cents. This is proposition worthy of the careful consideration of our City Government and the parents of Holyoke.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH 

We desire to repeat the warnings given year ago concerning the practice of removing children from houses about
to be placarded. During the year several cases have come
to our notice where children have taken up temporary resdence with families whose children have continued to attend
school. Unfortunately the parents do not realize that all this
tends to defeat the ends for which we are working in isolating these diseases, that of preventing contagion.

We desire to call the attention of physicians to the fact
that they have not complied with the requirements of the
law when they report cases of contagious diseases by telephone. It is their duty to fill out the cards with the nssary information and immediately forward them to the

Board of Health.
ONLY A COLD.

A common cold or little sore throat in young children
should be viewed seriously. The first symptoms of measles
and whooping cough are generally hard eold. In diphtheria and scarlet fever it is often ‘‘just little sore throat.’’
If vour child has cold or sore throat do not send him to
school. By so doing you are endangering the health and
lives of the other children. It is much better for one child
to lose day or two from school than expose probably hundreds of other children to the danger of infection. marked
improvement is not shown in day or two, send for the doctor.

OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM.

Twenty six eases of ophthalmia neonatorum were reported during the year. The prevention of blindness from
the menace of ophthalmia neonatorum and the preservation
of evesight is one of the most important duties instructed to
the Board of Health. If the case cannot be properly treated
and cared for at home it is sent to hospital or eve infirmary
for treatment.

 REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH
TUBERCULOSIS.

Tuberculosis is not comparable to the aeute infectious
diseases. Its evolution is slow and its spread not very rapid.
The public should be led to believe that it presents problem to meet sensibly, that spitting promiscuously is dangerous and passing of handkerehiefs, glasses or other articles
from the mouth of one person to that of another is not only

. unelean but risky.

It is just as much of nuisance to the public, if not
more so, for the tubercular person to expectorate in the street
as it is for him to spit on the sidewalk or floor.

Kindness to the consumptive should impel us to regard
him, not as pestilence, contact with which surely infects us,
but as one who is unfortunate and one who should be encouraged to learn how he ean improve and how he can avoid
transferring his disease to others. Above all he should not
be made to feel that. because he has tuberculosis he must exert himself no more. He owes duty to the community
fully as much as the community owes one to him.

VITAL STATISTICS.

The total number of death certificates filed during the
vear and the total number of burial permits issued was ,
not including still births.

In connection with the burial of these bodies, loeal permits and transit permits were Issued, bodies
were brought to Holyoke for burial for which transfer permits were Issued.

Based upon the census of the Water Department for
which gives Holyoke population of , the death
rate is .

Deducting the deaths of non residenis in institutions we find true death rate of .

The following tables give the details of the deaths and

 still births for the vear ending November .

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH 
IMPORTANT TO HOUSEHOLDERS.
Keeping Milk Cool.

Milk should be the only food of infants under one year
of age. If the cow, milk and utensils in which milk is rived and kept are clean and the milk is kept cold, below
fiftv degrees Fahrenheit. 

Milk should be brought into the house in clean and
healthful condition. It is one of the most perishable of
foods. If milk is kept in warm room when it is rived in
the home it will rapidly turn into poor food, even before
it becomes sour. Therefore it should be placed on ice immediately upon riving it and kept in the coolest part of the
house.

GARBAGE AND REFUSE.

There are hundreds of premises in the city without any
proper rptacle for ashes and refuse. The city ordinance
requires that they shall be provided. At various times many
premises have been provided with rptacles, but they have
not been suitable for continued use, some being too flimsy
and nearly all of them portable. If such rptacles are
preferred, the expense of replacing the broken and stolen
ones should be expected and provided for.

MILK INSPECTION.

This branch of public health work has been conducted in
substantially the same manner as during the past seven years
and with the same end in view, to secure for this city clean,
fresh and healthful milk supply as well as one that would
not fall below the standards prescribed by law.

ICE CREAM.

In the summer months Inspections were frequently made
of places where ice cream is manufactured and of retail
stores and whenever improvements were deemed nssary
they were carried out.

 REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH
MILK STATIONS.
The name is misnomer for although one of the attractions offered is the supply of milk of known quantity either
free or at nominal cost as conditions warrant, the most effective work is that given in consultations to mothers. There
is no doubt of its tremendous asset in public health work.
INSPECTORS.
We again renew our request for more inspectors that
we may be able to meet the demand for better housing econditions, regular imspeetions of bakeries, restaurants and
other places where food is prepared and sold. This lack of
adequate help prevents our giving these important matters
the attention they deserve.
THE EMPLOYEES.
All the employees have done good, conseientious work.
In spite of the faet that the number of our employees has
not been increased in proportion to the growth of the eity,
and in spite of the consequent inerease of the work, no complaint has been heard on the part of any of the members of 
the staff and the clerks and inspectors have continued their
extra work with their usual willingness and application ta
duty.

There has been more general co operation with the
Meat Inspector in the enforcement of health laws than has
been the ease in previous vears by the dealers engaged in the
business. Markets as rule are clean and sanitary, and foods
offered for sale are more temptingly displayed. The results
obtained are very satisfactory to all concerned.

The city has had the distinction of being exempt from
the “‘Hoof and Mouth Disease,’’ which has been so prevalent
if the cities and towns round about us. A strict quarantine
Was maintained during the epidemic, and extra and unusual
precautions taken to guard our eltizens against the eontagion.

In conelusion I wish to thank the members of the Board
of Health and the emplovees connected with it, for their support and co operation in carrying out the provisions of all
health laws under my jurisdiction,

Report of the Bacteriologist
To the Honorable, the Board of Health

GENTLEMEN I herewith submit my report for the year
ending November 

There has been tremendous inerease in the work done
in the laboratory during the past year, there having been
 examinations made which is far in exeess of the total
number made in any one year im the past.

DIPHTHERIA.

I have examined cultures this year. Of these 
were for diagnosis, were positive and negative. The
balance, &were release cultures.

For several years past your Board has required two consecutive negative release swabs in all cases of diphtheria, and
now as further precaution I would suggest that in the future that two negative swabs should be required from the
nares as well as from the throat. This would serve to give
greater protection against transmission of the disease, because
as vou well know the nares may harbor the organism long
after the throat becomes free. .

I would further suggest that your Board adopt rule to
the effect that the second release swab be taken by physician to be designated by you.

TUBERCULOSIS.

During the year I have examined specimens of
sputum for tubercle bacilli. Of this number were positive and negative. This is higher percentage of positives than is usually the case, and tends to show that the
physicians do not take advantage of the laboratory facilities

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH 
which your Board has placed at their disposal in order to
ald them in the diagnosis of doubtful eases.

TYPHOID.

Nine specimens of blood have been examined for typhoid,

all of which were negative.
OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM.

Five smears taken from discharging eves of infants were
all found to be negative.

Appended you will find tabulated list of the work accomplished during the year.

In conclusion I wish to thank vour Board and its attaches for their courtesy extended to me during the year.
