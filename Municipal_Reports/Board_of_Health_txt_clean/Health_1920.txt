REPORT OF THE
 Health Officer.
To THE Boarp oF HEALTH OF THE CITY OF HOLYOKE, Mass.

Gentlemen I respectfully submit the following detailed
report of the Board of Iealth as carried on under the direction of its Health Officer.

GENERAL JIEALTH.

It has been well said that with well organized Health
Department, community may have as much health as it is
willing to pay for.

A low death rate is one of the best indications of the

 general health conditions of the eommunity. During the past
year our death rate was lower than any year for long time.

Life and happiness depend wholly upon good health.
This being purchasable, the responsibility of its purchase and
the health of community is placed squarely upon the
shoulders of those charged with making the appropriation for
health work. No attempt should be made to compute in dollars and cents the value of human life.

Many complamts of all kinds have been rived and
careful attention has been given to each one and steps taken
to improve eonditions and remove the cause.

The general health of the city is influenced by many
factors and In order to accomplish the best results the work
of the Board of Health must cover many. lines and each year
sees an Increase In the amount of work required of this department, not only mn the prevention of contagious diseases
but in many. other lines bearing upon the safeguarding of the
public health.

REPORT OF BUARD OF HEALTH 
The contagious disease tables and the mortality reeords ,
also show an evidenee of its healthfulness and by comparing
these rates for number of years the information valuable.

REPORT OF THE
Sani it
anitary Inspector.
" THE BoarD oF HEALTH
Gentlemen As Sanitary Inspector I submit report of
the work done during the fiseal year ending November .
INSPECTING AND ABATING NUISANCES.
Forty six official notices have been sent to owners of build ngs where nuisances were found and twice that number were
personally requested to abate minor nuisanees. All was accomplished without resorting to court procedure.

During the year number of complaints were rived
at this office and same were inspected.

Five hundred twenty complaints were rived at this
office, three hundred forty nine of which were for uncollected
garbage, other causes of complaints were for dirty yards,
cellars, leaking roofs, dirty toilets, dirty tenements, keeping
pigs, rabbits, hens and coal gas odors. All these complaints
were inspected and cared for and reports to this office of results were made by me.

‘ INSPECTION OF TENEMENTS.

During the year number of tenements were inspected
to find out under what conditions the people were living. I
find that owing to the scarcity of tenements that everything
with walls and roof on is occupied including dark bed rooms
where no ray of sunshine ever reaches and by far too many
families are occupying such tenements. A yearly inspection
of tenement conditions should be inspected. During this
year I made such inspections,

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH 
INSPECTION OF ALLEYS AND YARDS.

The efforts to improve the conditions in the alleys has
been continued during the year and most of them have been
cleared of ash boxes and other obstructions. The alley between Main and Race Streets from Appleton to Spring
Streets has been paved at the expense of the property owners 
and this is much needed improvement. A number of other
alleys in the business section would also be improved by
paving. 

INSPECTION OF GARBAGE RECEPTACLES AND
COLLECTIONS. ,

I have paid special attention to this important work and
have installed during the year new garbage cans to replace leaking and broken ones and I would recommend that
the rules of both the Board of Health and Board of Public
Works which forbid the mixing of garbage with ashes or other
refuse to be strictly enforced. By so doing thousands of 
tenants will be protected from dangerous nuisance, not only
in the tenement blocks where they are living but also the
thousands who live in the blocks in the vicinity of our public
dumps.

CO OPERATION NEEDED TO BE EFFECTIVE.

Again I positively state, that if the City Ordinances
were more rigidly enforced our streets and alleys would look
at all times much better and no hardships need be imposed,
but honest co operation of the Police Department with the
efforts of the Board is required.

In conclusion I desire to thank all the members of the
Department for their courtesy and co operation.

Respectfully submitted, .
DANIEL D. MAHONEY,
Sanitary Inspector.

The usual number of complaints have been investigated
and nuisances abated where found, on verbal notice from the
inspector and no record has been kept of same.

busy season for 

Several violations of the plumbing ordinance have been
reported to the Board during the past twelve months.

and the employees of the department for their courtesy and
