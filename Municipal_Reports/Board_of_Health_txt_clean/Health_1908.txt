. REPORT OF THE
. é 
BOARD OF HEALTH. 
To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen of the

City of Holyoke ,

GENTLEMEN We have the honor to submit herewith for
your consideration the annual report of the Health Department, including such suggestions and recommendations as are
deemed of interest to the public.

ORGANIZATION.

The Board met February and elected the following officers A. B. Wetherell, M. D., chairman F. A. 
Woods, M. D., secretary. J. J. Carroll, M. D., was elected
bacteriologist March 

PUBLIC HEALTH.

The general health of the city has been good during the
year, there having been no serious epidemics of any kind.
Contagious diseases, while more or less prevalent in different

forms, were kept under ccntrol. As soon as ease of contagious disease reported by physician, the sanitary inspector
immediately establishes quarantine so as to isolate the case
and prevent others from being exposed to the disease.

During the period of quarantine which varies from two
to four weeks according to the length of time disease is con 
tagious, the officer visits all places under quarantine at frequent intervals to see whether anything is needed by those

 REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
in quarantine in the way of food, fuel, ete., and if nssary
the same are furnished by this department.

On the recovery of all those having contagious diseases
or in ease of death therefrom, the house under quarantine is
thoroughly disinfected and the inmates are then released
from quarantine.

There have been numerous requests to have patients suffering from contagious diseases placed in some hospital, but
owing to lack of any such institution the Board has been helpless.

The building of Contagious Disease Hospital will
greatly aid the Board in the prevention of epidemics.

The building of new sewers has also been helpful to the
Board in the abatement of nuisances and the control of diseases.

HOSPITAL FOR CONTAGIOUS DISEASES.

The attention of your Honorable Board is again ealled
to the urgent need of Hospital in our city. It is unnssary in the present state of our knowledge as to the means by

 which contagious diseases are spread to enter into any long
. agrument to prove that removal to hcspital is the most effective measure for controlling them.

As to the plan of the hospital to be constructed, much
will depend upon whether all buildings are to be permanent,
or some to be of cheaper structure and renewed at intervals.

A contagious hospital in Holyoke is nssity the
Board strongly recommends its immediate establishment.

 UNDERTAKERS.

Thirteen licenses have been granted to engage in
this business during the year.

SAUSAGE MANUFACTURERS.

Six licenses have been granted for the manufacture
of sausage and prepared meat.

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH. 
BARBER SHOPS.

There has been two general inspections of the Barber
Shops and with few exceptions, they are in good sanitary
condition. Notices were sent in few cases and the orders.
were complied with.

The various bakeries have had two general inspections as
well as frequent inspections by the Health Officer during the
year. The conditions are the same as in former years.

COLLECTION OF GARBAGE.

, During the year the collection of garbage has been in
the hands of the Department of Public Works. Complaints
for non colleetion have come to this department and have
been in turn given to the department of Public Works. Bitter criticism has been heaped upon the Health Officer by irate
citizens whcse garbage collections had been neglected. The 
publie should understand that if there is cause for criticism
the fault lies with the collector, and that the best we can do
for them is to report their complaints to the department that
has charge of the garbage collection.

MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS.

Medical inspection of the pupils in the schools has been
continued alcng the lines followed since its establishment. Its
usefulness would be much imecreased by more frequent inspections, but for the limited amount of mcney at our dispcsal the results are the best that can be accomplished.

The inspectors’ reports during the year show that about
two hundred and fifty children have been sent home from 
school in need of medical attention, suffering from the following diseases

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH. 

All cases have complied with the requirements of the
Board.

 A decrease in new buildings was noticeable throughout
the year, but decided increase in alterations and repairs on
old buildings would indicate that the plumbing business was
fair, and at no particular period of the year was there decided business depression as regards plumbing.

The usual amount of nuisance notices have rived the
attention of your inspector, and owing to the new sewers put
in by the Board of Public Works, many sewer connections have
been made and cesspools abolished.

The ‘‘Rules’’ relative to the laying of sewers and drains,
passed by the Board during the month of May, have been enforced by this department with very little criticism and complaint. Owing to our sandy soil and danger from caving, an
average of three inspections have been made for each sewer
plan filed all of these are of the character known as ‘‘hurry
ealls,’’? and in many cases the inspector has had to stay on
the job while pipe was laid. It is therefore easy to determine
what the result will be during year when building is good
and many sewer connections are made with the nssary
number of inspections.

In conclusion I desire to thank the members of the Board
for their courtesy and co operation.

Respectfully submitted,
F. L. AVERY,
“Inspector of Plumbing.

Report of Bacteriologist.
To the Board of Health of the City of Holyoke, Mass.

GENTLEMEN I herewith submit report of cases referred
to me during the nine months ending November 

I was appointed by your Board early in March and the
first cases were examined by me March d, The many advantages of having this work done in local laboratory have
since been demonstrated, the chief one being that swabs may 
now be handed in as late as nine o'clock and be reported the
following morning, whereas formerly unless swab was in be ,
fore four o’clock it would have to wait over until the following day.

I would recommend that box for swabs be placed in the 
vestibule of the City Hall at the High street entrance. This

 would be of great convenience to the physicians and furthermore, the swabs would always be deposited in ene place
whereas they are now left at the Board of Health office until
five o’clock and after that at Ball’s Drug Store.

The number of examinations during this time has far exded that of any period of similar length in the past, or, in
fact, that of any full year. The total examinations being
 as against for the full year of In measure this
is due to the fact that the months of June, October and November showed an unusually large number of new cases, but
what particularly served to cause the pronounced increase in
the total number of examinations was the ruling of your
Board in June to the effect that two consecutive releases would
be required from each ease of diphtheria. Although the later
procedure was the intention of the Board when it first adopted
laboratory methods some eight vears ago, the plan has not been

 REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.

. earried out for some years past. The efficiency of this plan
has been amply demonstrated since its adoption in June by the
fact that there have been in six months nineteen instances when
a case has shown positive release culture after once having
been found negative. This result may be due to one of several
causes, the swab reported negative may have been taken soon
after the local application of an antiseptic solution, or in an
instance when there is more than one ease in family, the
throat at the time of taking the first swab may have been clear
of organisms, whereas during the time intervening between
this and the taking of the second, the bacilli may have been
transmitted from the other patient. This as cause may seem
far fetched, but to my mind it is not at all improbable when
one stops to consider that bacilli may be found in, the throats

“ of persons who, while themselves showing absolutely no symptoms of this disease, have been exposed in some manner, as in
the case of nurse or other attendant. Again, some of the
physicians take release swab just as socn as the membrane

. clears up which may be in some cases in three or four days.
This should not be done and in mest cities such swab would
not be accepted at the laboratory. I would suggest that a.
rule be adopted to the effect that release swabs will not be accepted until at least ten days after the case has been reported
positive. In Springfield the time is set at fifteen days and
there is talk of increasing this to twenty.

Although the matter has been menticned frequently in
the past, I again call attention to the fact that single negative repcrt from the labcratory shculd never be accepted as
vonelusive in cases which clinically appear positive or even
suspicious. Not infrequently it is possible to make unqualified
diagncsis on single swab, owing to the fact that the morphology of the Klebs Loeffler bacillus may be extremely variable and may approach form which bears striking resemblance to the so called pseudo diphtheria bacillus. Again,
there may have been some slight misstep in the taking of the
swab or in inceulating the media, and for this reason I inREPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH. 
variably request confirmatory swab when the attending physician hands in clinical diagnosis of diphtheria, and the or ganisms are not found in the laboratory.

All cases of membranous croup should be reported regardless of the laboratory findings.

TUBERCULOSIS.

The number of specimens of sputum sent in to the laboratory was almost twice that of last year when this branch
of the work was first undertaken by your Board.

It is still small, but the members of the profession are
daily realizing more and more the importance of this aid to
diagncsis. Further, some of the local physicians are not aware
of the fact that your Board causes these examinations to be
made free of cost.

TYPHOID. 

Only ten blood specimens were submitted to me for examination during the past nine months, and of these none showed
a positive Widal test.
