REPORT OF THE

To THE Boarp oF HEALTH oF THE Crry oF HoLyoKr, Mass

Gentlemen I respectfully submit the following detailed
report of the Board of Health as carried on under the
direction of its Health Officer.

GENERAL ITEALTH

It has been well said that with well organized Health
Department, community may have as much health as it is
willing to pay for. ,

A low death rate is one of the best indications of the
eeneral health conditions of the community. During the
past year our death rate was lower than any year for a
lone time.

Life and happiness depend wholly upon good health.
This being purchasable, the responsibility of its purchase and
the health of the community is placed squarely upon the
shoulders of those charged with making the appropriation for
health work. 

Many complaints of all kinds have been rived and
careful attention has been given to each one and steps taken
to improve conditions and remove the cause.

The general health of the city is influenced by many
factors and in order to accomplish the best results, the Board
of Health must cover many lines and each year sees an inerease in the amount of work required of this department, not

only in the prevention of contagious diseases, but in many
 lines bearing upon the safeguarding of the public health.
 The contagious disease tables and the mortality records ,
also show an evidence of its healthfulness, and by comparing
these rates for number of years the information is valuable.
