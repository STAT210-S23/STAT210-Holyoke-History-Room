Plumbing inspections 

Water tests made 

The usual number of complaints have been investigated
and nuisanees abated where found.

A decided increase in plumbing is noted and the department has been taxed at times to give prompt service.

The Inspector would again eall attention to the growing danger from explosions of hot water boilers. With the
installation of many heaters the old serviees In many cases
being practically filled with rust or provided with pressure
regulators and with no provisions or law making the use of
the safety valve compulsory, the danger of explosions is apparent. In many cities the water department provides for
the use of the relief or safety valve and its inspectors enforce
the provisions.

Your Inspector would suggest that mandatory laws be
passed providing for the installations of safety valves on all
vessels, boilers, ete., where water is heated under pressure.
