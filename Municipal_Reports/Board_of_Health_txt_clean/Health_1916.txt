REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH. 
POLIOMYELITIS.
Infantile Paralysis.

In the epidemic of Poliomyelitis which during the past.
summer originated in New York City and spread over the
eastern states, perhaps no city suffered more than Holyoke
in proportion to its population. It is true that quarantine and
other methods of handling the situation may have varied somewhat with these difficult places but unless our present conception of the epidemiology of Poliomyelitis it is hardly conceivable that this variation in methods should have been the sole
cause of such wide difference in prevalence ia the different
places concerned.

We had reported from August th to November th,
one hundred fifteen cases with twenty six deaths all but
seven cases were removed to the Isolation Hospital four of
the cases were moribound when reported. 

An emergency loan of $. was made of this amount
$. has been expended to date, with several bills for
groceries and physicians not yet approved. Disbursements
have been made to the following named persons

have been installed, connections made with the public sewer
and the city is practically free from vaulcs or cesspools.

Numerous complaints have been investigated and abated
on verbal notice from the inspector and no record has been
made of same.

Three general inspections have been made of the saloons
and the majority have been found to comply to the rules of the
Board of Health.

The decrease in the number of sewer inspections is caused

 bv the laying of lateral sewers from the main to the building
line by the Sewer Department.

have furnished their cars for transportation thereby avoiding
expenses and delay, also the members of the department for

 their courtesy and co operation.
