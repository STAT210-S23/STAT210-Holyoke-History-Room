REPORT OF THE
To His Honor, the Mayor, and the Board of Aldermen of the

City of Holvoke.

Gentlemen The thirty second annual statement of all
matters pertaining to the Board of Health for the year ending
November thirtieth, nineteen hundred twelve is hereby submitted for your consideration.

ORGANIZATION.

The members of the Board of Health met for organization
the first Monday of February, nineteen hundred twelve and
elected the following officers Maurice Lynch, Chairman,
J. Joseph Carroll, M. D., Secretary and Bacteriologist.

Appended are the reports of the Health Officer, Inspector
of Plumbing, Inspector of Milk, Inspector of Meat and Provisions, Bacteriologist and Superintendent of the Holyoke
Sanitarium, also the mortality tables and records of the registration of contagious diseases with record of the office work
and statement of the ripts and expenditures.

Regular meetings of the Board have been held the th of
each month and special mectings when nssary.

Many complaints of all kinds have been rived and careful attention has been given to each one and steps taken to better
conditions and remove the causes.

The general health of the city is influenced by many factors
and in order to accomplish the best results the work of the Board
of Health must cover man lines and each year sees an increase
in the amount of work required of this department, not only

 REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH
in the prevention of contagious diseases but in many other
lines bearing upon the safeguarding of the public health.

The general health and its freedom from communicable
diseases with the sanitary protection afforded by its sewerage
system and water supply has its influence on its growth and
these features in our city make commendable showing.

The contagious disease table and the mortality records
also show an evidence of its healthfulness and by comparing
these rates for number of years the information becomes
valuable.

The work of caring for persons in quarantine has assumed
larger proportions and will continue to increase as work formerly
in charge of the Overseers of the Poor now comes under the
supervision of the Board of Health as required by the Revised
Laws, Chapter Section .

The Board of Health of city or town shall to the exclusion
of the Overseers of the Poor retain charge of any case arising
under the provisions of this Chapter in which it shall have
acted.

This nssitates larger appropriation for quarantine
fund which the Board strives to use in judicious manner.

TUBERCULOSIS HOSPITAL.

The ‘Vuberculosis Hospital has been in operation. since
February th, this being the date the first patient was
admitted and has proved conclusively the nssity and desirability of such an institution in our city.

There have been forty seven patients rived at the hospital, the conditions shown and the results obtained in the cases
rived proves also the need of continued work along these
lines upon broader basis.

Rnt figures show there are now cases of tuberculosis in Nlassachusetts and accommodations for not more than
 patients. Ttus to the credit of the City of Holyoke that t
we are among the first who have established hospital for

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH 
tuberculosis and that our hospital has been approved by the
Trustees of Hospitals for Consumptives.

The matter of the enlargement of the hospital will have to be
considered in the near future, so great has the nssity become
to admit new patients who cannot be accommodated at the
present.

We cared for fifteen patients in state sanitariums and thirty
six persons were assisted at their homes during the vear.

SMALL POX HOSPITAL.

The readiness of this Ilospital at all times was very con
venient during this year as it was found nssary to use It
during some part of four different months of the year.

The fact that smallpox could be present in the city during
four months of the year and cause no epidemic is undoubtedly
due to the persistence with which the vaccination laws have
been enforced. It would not be difficult to see what might and
probably would have happened if the hundreds of children
vaccinated during the last two years had been left without
that protection.

 The total cost of paticnts and persons quarantined was
$. .

There were six patients treated for small pox at Tillside
Hospital and total of persons cared for in quarantine.

The following gives the places quarantined and number of
persons quarantined therein

QUARANTINE.

A very serious problem that has confronted the Board of
Ilealth for some time is an efficient method of quarantine and
we are of the opinion that this cannot be effective until the city

 REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH

erects contagious disease hospital or the Health author aties

rigidly quarantine every person in the house containing ase

of contagious disease. 
MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS.

The Medical Inspection of Schools is an important xoart
of the Health work of the city. Its object is to increase the
efficiency of the schools by ascertaining the deviations xom
normal in the children, calling the attention of the parent to
these facts to the end that they may be remedied and by exc I uding from school those children who are suffering from comm Unicable diseases and by maintaining general supervision of the
hygiene and sanitation of the school buildings.

The actual value of the work depends upon the thorovcz & 
ness and systematic manner in which it carried out.

VITAL STATISTICS.

During the year, eight hundred eighty eight dea ths
occurred in the city, giving death rate of per cent an
thousand population. Excluding the non residents our ac &

Report of the Bacteriologist
To the Board of Health

. Gentlemen I herewith submit my report on cases referred
to me for laboratory examination during the fiscal year ending
November .

DIPHTHERIA.
Although I have found positive cultures in total of
 referred to me as against for last year we can still feel
that we have been fortunate in having so few cases. For city
of persons we have been remarkably free from this disease during the past two years.
TUBERCULOSIS.

As has been the case every year since this laboratory was
established, this branch of the work has shown marked increase
over the prding year. The increase this year is, in measure
due to the fact that the Board has required positive sputum
examination in the case of all patients admitted to the Sanitarium. 

TYPHOID FEVER.

As has been the case in past years, the number of blood
specimens submitted for Widal examination was small in pro "
portion to the number of cases reported as typhoid. I would
suggest that the Board adopt rule requiring an examination
in every case reported.

OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM.

I would suggest also that physicians be compelled to take

a smear for bacteriological examination in all cases where

 REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH
there is discharge from the eyes in infants under two weeks
of age.

Appended you will find detailed report of the examinations
made during the year. ,
