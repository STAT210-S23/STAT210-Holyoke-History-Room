May ors Inaugural Address
. a

To THE HONORABLE BOARD OF ALDERMEN:

To us who are entrusted with the municipal government
of Holyoke during the present year there comes unique
responsibility which should impress upon us the importance
of the duties which we are undertaking and make us realize,
especially, that the future of the city depends greatly upon
our acts as its officers. The year will mark the fiftieth
anniversary of the incorporation of Holyoke as one of the
cities of the Commonwealth. With the completion of the
first half century of the life of the city, it  fitting that we
should look back and pay tribute to the citizens of the years.
that have past. It was their task to start the new municipality, to guide it through its infaney and to assist it to maturly. The eity prospered and grew during those years. It
Is now our duty to be watehful that Holvoke loses none of
the dignity, character, and prosperity which were welded
into it by the sturdy people who have pr ded us. Its eontinued progress rests largely with us. Fifty years from now
the success of the city during the second half of the century
will be in review. We, who are in office at the half way
‘mark, cannot fail if the city is to go forward. realization that we are the pioneers standing at the beginning of

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS
the new era should make us exert only our best efforts and, :
if we do this, the perspective of time will tell that we have
builded well and faithfully.

While economie conditions have improved in Holyoke
to the extent that steady employment in industry is now
available to greater number, still the times are not yet
entirely normal. The demand for employment which was
made upon the city during the period following the war has. |
lessened, but has not ceased. In most instances, the requests
for work are worthy. In view of the circumstances, we canMAYOR’S ADDRESS  
not be entirely heedless to the unemployment situation which
still prevails. Partly because of this and partly because
the policy of not neglecting necessary road building is wise
One, it is planned to improve more of the city’s streets during
the year. There are many roads in thickly populated districts which must be properly cared for as quickly as possible.

Conditions which may be dangerous to the children require that the city replace the bath house, now located in
Ward Four, with suitable new building to serve the young
people of that district. The nearby river is lure to the
children of this section of the city and we should provide
attractive bath facilities, so that the dangers of the river and
the crossing of the railroad tracks will be avoided. The
prescent bath house is in very poor condition and is no longer
fitted for use. recommend that it be replaced.

The preliminary steps have been taken to acquire the
land adjacent to the City Yard to provide for expansion, and
the purchase should be completed during the vear.

The public improvements made in the past require no
recitation here as they speak for themselves. Satisfaction
has been expressed by the school authorities at the repairs
and additions which have been made to some school buildings
and at the avenues for the relief of some of the congested
school conditions, which are being opened up but there still
remains an elaborate program of necessary school extensions
which must be consumated. This program must: be met in
the near future. ,

Particularly urgent is the need for school building in
West Holyoke. recommend that ereditable school facilities
be provided for the people of that district. There is an
opportunity to purchase, on favorable terms. parcel of
land adjoining the Kirtland School. We should obtain this
land to provide playground space as soon as possible.

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS
VOCATIONAL SCHOOL SUPERVISION
The public school system in Holyoke now has division
of authority in that all schools, excepting the vocational
school are directly under the control of the School Committee.
The Vocational School is managed by Board of Trustees,
consisting of nine members, five of whom must be members
of the School Board. Under existing conditions, administration costs are increased and savings in educational expenses
are more difficult. There is-a duplication of effort along
some lines and economy suffers. Reduced administration
costs, with greater efficiency and increased benefits to the
pupils should be accomplished, if all the pubhe schools were
placed under one head. recommend that the vocational |
sehool work be placed within the sole control of the School ,
Committee and that the Board of Trustees of the Vocational
School be abolished. |
Tne MitkK STATION
Despite the benefits which have been brought about by |
the preparation and dispensing of pure milk for infants under the direction of the Child Welfare Commission, so called,
the Legislature of last vear, because of constitutional objections, refused to legalize expenditures for such purposes in
Holyoke.
It seems that, considering the accomplishments of the
milk station, there must be some way in which the city can
legally carry on, or assist, in this work. The preparation
and distribution of milk under capable and intelligent supervision means much for the health of many babies and for |
the future of the eiy. To the end that this good project
may continue, propose and recommend that bill be draft- |
ed, which will make the conduct of the milk station an agency  
designed for the protection of health, and thus avoid, if |
possible, some of the constitutional questions, and that the
|

MAYOR’S ADDRESS  
Legislature be again petitioned by the Board of Aldermen
and the Mayor to enact some suitable legislation which will
place the milk station on legal standing.
BUILDING ORDINANCES

Since high prices have prevailed, there has been no construction of aparment buildings in Holyoke. This is attributed to the fact that there are requirements in the building
ordinances which make the cost prohibitive. There are regu- .
lations, especially in regard to the thickness of walls, which
are in excess of the safety standards su essfully adopted in
other cities. Furthermore there have been assurances given
that more adequate building code, properly enforeed, would,
very likely, result in some reduction in the insurance rates
which now prevail in the city. In addition, it is generally
recognized that the present building ordinances are defective
in many particulars. Efforts to rewrite these ordinances
in the past have produced no results. With the revision
of the entire ordinances, which is now going on, the Board of
Aldermen will have an opportunity to redraft building
code which would be beneficial to the city. The several .
elements in the community who are concerned with building,
now seem to be unanimous that there are great number of
changes and additions which are needed. urge upon you
the importance of the matter and recommend that an entire
now building code be enacted to replace that now in effect.

City CIIARTER CHANGES

Progressive government must keep step with changing
conditions. It is the policy of the Massachusetts Legislature
to submit to the voters of any city for acceptance or rejection
at the polls any legislation which vitally affects the city.
Owing to this policy, it is possible to let the voters themselves decide what, if any, changes they desire from time to
time, and there is little danger of minority enforcing its

|
  MAYOR’S ADDRESS |
will upon the majority. There are some changes in the
city charter of Holyoke which should properly be submitted
to the people during the coming year.
The trend of the times seems to be toward the election of
publie officers for more than one year. Elected State officials and Mayors of most of the cities in the state now hold
office for two years. Every chief executive of this city during
recent years has served longer than one year term. Without
. here reviewing the arguments for and against the proposition,
for the public is well informed on the issue, propose to introduce into the Legislature bill which will place on the
ballot at the next election the question of adopting or rejecting two year term for the Mayor of this city.
There has also been much discussion in regard to the
number of members and the manner of election of the Aldermen. It is contended that board of twenty-one members
makes an unwieldy body; that beeause of its size, public attention  not directed to the abilities and acts of the individual members and that more strength would result with a
smaller city couneil. The argument is also advaneed that
the practice of electing seven aldermen at large each year
from large list of candidates causes confusion. believe
the wishes of the voters should be ascertained in regard to
this issue also and accordingly intend to petition the Legislature to establish board of nine aldermen in the city of
Holyoke, one being elected from each ward, and two at large, |
with all holding office for two years, such change of course |
being also dependent upon its acceptance by the voters. Each
of the changes perhaps necessitate changes in details, but
these will be ineidental to the main propositions.
City MARSHAL
There is still another alteration in the charter about |
which think the voters should be consulted during this year
and that is, whether the City Marshal should be appointed
|
|

MAYOR’S ADDRESS  
from civil service list to hold office during good behaviour.
Under the legislation, which am going to ask for, the question will not be whether any certain individual shall hold the
office of City Marshal during good behaviour, but whether
the Mayor who takes office after the change is accepted, if

the people see fit to do so, should appoint the City Marshal
from civil service list made up following examinations
which all could take.

There are peculiar problems in police work in every city
which need to be worked out. Because the Marshal in Holyoke is appointed by, and may be removed by the Mayor, it
has come to pass that every act of the incumbent of the office
during every administration, is viewed by great number
of people solely from the standpoint of polities. This tradition of polities often causes the efforts of conscientious |
public servants to be misconstrued and hampers the administration of the office. It is detrimental to good government
to have the impression broadeasted that police work in Hol- "
voke is guided solely by political considerations, when the
facts do not justify such conelusions. Believing that to
remove the office of City Marshal from the field of polities
will be inereasingly beneficial with the passage of vears and
will at least add more wholesome tone to the polities of the
city, am going to ask legislation which will permit the voters
to change the system, if they are dissatisfied with it, along
the lines have indicated, so that the head of the police department will be absolutely independent of polities.

PoticE DEPARTMENT

The rapid increase in the numbers and uses of the automobile makes our streets more dangerous and places on the
eity the obligation of extra precaution to make and keep the
streets safe for pedestrians and those in vehicles. At present there are several points where much travelled streets intersect, Which have little or no traffie guidance. At other

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS
places, traffic is directed by regular patrolmen, who have
had no special training in the control of traffic. In order to
adequately regulate the traffic on the streets of the city and |
to provide for police officers who will be trained in the peculiar work of the traffic squad, recommend that provision |
be made for the appointment of addition police officers. |
FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OBSERVANCE |
We cannot permit the year to pass without making some |
fitting observance of the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of Holyoke as City. To appropriately recognize the
occasion, reeommend that the city government immediately
begin to make plans and invite the assistance of other interested persons and organizations and that suitable appropriation be made for the purpose.
This year is an appropriate one in which to call for renewed interest in Holyoke and its problems. We must not
be content with passive confidence in our strength. Neither
must we be satisfied to point with pride to achievements of
the past. realization of the true situation of Holyoke cannot overlook the fact that most of the prosperity which we
enjoy has come largely through the initiative and energy of
the early settlers of the city and to the natural progress resulting from the foundations of success which were laid in ;
other years. |
In some matters Holvoke is standing still. It must |
have new industries building within its limits. It must have
people immigrating from other cities to enjoy its benefits. |
Its people must prosper and turn the fruits of prosperity into
the development of the city. Its young men must be kept
here to add their youth and vtiality, and in order to hold our '
youth we must offer opportunities to them. If the hills and
the river, which are our natural boundaries, retard our development, it may be that new territory is needed, but first
our vacant lots must be made productive. |
|

MAYOR’S ADDRESS  

Above all things our population must increase. The
fact that for the past few years there has been only slight
gains, if not an actual decrease, in our population, unerringly
indicates that there is need for much new endeavor in the
future. We must appreciate that real problem confronts
us, the solution of which should be the aim of all citizens, .
and it is ours particularly. There is nothing wrong with
the character and moral tone of the great mass of our people.
In the citizens there is the fibre and will to move forward,
and if conditions beyond our control are preventing growth,
we must devote our time to concentrating effort among ourselves and develop additional prosperity from the material
available to us. It is fitting that the fiftieth anniversary
of the city should witness the awakening and the beginning
of the impetus, which will mean advancement. We must
apply all our powers to its accomplishment.

Before closing must acknkowledge my indebtedness to
the officials of the city, and to the people, for the kind assistance rendered me in the past. look forward to similar
pleasant relations during this year. |

o  REPORT OF WATER BOARD
The Board organized for the year with Mr. Thomas J. |
Carmody, Chairman, Mr. James H. Dillon, Vice-Chairman,
and Mr. Hugh McLean, Treasurer, being the same organization as for the preding year.
It will be seen by the financial statement that the Depart- |
ment is in prosperous condition. The gross receipts for. |
the year were an increase of  over the
gross receipts for and the total expenditures were leaving cash balance on the year’s operation of ,- |
 !
The income from water rents was an in| crease of  over the previous year, the greater part
of this increase coming from the sales of metered water for
manufacturing purposes and from the inereased hydrant ren- |
tal. The balance, was received from frontage and !
service charges, new services, replacing, enlarging, repairing )
and cleaning services, opening and repairing hydrants, reseal- |
ing valves, materials and labor, leases and rentals, ice, hay, |
. wood, resurfacing streets and lumber. |
The eash balance carried over at the end of the year  s
$ this sum includes the savings of two years, which
the Board proposes to use for the partial payment of the cost |
of new  -inch main from the Rock Cut Gate House to |
Hitchcock Street. Bids were received during the past year
for furnishing the pipe for this proposed work but were so
high that the Board decided to wait for more favorable |
market, as the extension, while desirable, could be postponed !
for year.
The rate of consumption of water used during the year
was gallons per day per eapita, which is about the average rate for the past five years and may be considered satisfactory rate of consumption for eitvy where the domestic
consumption is not metered and having so large use of
water for industrial purposes. The quantity of water used
in the mills is steadily increasing, due perhaps mainly to im|

REPORT OF WATER BOARD 
proved business conditions, but may also be due in some degree to the stricter enforcement by the Department of the
rules relating to the use of free water in the Sprinkler Systems. The records show the quantity of water sold by meter
measurements was the highest in the history of the Depart| ment, the quantity sold to the mills being about per cent
more than for the previous year.

The yearly rainfall was about the average and the height
of the reservoirs was well maintained. At the close of the
year, the quantity in storage was million gallons more
than it was at the close of the previous year, million gallions of this additional storage being in the High Service Res- |
ervoir. growth of Synura in the Ashley Reservoir commenced at the beginning of the winter and lasted for several
weeks, causing very unpleasant and disagreeable taste in
the water coming from that source of supply. This organism
is very common one, found frequently in surface water sup- 
ples and was great annoyance to many other water departments in this part of the country during the past year. On
account of the surface of the reservoir being covered with
ice, it was not possible to destroy this organism by the application of copper sulphate but as soon as the storage condition
of the High Service Reservoir would warrant, water from

that reservoir was discharged into the Rock Cut Canal in such
quantity that the unpleasant odor was removed.

About mid-winter growth of Ureglena appeared in the
White Reservoir, as result of which this reservoir was out
of commission for several weeks, during which time Fomer
Water was drafted from the lower reservoir.

The Board was partially successful in its effort to obtain
a reduction in the net sum which the water takers pay
into the general treasury of the City, when the General Court
passed enabling legislation, subject to the approval of the
Mayor and the Board of Aldermen, which was generously
accorded by them and for which this Board returns its sin  REPORT OF WATER ROARD

cere thanks. By this act the hydrant rental is increased from

$  per year to  per year for each public fire hydrant

increasing the annual revenue of this Department, approximately which, by that much, offsets the increase of
about  in taxes paid by this Department on account

of the increased tax rate since pre-war times.

For the protection of the water shed and to prevent acquisition by parties whom it might later be difficult to control,
the Board has during the year purchased forty-one acre
tract, bordering on the Manhan brook, in Southampton, from
F. G. Burnham, for  per acre and has begun condemnation prodings on tracts bordering the Iligh Service Reservoir, owned by Daniel O’Connell Sons and C. F. Schuester.

The merehantable timber on the Delisle lot, in Southampton, was sold subject to the condition that no tree be cut

. whose diameter is less than inches, two feet above the
ground. Revenue to the amount of  has been produced
by this property since it was bought by the Department in  for the sum of .

A generous proposal was received from Mr. Albert
Steiger, offering to convey to the Department as much of
the land owned by him on the Whiting Street water-shed near
the Mt. Tom Golf Club as the Board may see fit to take, the
price for the land to be determined by the Board of Water
Commissioners. The Board very seldom meets with offers
of this kind in its dealings with owners of land needed for
civie purposes and it is pleased to hereby reeord its appreceiation of Mr. Steiger’s public spirited proposition.

Conferences were held with the Board of Publie Works
and representatives of the Holvoke Water Power Company,
in the matter of the removal of the water main from the location of the old highway, adjacent to the Ferry Road, as requested by the Water Power Company. This Board held its
right to maintain the pipe in its present location unt?l the
eost of its removal is assumed by some responsible party. A

REPORT OF WATER BOARD  
proposition made by the Water Power Company to the Mayor
and Board’ of Public Works that the Company will convey to
the City, land on Commercial Street for certain sum, under
conditions which included, among other things the removal
of this pipe, is now under consideration by them.
The enactment by the Board of Rules to govern the installation and maintenance of Private Water Supplies, where
the same are connected with the Public Water Supply, was
considered by the Board in conference with parties directly
interested. Final action on this matter has been deferred,
except for the provision relating to the breaking of seals where
. the Board has established the rule, which it is strictly enforeing, that except in case of extreme emergency, no seal shall

be broken until permission is obtained from the Department.

In the opinion of the Board the breaking of seals has been, in ,
a great many instances, unnecessary and it is the purpose of

the Board, with the co-operation of the manufacturers, to reduce if possible the waste of water from Sprinkler Systems

by breaking seals.

The poor condition of the highway leadiny from Northampton Street over Craft’s Hill to Easthampton, led to a
great many parties traveling that direction, often to take the
private road along the southerly side of Whiting Street Reservoir and Sheldon Avenue. This Road, while generally in
fair condition for pleasure driving, is not at all suitable for
ordinary traffic, being narrow with few opportunities for turncuts and having surface easily eut up and made impassable
by heavy trueks. The Board was therefore obliged to prevent the use of this road for general highway traffie by closing the gate at Sheldon Avenue and Easthampton Road. It
was also thought desirable to close the gates on the road leading from Northampton Street at nine o’clock P. M., to prevent the vieinity of the Reservoir from beeoming the rendez- 
vous of disorderly all night parties.

A hearing was granted to the present owners of land
west of Northampton Street. through which the Department

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD
holds right of way forty feet wide, and in the center of
which the original main from Ashley Ponds was laid. The
value of these properties has naturally increased considerably
since the main was laid fifty years ago and particularly in
recent years, due to real estate development in that section of
the city, so that their property could be developed to the
best advantage. It was the desire of some of the owners that
the pipe be taken up from its present location on private land,
for which the department paid full damages at the time of
installation, and re-lay it on the public highway. When explanation was made to the petitioners that the performance of
this work would bring no advantage to this Department and
the cost of doing it would entail the expenditure by the Depatment of sum greater than the amount invested by the
present owners, the petition was withdrawn. Whatever action
by the Board may be necessary to preserve the full rights of
the Department in this matter and to prevent encroachment
by the construction of buildings, either permanent or temporary, inside the limits of the right of way, has been referred
to the City Solicitor, whose opinion has not yet been received.
The final payment was made this year on the bonds issued
in  for the construction of the new Intake Reservoir at
Fomer. These bonds were issued in the sum of payable in five annual installments of  each, from the
earnings of the Department. In recent years, the net earnings have been small, due to the great increase in cost of
operation; Water Works supplies were difficult to obtain on
account of Railroad, Mining and Labor troubles and prices
were way up.
Wages paid by the Department were raised to, and maintained at, market figures. The Board endeavored to be as
economical as was consistent with good management and performed only such work as necessity required. No unnecessary help was employed and the Department is one of the
very few Water Departments in the Country which have not
raised their water rents within the past few vears.

REPORT OF WATER BOARD  

The extensions made during the year will be found in
the Report of the Superintendent, annexed to and made a
part of this report, and to which you are respectfully
referred.

The Board wishes to thank his Honor the Mayor, the
members of the Board of Aldermen, and the other City Departments for the unfailing courtesy and co-operation shown
by them during the past year.

Report of the Superintendent
To the Honorable Board of Water Commissioners:
Gentlemen :—
I have the honor to submit to you the report of your
Superintendent for the year  .

The consumption of water for the year, measured by the

master meters on the supply lines, was  an aver; age of gallons per day per capita. This is gallons
more than the per capita consumption for and gallons more than the average per capita consumption for the
last five years.

The rainfall for the eleven months of  January to
November, inclusive, collected at the rainfall station at Ashley Ponds was inches, which is inches more than
for the corresponding period in  .

The quantity of water in storage in the local Reservoirs,
on November was million gallons, which is  
million gallons more than the storage on that date last year.
At the beginning of the winter season there appeared a
growth of Synura in the Ashley and Wright Reservoirs, imparting very disagreeable taste, which continued during
the whole of the winter. The unpleasant result of this
growth was neutralized by discharging from the High Service Reservoir into the Rock Cut Canal, in such quantities
as could be safely spared from that source of supply.

The extension of the distribution svstem amounted to
  feet, the details of which are given in table annexed;

REPORT OF WATER BOARD new services, more than last year, were installed at an
average cost of services were replaced and services were cleaned. There were leaks on main pipe and
  leaks on services. Three new hydrants were installed
and hydrants were replaced.

The work at the White Reservoir, carried on in accordance with plans developed in  was completed this year;
all of this work was practically done by the department’s own
force, only few temporary men being engaged at any time.
The usual amount of reforestation was done this year,  
White and Scotch Pine seedlings being set out on the Whiting
Street water-shed.

The exterior of the shop, on Hampshire Street side, was
painted to correspond with the rest of the building, which
now presents neat and attractive appearance. All the property of the Department, equipment and buildings, is in good
condition.

The details of work done and information relating to the
Department is shown in the usual way in table annexed.

Thanking you for your continued courtesy and co-operation, this report is respectfully submitted. ,

PATRICK GEAR,
Superintendent

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE

Board of Parks and.

Recreation Commission
To THE HONORABLE Mayor AND BoarD OF ALDERMEN OF THE

City oF HOLYOKE.

GENTLEMEN :—We have the honor of submitting to you

the First Annual Report of the Parks and Recreation Commission, accompanied by the Financial Statement and Recommendations for the coming year. Also the Report of the
Supervisor of Recreation, which sets forth in detail the
activities under the direction of your commission. With the
appropriation for Park purposes being less than was granted
for last year, very little construction was accomplished. By
economy in the administration and careful management of
labor, we were able to maintain our parks and at the same
time do something towards the development of the unimproved portions of the system. Following is general review
of the work done during the year:
RIVERSIDE PARK

Considerable grading was done and some new trees
planted. The ravine at the south end of this park was filled,
extending the area of the park about three and one half )
acres. About two thousand five hundred loads of
loom were taken from the Prew lot which was purchased last
year. This was set aside for future use. When this new

PARKS AND RECREATION COMMISSION  tract  completed it will be very valuable addition to this
park adding about eight acres to its area. It will furnish an
ideal location for an athletic field. The athletic field and
swimming pool on this park continued in popularity and were
patronized during the season by many thousands of men,
women and children.
HAMPDEN PARK
The general work and up-keep on this park was looked after
in Satisfactory manner. Some new trees and shrubs were
planted, few dead trees removed and others were filled and
trussed up.
ELMWOOD PARK
Improvement were made on this park as far as our
appropriation would allow. Dead brush was eut down and .
removed; many young trees were planted and some of the
older ones were pruned and filled. During the year the
Board of Public Works extended the sewer in the park from
Carleton Street, distance of one hundred feet. On
the Bh Street extension the pine trees were trimmed.
Dead trees and brush were removed and the park was given
a general over-hauling. The athletic field on this park was
in constant use and during the winter months the skating
rink maintained on this park was great suecess. Electric
lights were installed and with caretakers in charge every
effort was made to keep the rink in the best possible condition
and to maintain the best of order. In good skating weather
over two thousand men, women and children enjoyed
skating on this rink daily.
PROSPECT PARK
The lawn and flower beds on this park were kept in their
usual good condition. Some dead trees were removed, while

  PARKS AND RECREATION COMMISSION
others were filled and limbs trussed up. During the summer season new playground for small children was opened
on this park, which proved quite success.
| CANONCHET PARK

New shrubs were planted in this park and some new
flowers were added. The usual care and up-keep were maintained. The walks surrounding the park are in poor condition. Cement walks would add much to the beauty and
appearance of this park.

. HAMILTON ann GERMANIA PARKS

These parks have been maintained without any additional

permanent work, the past vear. The lawns and flower beds
were given the usual care and kept in the best possible
condition.
JONES’ POINT

During the latter part of the season, work was started
and an effort made to beautify this park. large area of
brush was eut and removed which improved the appearance
of the park in general. During the summer months small
plavground was conducted with one playground director in
charge. This was appreciated very much by the parents
and children in this section.

SMALL PARKS

Williston, Lincoln Streets, Hampden Street and other
small triangles in charge of this department have had the
usual care and up-keep. On Fairfield Avenue, the trees were
trimmed and filled, the shrubberies cut and trimmed, and the
parkway kept in the best of condition.

PARKS AND RECREATION COMMISSION  
PLAYGROUNDS

Very little improvement work was done on our publie
playgrounds; Elmwood, Prospect Field and West Street. :
Due to their locations they are in great demand for recreatioal purposes. They are the three largest playgrounds we
have, but of late years little development has been done on
these playfields. With little more liberal appropriation,
much needed work can be done in the proper development
of our playgrounds.

BAND CONCERTS )

The Board extends to the Farr Alpaca Company its
thanks for their generosity in donating the service of their
band for series of concerts, held on our parks, which were
greatly appreciated by the large number of people who attended them. .

RECOMMENDATIONS

Your Commission has gone on record as favoring a
Municipal Golf Course and we recommend that the city consider the purchase for this purpose. We also recommend
that the city purchase or take over by eminent domain all land
used at present for playground purposes; such as Prospect
Field, Ward Four Bath House and land adjoining the West
Street Playground which is now leased from the Holyoke
Water Power Company.

RECOMMENDATIONS

At present we have but one Bath House where children
can swim, this is located in Ward Four and is inadequate
and unfit. We recommend that this building be removed
and that the pool be extended and re-constructed.

Our Playfields, Elmwood, Maple Street, Bh Street, West

  PARKS AND RECREATION COMMISSION
Street and Prospect Field, are in very poor condition and
sadly in need of repairs as they have received but very little
attention during the past two years. This was due to the fact
. that the appropriation granted the commission has not been
sufficient to meet the upkeep or permit any improvements.
We recommend that sufficient appropriation be allowed so
that these fields be put in proper condition. They should
be re-loomed, leveled and re-surfaced.

Last year start was made to develop and improve the
Riverside and Elmwood Parks. We ask that sufficient funds
be allowed so that the work may be continued this year,

In conclusion the Board would again ask your consideration of the recommendations contained in this report, and
for the coming vear would submit the following estimates.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SUPERVISOR OF PUBLIC
RECREATION ON HOLYOKE PUBLIC PARKS
AND PLAYGROUNDS FOR THE YEAR
ENDING NOV.  TH,  .

To THE IfoNoRABLE BoarD c. PARKS AND RECREATION ComMISSION OF THE CITY oF HoLyoxKe, Mass.

Herewith respectfully submit my first report of activities under the supervision of this department on July,  .
The first meeting of this Board assumed the work of the Board
of Park Commissioners and the Playground Commission.
This came about through an act of the Legislature.

With the organization of the Board of Parks and Recreation Commission less than year ago, noticeable improvement in the efficiency of the working force of this department
became evident. The dupleation of issuing recreational —
permits has been eliminated. More efficient service te the
public as well as great saving of money to the city should
come through the consolidation of the two departments.

The question of how to maintain and improve the health of
our people has been placed before the public with more emphasis than ever before; not only with federal, state and city
officials has this subject been given the greatest consideration.
Men at the head of our large industrial corporations have set
aside recreational fields and indoor gymnasiums where the
employers have an opportunity to make for themselves better
men and better women. The weak man or woman who fails
to make proper efforts to make himself or herself physically
fit is not doing justice to themselves. Every man, woman,
and child of this city ought to be healthy. It should be
considered paramount duty for one and all. The great
things in nation’s advancement are those which the whole

PARKS AND RECREATION COMMISSION  
accomplish and the establishment by the city of recreational
grounds which will be accessible to the multitude will not only
promote wholesome enjoyment but will aid materially in promoting the health and happiness of mankind. ,

, Holyoke’s parks and playgrounds are so located that
every section of our city has within easy walking distance
either park or playground which affords to her people an
opportunity to take advantage of the many recreative activities provided for under the supervision of this department.

The playground of our people should be kept at high
standard of maintenance at all times.

Maintenance is one of the vital things of any playground
system. Improvements may be made but they will soon de.
eay if not properly maintained. If playground building
or surface is allowed to deteriorate either from lack of furncis
or neglect, much larger sum in the end is required to restore
the surface or building to their proper condition. This was
the condition with few exceptions of our entire playground
system when the newly organized Parks and Recreation Com- ,
mission made its first official inspection of Holyoke’s playgrounds. It was evident that the appropriation granted in }
years past had not been sufficient to meet the ever increasing
eost of material and labor. There is no playground in existence today anywhere, that through its ever increasing usefulness does not call for additional improvements and necessary repairs and our playgrounds are no exception. ‘The
more playground is patronized and the more progrcssive
demands of an appreciative public are complied with the
larger will become the expense of its maintenance.

SUPERVISION

The summer season of our playgrounds opened July  ,
and closed August  covered period of eight weeks. During the past year, as always we have striven for the social
betterment of the many rather than the individual develop

  PARKS AND RECREATION COMMISSION

ment of few, so that while we have on our staff individual
experts in Athletic, Dancing, Basketry, Sewing, and other
activities their task is to inspire the many with the way of
spending their leisure time and not to coach to high efficiency single team or individual.

The hours of the workers were divided into shifts so that
the various centers might earry on their programs, mornings,
afternoons, and evenings.

Supervised play, swimming and industrial work were
conducted as follows:

A. In School Yards:
Elm Street, Hamilton Street, Morgan, Kirtland, Highlands, Ingleside, and William Whiting Schools.
B. On Public Playgrounds:
Elmwood, Maple Street, Hampden Street, West Street
and Prospect Field. |
C. On Puble Parks:
Springdale, Prospect and Hlighland Parks.
D. At Bath House and Shower Baths, Ward Four and
Whiting School. .
EK. At Wading Pool:
Springdale Park.
PHYSICAL EDUCATION

The Department of Physical Education for the boys and ,
girls received more attention than ever before from the directors. More organized games especially for the younger
children were carried on under the direction of trained play
leaders. The activities were of great variety, meeting the
needs and desire of the different classes, and groups of children in attendance. Industrial work, Folk dancing, athletics,

PARKS AND RECREATION COMMISSION  
games and story telling are included in the daily program,
with the varied schedule for the different activities arranged
at the playground office. Care had been taken to adopt the
events to the strength and the endurance of the boys and girls
who enter the games. Ipter-playground competitive sport
such as base ball, and track athletics were arranged for the
boys and girls.

The many complimentary remarks from the people of our
city and visitors from out of town who have visited the playgrounds and expressed themselves as pleased at the varied
program of educational activities under the supervision of the
Park and Recreation Commission, have been appreciated by
the Playground staff.

| FOLK DANCING

Mary A. McCormick, SUPERVISOR

Folk dancing was more popular than ever the past
season under the careful direction of Miss Mary A. McCormick. Each playground was visited twice week and one
hour each day devoted to the folk dancing on all of the playgrounds. Folk dancing stands out prominently. It is no
longer necessary to urge its advancement in the educational
world, for it has taken its place definitely as needed form
of recreational activity. The simple and obvious reason for

 this success is found in the healthful exercises which the
folk-dance affords. This success becomes immediately evident when one notes the hearty delight of our girls when participating in these dances, and from this participation they
derive more vigorous evercises than they would through less
enjoyable movements. |

In addition, there is the love of beauty and rythm for
which modern life seems to afford lhttle opportunity, love
which expresses itself spontaneously in folk-dances. There
is connected with folk dancing love of the open, of vigor
and of joy of activity for its own sake.

  PARKS AND RECREATION COMMISSION

Dancing is the first of the arts and the most intimate
parent of all the rest and most available for the great majority of people. It is the inmost circle of emotional expression.
the first and most exuberant utterance of the joy of life.

Through the folk dances we have many opportunities to
educate the social and moral side of the child, and to direct
the formation of right habits and high ideals of conduct.

INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT
BASKETRY AND CHAIR CANING
Miss Brive C. HERBERT, SUPERVISOR

The educational value of Holyoke’s pubhe playgrounds
has been clearly demonstrated and numerous compliments
were received from educators, social workers and those interested in the playground movement who expressed their approval of the quality and wonderful work accomplished by
the children.

This department has shown wonderful advancement under the Supervision of Miss Bride C. Herbert, who deserves
great credit for the work accomplished. The suecess was not
alone in the amount of work completed but also in the quality
of the work. The girls on each playground are divided into
groups: The elementary and the advanced. With this plan
and the co-operation of the girls with their teachers, large
amount of work was accomplished during the playground

  PARKS AND RECREATION COMMISSION
season. Picture frames, napkin rings, whisk broom holders,
and book marks were made by the younger children. Braided
raffia work brought forth mats, dolls’ hats, tea pot mats and
baskets. Baskets of all kinds were turned out by the older
girls. The sewed baskets made of raffia and reed were beautifully designed and proved valuable additions to many homes.
Pine needles made very attractive basket and were in great
demand. Woven reed formed the most attractive trays. For
these trays wooden base is used, and the foundation is made
attractive by the use of cretonne under the glass. They were
stained to match the lining and were considered the best articles made on our playgrounds. Chair caning increases every
year. The boys were furnished with cane and were allowed
to cane aS many chairs as they pleased. Over chairs
were reseated during the season.
SEWING DEPARTMENT
Mrs. Mary KosteENBADER, SUPERVISOR

As in previous years instructions in the needle arts
were given daily on all play centers. Each playground was
visited onee week by the Supervisor who planned and designed the work. The course was practically the same as
other seasons. The newest patterns and latest style garments interested the girls. Materials were generously suppled by the commission at very small cost per child.

This course in sewing on our playgrounds has been found
practical and satisfactory. Each season the interest in the
work increases and new ideas are constantly introduced. This
year millinery was introduced and number of beautiful and
useful hats were made. The girls furnished the frames and
were taught to adjust the frame to the proper lines to make
it becoming. The correct method for sewing the straw braid,
the simple and girlish trimmings and the hnings of the hat
was the course used.

Through the faithful co-operation of the directors and

PARKS AND RECREATION COMMISSION  
kindly assistance of the supervisor, sewing is well established
in the Holyoke playgrounds, and its necessity is known to all
interested. The girls are receiving other instructions under
pleasant conditions and gaining knowledge other than the

SKATING |

Four skating rinks were maintained during the winter
months as follows: Hampden Street, West Street, Joseph
Metealf School, and Newton‘s Ponds.

The weather was exceptionally good for this kind of sport,
while the season was late, as skating did not start until about
Christmas week. it was enjoved for eight weeks. Electric
lights were installed at each rink. Caretakers were plaeed
in charge to keep the rinks in good condition, and the best
or order was maintained. Sliding on Suffolk Street was
enjoved by thousands of boys and girls during the evenings.
This proved popular pastime. Permission was granted
by the Board of Publie Works to close this street from School
Street to Walnut during the hours from to P. M. Caretakers were in charge and the surface was kept in good condition when the weather permitted.

EVENING SESSIONS
Five Playground: Elmwood, Maple Street, Hampden
Street, Morgan School, and West Street, were opened evenings
with supervised play from to P. M. during the
months of July and August.

The playgrounds selected for the evening sessions were
those located in the thickly populated sections of our city.
Advantage of the extra hour of daylight was taken by all
persons seeking outdoor recreation. During the evening
hours the baseball diamonds on the various playgrounds were
used exclusively by those who were employed during the day
and large number of adults eould be found on any pieasant
| evening taking part in the different activities. The primary aim of this department is to provide suitable recreation
grounds where all citizens may meet for physical improvement and mental relaxation, to encourage and promote the
practice of beneficial sports and games. In addition to the
physieal well-being resulting from open air sports, it must
never be forgotten that justiee. fair play, and unselfishness,
are absolutely necessary ino any worth while character.
During the eight weeks that the four playgrounds were open
the total attendance was  The average nightly attendance was on all grounds together.

BASEBALL LEAGUES

The national pastime baseball, as might be expected, was

  PARKS AND RECREATION COMMISSION
the most popular game on our local playgrounds. During
the summer months our baseball diamonds were in constant
use in the afternoon and evenings, and on week days, also
holidays and Sundays. The past season there were more
organized baseball teams than ever in the city. The City
League which is financed by the Park and Recreation Commission, had very successful season. This league  the
center of attraction as the league is composed of teams representing the leading athletic clubs of our city. At the opening of the season meeting was held at which Thomas McCullough was re-elected president. board of directors was
elected and schedule of games was arranged. It was
evident from the start that this league would have hard
time tt keep up its schedule during the season, as number
. of the leading players on the different clubs were playing in

the various shop leagues. Through the untirtng erforts of
Mr. Thomas McCullough the league pulled through the season playing of its schedule games. 

Our baseball diamonds were in great demand this season
and many requests from independent teams for use of the
grounds were refused, as all available diamonds were in use.
There is an urgent need for more baseball fields in many see.
tions of the city. .

SWIMMING AND BATIIING

The physical benefits derived from swimming are so
valuable to the boys and girls that the privilege should be
extended as rapidly as conditions and money will permit. At
the present time we have but one bath house located in
Ward Four, which is crowded to capacity during the summer
months. There is great demand for bette: swimming
facilities. It should be taken into consideration that when
children cannot have the chance in that house under the supervision of capable instructors they will turn to swimming
in the river which is dangerous practice. Year after year

PARKS AND RECREATION COMMISSION  
the building of more bath houses is suggested but nothing
in the way of funds to construct them has materialized.

PLAYGROUND BASEBALL
To give every boy an opportunity to play basenall is one
of the problems of playground director at the start of the
season three leagues were organized: The Midgets, the Juniors,
and Senior Leagues. The weight limit in each league was:
Midgets, pounds; Junior, pounds, and Seniors,  
pounds. The selection of the boys to represent the different |
teams is left entirely with the directors. This insures keener
competition, creates better feeling and prevents the possibility of getting the majority of the best players on one team.
The grounds represented were: The Elmwood, Maple Street,
Chestnut Street, Hampden Street, West Street, and Morgan
Schook The Midget League played schedule of twenty
games. The games were played on Tuesday and Thursday
mornings. The Juniors and Senior leagues played schedule
of thirty games. The Junior league games were played on
Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings and the Senior
league games were played on Monday, Wednesday and Friday
afternoons. total of one hundred and fifty games were
played representing two hundred and sixteen different boys.
Fast, clean baseball characterized all the games and great
interest was shown in each league. The games were witnessed by thousands of spectators and friends of the boys.
Silver cups were presented by the Park and Recreation Commission to the winners In each league. Morgan School was
the winner in the Midget League. West Street won the Jun. PARKS AND RECREATION COMMISSION
ior League, and Chestnut Street earried off the honors in the
Senior League.
SPECIAL EVENTS

The special events which were held during the season are
all worthy of mention. At the start of the season meeting
of the Directors and workers was held at the playground office and plans were talked over to stimulate and increase the
attendance. It was decided to hold such events as Baby
week, Doll show, Doll carriage parade, carnival and pienie
week, movie day and mothers’ day. Each director planned
her program and looked after all of the details and in many
cases co-operation from the people in the neighborhood was
the means of making these special days very successful.
Hundreds of people witnessed and participated in these

, events. The celebrations were held on school centers as well
as on the large playgrounds. Some were held indoors and
others out in the open. The Baby parade was the most popular event held and brought out the largest attendance.

FIELD DAY AND INTER-PLAYGROUND MEET

The annual Field Day and Inter-play-grom:a meet was
held on Prospect Field Thursday, August  This event
is always looked forward to with great interest by the boys
and girls as all compete for the championship of the city in
their respective division, the Midgets, Juniors, and Seniors.
The events consisted of Relay races, return races, throwing
the playground ball, and yard dashes.

First, Second and Third prizes were awarded the winners in each event. Six playgrounds were represented and
the grounds scoring the greatest number of points received
a silver cup. This was presented by the Park and Recreation Commission and was won by Maple Street.

REPAIRS AND EQUIPMENT
During the past season some much needed repairs were
made and but very little new equipment was installed on our
playgrounds.
PROSPECT FIELD
At the opening of the season the Baseball field was
harrowed and rolled, some new loam was added and the field
put in fair condition. The blhers were repaired and
painted.
HAMPDEN STREET
New chains and rings were placed on the giant stride.
and some of the chains on the swings were replaced and the
fence painted.
| MAPLE STREET
 he apparatus on the ground is in very poor condition
and should be replaced the coming season. The swings and
slides were repaired and put in as good condition as possible
and the baseball back-stop was repaired and painted.

  PARKS AND RECREATION COMMISSION
ELMWOOD

A new back-stop was erected. The baseball field was
rolled and put in good condition and new chains put on the
swings.

WEST STREET

The blhers on this ground were entirely gone over and
new plank seats were put in to replace those that had rotted
or which had to be replaced. new back-stop was built and
a hand ball court added. The base ball diamond was harrowed, re-surfaced and rolled, and all the equipment was
painted.

MORGAN FIELD

This ground was re-surfaced and rolled and put In good
condition. |New chains and seats were placed on the swings
where they were needed and all the equipment was painted.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Swimming: For number of years have asked for better swimming facilities and nothing has been accomplished
in this direction. The erection of more modern bath houses
should be attended to. At present we have but one bath
house located in Ward Four. This  inadequate and unfit.
I would recommend that this bath house be taken down and ,
more modern bath house constructed in its place, and special
appropriation be asked for so that one bath house may be
erected each year in different sections of the city.

BASEBALL AND FOOTBALL FIELD

There is great demand for more baseball fields. I
would recommend that two more diamonds be constructed on
the newly acquired Ball property.

 
}  
APPARATUS
More new and up to date apparatus is needed on several
of our playgrounds. would recommend the purchase of
two giant strides, twelve sets of baby swings, and three slides
to be placed as follows:

At Kirtland School, one giant stride; at Prospect Park, four
sets of baby swings, one slide and one Giant stride; at Hampden Street, four sets of baby swings; at West Street, four
sets of baby swings.

 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

A few words of acknowledgement are due to those interested in the ever growing sentiment for better play in Holyoke. The splendid spirit of the corps of instructors and
the hearty co-operation of the various city departments, private concerns and individuals helped to make the pfayground
season of stand out prominently in real achievements.
Special thanks is due the school board for granting the use of
school buildings and grounds for play purposes.

A word of thanks must be extended also to the Farr Alpaca Co., for the use of their band in furnishing band concerts on our playgrounds, also the Faleo Association for the
use of their field for baseball. The Holyoke Transcript and
The Telegram, The Springfield Republican, The Springfield
Union, and Daily News, splendidly supported the playgrounds
and were generous with space given to playground news. This |
was greatly appreciated by this department.

In closing my report wish to extend my sincere thanks
to the members of the Park and Recreation Commission for
their hearty support and co-operation in making out the
details for the development of our playgrounds.

I also wish to express my sincere appreciation to Superintendent of Playgrounds, Mr. Michael J. Gleason, and Superintendent of Parks, Mr. William J. Crosier, for their untiring
efforts and ever willing assistance. .

Respectfully submitted,
P. H. KeEtiy, Supervisor.

PART I.
School Board Report
To Tue MAyYor AND THE CITIZENS OF HOLYOKE: )

For several years now the School Board has been striving
to supply the requirements of the educational program outlined and approved for this city. The school year  ,
from our standpoint. is remarkable because of the definite
progress made in this direction. In addition to earing for
the ordinary needs of the schools, viz., the providing of sufficient seating accommodations for growing and  shifting
school population, the prudent supervision of school expenditures, etc., we have during the past year applied ourselves
to the task of supplying facilities for the performance of
activities long since initiated.

During the past few vears the scope of public school
work has been marvelously extended. Edueational needs seem
to have grown apace, and edueational efforts to have become more and more ambitious. Today the schoois are dealing not with the development of the child alone, but with tne
adult mind as well. In short, broader vision and surer
understanding of the whole school problem have pervaded the
field of school administration.

The logie of the situation is such that school boards everywhere have been forced to enter upon new period of
constructive work and to assume heavy burdeu of school
modernization. This new spirit is reflested in our own
system, in the changed methods of classroom proeedure in
the elementary schools, in the Junior High School organization, in the special classes for exceptional children, in more

. REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
unified and effective high school program, in our rejuvenated
evening schools, and in our Continuation School, Americanization classes and Evening Practical Arts classes for women.
Holyoke has retained her place in the van of cities adopting
and employing modern practices.

Aside from its purely educational features, the introduction of the Junior High School meant to the School Board
( the concentration of all seventh, eighth and ninth grade
pupils of the city in few conveniently located puildings, and
( the need of equipping those buildings for the carrying on
of the kind of work recommended for pupils of that age and
development. To some cities where this tvpe of organization
prevails, it meant the erection of entirely new buildings, iffering radically from the traditional schoolhovse and designed especially for the work that was to be done in them. However, because of the expense and because, too, our investment
in school buildings in the several localities was far from
liquidated, we could not adopt this latter plan. Our grammar school buildings had to be converted into Junior High
Schools. This involved considerable remodelling; school
basements had to be turned into work shops and laboratories
and grade classrooms equipped for the departmentalized
teaching of secondary school subjects. This work has been
quietly going on for the past two years, and with the installation of new sewing rooms and cooking kitchens in the Highland and West St. Junior High Schools during the pas year
was practically completed. To be sure we lack gymnas:wns
for some desirable work in physical edueation, but through
the availability of school auditoriums for class exercises, this
eondition has been partially modified. Save for the Lawrence School, our Junior High Schools may now be sain to be
satisfactorily arranged for effective. work.

Another matter which has long engaged the attention of
the School Board is the establishment of special classes for
exceptional children. Our school officials in their annual
reports have repeatedly emphasized this need. To great

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS .
extent their recommendations are being realized. We now
have in the city three special classes; in the Elm Street
School an ungraded class for sub-normal children, in the
Hamilton St. School language elass for the over-age nonEnglish speaking pupil, and in the Morgan School general
class for the adolescent child in the elementary grades. Gradually the regular classrooms are being relieved of unusual or
seriously retarded children. The matter is not entirely
disposed of, however, because in all sections there is growing demand for special work among baekward children; while
there are now enough names on the waiting lst to fill two
more sub-normal classes. It is hoped that during the eoming vear at least one more elass for the sub-normals will be
established, and that further step will be made in this
direction in the separation of boys and girls of this type.

The Board of Public Works aided the Sehool Board in
remedying gross conditions of long standing by installing
electric hghts in the Lawrence School, changing the lighting
system of the Iligh School, redecorating the West St. School,
placing cement floor in the basement of the Highland
School, and enlarging small rooms in the West St. and Wim.
Whiting Schools which have apparently become permanent

: classrooms for overflow groups. In spite of these improvements the school buildings generally are not in thoroughly
satisfactory condition. The High School still needs to be
renovated; our elementary buildings still lack eleetrie hghts
and slate blackboards, and much work remains to be done on
the outside of all of the buildings. This Board looks for
eontinued activity in this regard because the least neglect
will speedily manifest itself in the costly depreciation of
publie property.

Acknowledgement must also be made to the City Government for acquiring the land adjoining the Wm. Whiting
School property, for playground or for future expansion.
It was an act performed with due regard for the fundamental interests of the school children.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCTIOOLS  

Perhaps the most important improvement which the
School Board was enabled to have accomplished during the
year was the remodelling of the Nonotuck St. Sehool. It
is unfortunate that such worthy enterprise has been marred .
by the long delay in completing it, and the consequent loss
of schooling for the children of the Highland distriet. For
this latter condition the School Board disclaims all responsibility. Time and time again in public meetines, in published
reports, and in official communications we have urged this
matter. Only last vear in our annual report, spurred on by
the recollection of the fires in the Ewingville and So. Chestnut St. Schools, we condemned this building as ‘‘a serious
danger point in the school system’’ and sought its reconstruetion. No adequate reason ean be offered for delaying the
beginning of the work until mid-July.

The renovation of the building when completed, will
serve several purposes. First of all, it will eliminate an
admitted fire hazard and. substitute usable twelve-room
schoolhouse with suitable exits and other ordinary means of .
protection in case of fire. Secondly it will relieve the overcrowded eonditions in the nearby Highland School and  per| mit the closing of the much discussed cloakroom classrooms
in that building. Finally it will allow of more effective
and more economical grouping of the children in the district and result in saving the salaries of two teachers. Some
people have thought that new building should have been
constructed, but because of the uncertain conditions of public
school attendance in that section of the city owing to the probability of new private school in the immediate future, the
present plan represents perhaps the most prudent handling
of the Highland problem.

Further increases in the September enrollment, especially in the High School and in the schools of the central district, required the placing of two more portable buildings in
the city—one in the yard of the Lawrence School and the
other at the So. Chestnut St. School. There are now three

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

such buildings in the city and all of them are located in the
central district. There they stand, an object lesson to our
citizens and mute witness to the need of new building.

Because of the innovation of these structures many people believe that the School Board favors buildings of this
type. On the contrary this Board regards them as purely

make-shift arrangement and merely accepts them as being the

best temporary accommodations available, much to be preferred to school basements, church vestries, dark stores and

other similar quarters that have been resorted to in the

past. The money invested in portable buildings might better have been applied to permanent structure. Our aim

and choice is the erection of new elementary and Junior

High School. This city unmistakably needs such building

and if the pride of our citizens is asserted and the interests of

the publie school system as well as the general welfare of the

| children themselves are preferred, that building, will not be
long forthcoming. .

. Another situation which warrants immediate correction
is the poor school facilities at West Holyoke. The schoolhouse at West Ilolyoke is an antiquated one-room affair,
which was built during the Civil War period and is seareely
large enough to accommodate twenty-five pupils. Yet during the fall term there were forty-two children belonging
to this school, seattered through the first six grades and under the direction of one teacher. Not only was the task an
impossible one for the teacher, but the room itself was too
sniall to receive the necessary furniture. So acute was the
condition that the coming of single child into the district
constituted problem. Consequently the School Board
closed the sixth grade in the building and required the children to attend the city schools.

It is manifestly unjust to compel young children to go
to school so far away from home. Many of these children
live long distances from the ear-lne. The trolley service is
very poor; they must leave home early in the morning and do

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
not return until after dark without having had anything to
eat all day save cold lunch at noon. Surely they are entitled to attend school nearer their own homes and within
their own precincts. Once more, therefore, this Board recommends that schoolhouse large enough to accommodate all
of the elementary school children in the section be erected at
West Holyoke, and that this building also contain an assembly room for general community purposes.

During the year the School Board expended for
regular schools and for Continuation School In these figures are found the best answer to the
charge that there is extravagance or lack of economy in school
affairs. The school enrollment on June  contained
  more pupils than on the same date in  Yet the  
expenditures for regular schools exded the figure
by only In other words, despite an increase of almost pupils in the enrollment of the schools and decided growth in other school activities, especially in the evening schools, the School Board expended approximately the
Same amount as in  Indeed in the matter of school
salaries the department expenditure was actually 
less than in  Besides, during the year retrenenments
were made and teachers’ positions abolished to effect an annual saving for the city estimated at In brief, by
reorganizing the system at many points and eliminating overhead whenever possible, the School Board was enabled to save
for the city an amount equal to the total cost of remodelling
the Nonotuck St. School.

To sum up, therefore, the accomplishments of this
Board for the year may be thus listed: Practically
completed the equipment of the Junior High Schools. Established two more special classes for mentally retarded children. Caused the remodelling of the Nonotuck St.
School. Changed the school lines in the Highland district in such way as to eliminate the overcrowded conditions
at the Highland School. Secured many important reli  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

pairs and needed building changes in the schools. Reeommended the enlargement of the Wm. Whiting School property. Provided two more double portable schoolhouses for
the central district. Despite greatly increased enrollment, kept down school eosts to last vear’s figures. Reorganized the school svstem at many points, abolished nine
teachers’ positions, and effected an annual saving of 
for the city. Authorized the openine up of Evening
Practical Arts classes on state-aided basis. Provided
better transportation facilities for the children of the Ashley
Ponds district. :

The recommendations of the School Board for the eoming year are: new elementary and junior high school
for the central district modern two-room schoolhouse for West Holvoke; Complete renovation of High
School building; At least one more special class for
mentally retarded children; The placing of electric
lights and slate blackboards in all buildings now lacking
them; Continuation of the policy of combining classes
and reducing school costs so that the march of school progress
may go on and innovations increasing efficiency may be
adopted without unduly adding to the financial burden of
the city.

This report would be incomplete unless some mention
were made and recognition given to the unusual number of
men and women teachers who after long years of splendid
service have left our system either because of death or on
account of voluntary retirement. These include Miss Mary
E. Lawley, for thirty-eight years teacher in the Holyoke
Public Schools, the last twenty-four years of which were
spent as principal of the important Elm St. School, retired
July Jason T. Draper, for twenty-five years head of
the Science Department in the Holyoke High School, retired
July and subsequently died on November ;
Mrs. Isabelle H. Ferry, for thirty-five years supervisor of art 
work in both the high and elementary schools, retired July

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS Mrs. Rose A. Dougherty for twenty-six years assistant to Mrs. Ferry in the elementary and junior high schools,
retired September Miss Margaret E. Swindt, for
thirty-eight years teacher in the elementary schools, retired
November Miss Margaret KE. Dixon, for twenty-five
years member of Enelish Department, Holvoke High School,
died in serviee December Miss Mabel E. Waters,
for fifteen years teacher in the Lawrence Junior High School,
died in service October .
No power of expression can properly describe the reInarkable services of these men and women; their contribution
to the life of this community and to the eitizenship of the
nation. It is seen in the offices and in the market place; in
the factories and in the homes—in the sterling manhood and
womanhood of the city.

They have now retired from their arduous tasks, to enjoy
the sunset time of life—some have gone to claim their just
reward. To the others the School Board may only wish
peace and comfort in their declining years; long hours of
happy contemplation; and the joyous repose that must inev tably come to those who spend their lives in serving others.

PART III.

Report of Superintendent
To THE ScHooL Board oF ITOLYOKE:

I have the honor to submit my third annual report as |
Superintendent of Schools for the year  This is the
fifty-ninth volume in the series of printed reports issued by’
the School Board.

ATTENDANCE

In the matter of attendance, the schools can be said

merely to have held the remarkable increase of nearly  

, pupils which they received in  On December 
the membership of the schools was pupils, an inerease
of only pupils over the numbers of the same date year
ago. Much larger numbers are predicted for the near future,
however, because of legislation pending to raise the upper
limit of the compulsory school age, Holvoke’s expanding industries, and the certain Increase In population whieh people
are looking forward to.

Although the total increase in the school figures is not
striking, nevertheless the returns from the different sections
of the city are highly interesting. Every section showed a
vain except the Lighlands and South Holyoke. The High
School has seventy-eight more pupils than last year; the
schools of the central section seventy more pupils; Oakdale
twenty-two more pupils; Ward One sixteen more pupils:
Springdale ten, and Elmwood eight. On the other hand the
Highland district lost sixty-seven pupils and South Holyoke
eighty-seven. The decline in South Holyoke is due to changes
in population and the enlargement of the Precious Blood

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
Parochial School. The loss in the Highland section cannot
fully be accounted for and is probably temporary condition.
The schools easily absorbed the new numbers without 
opening new rooms and engaging extra teachers, save the
High School which is already cramped for space, and the
schools of the central section where two more portable buildings had to be provided.
SCHOOL FINANCES
In your report, you have referred to the excellent financial showing of the Department. The expenditures for  
were: Regular Schools, Continuation School,
$ For the coming year your Superintendent ree- .
ommends slight change in the handling of accounts. Schools
maintained exclusively by the city should be grouped under
one heading, and expenditures for this purpose made from
- the Regular Schools Account. Schools which the State helps
to support, viz. the Continuation School, Evening Practical
Arts classes and Americanization Work, should be classified
in another account kuown as the State- Aided Schools Account.
Adopting this principle of division the estimated school
budget for the coming vear is: Regular Schools,  ;
State-Aided Schools, .
To return again to last vear’s expenditures, the record
of the Department is an excellent one. Despite an increase
of almost pupils over the enrollment, the expenditures for were only  greater than im the preceding year. In the matter of teachers’ salaries actually less
money was spent than in by  This commendable showing was due partly to the fine attitude of the teachers in giving up five of their ten days sick leave when the
school budget was reduced, and partly to the determination
of the School Board to abolish teachers’ positions and cut
down expenses whenever aud wherever possible. This policy
of close accounting must continue until the schools have discovered their minimum organization, Elimination and con  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ,
solidation must move hand in hand with growth and development. We must not tolerate single unnecessary item of expense lest it later become reason for not adopting some
sound and progressive school improvement.

Yet we must be careful not to go too far in our desire
to ecohomize. The pruning knife should be wielded with a
eaution.  Publie edueation is and always will be very expensive. The cost of military armaments is alarmingly
evreat: how much more should we be prepared to spend then
in maintaining the safest and the only permanent fortifications of the State—the pubhe schools. It is trite to say

that in the schools the nation finds its chief defences.

IIence it is that in dealing with the finances of the
schools we must be extremely careful. Elimination of waste
and economy there must certainly be, but the mere saving of
money must never become the foremost aim of this department. Even considerations of the publie purse will never ‘
outweigh considerations of the needs of school children among
those truly devoted to the cause of education. As Superintendent Wm. L. Ettinger of the New York City Public
Schools has so well said, ‘‘A democratie scheme of education
must not subordinate the needs of the child to the mighty
dollar that appears so formidable during budget hearings.’’

Because of rather widespread belief among our fellow
citizens, that Holyoke is spending great deal of money on
its public schools, it is pertinent to ask whether the city is
doing too much in this regard or is spending more money
than other cities of our size on education. To be sure, our
cost per capita is high and many of our teachers receive better salaries than obtain in most communities. But then we
must remember that Holyoke has much smaller public
school enrollment, and great many less teachers than you
would ordinarily expect to find in city of inhabitants. Our total school cost is far less than it ought to be
and far less than it actually is in cities of our class where
these conditions are not found.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

State reports for show that Holyoke has the highest
per pupil valuation of any city in the State outside of Boston; and ranks twenty-ninth among the thirty-eight cities
of the State in school expenditures per  valuation. In
population Holyoke is the twelfth city of the Commonwealth.
We are spending on our schools, therefore, not only much less
than we can afford to spend but decidedly less than our size
indicates that we ought to spend.

Again, Federal statistics ntly prepared show that
Holyoke ranks forty-sixth out of fifty-six selected cities of
the country between to population in regard
to the per cent of municipal funds devoted to school purposes during  Of the Massachusetts cities mentioned in the whole report, for cities of all sizes, our percentage was lower than ten other places as follows:

the Interior)
Pittsfield ........... Medford .............  
Everett ............. Newton .............  
Springfield .......... Woreester ............  
Somerville ............  Malden ..............  
Chicopee ............ Brockton .............  
ITolyoke  

These figures prove that Holyoke is aetually spending
on public education less money than the large majority of
cities of its size throughout the country and that the city  s
not as liberal in the support of its schools as less wealthy and
smaller communities. The School Department is doing its full
share to keep the tax rate however low it may be.

ScHOOL ACCOMMODATIONS There are now three major problems relating to school
accommodations before the Department. The first is the

REPORT OF TIIE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
high school building on the Maple St. playground; the seeond arises from the certain need of more space for the High
School in the immediate future: and the third has to do with
the West Holvoke situation.

The problem of school accommodations in the central
section of the city has evidently reached climax. It has
been constantly agitated since without result. In placing
three portable buildings, however, alongside of the Wm. Whiting, Lawrence and South Chestnut St. Sehools, it seems as
though we have gone the limit in adopting temporary and
makeshift measures. These portables satisfy no one. They detract from the appearance of school property, give false impressions to outsiders, are wasteful of the city’s purse, and are
scarcely adequate for school purposes. They were accepted
by the School Board under stress of great necessity, and because they were the best temporary accommodations available. We cannot longer blind ourselves to the real situation,
or delude ourselves perhaps into thinking that somehow it
will be eventually circumvented without further outlay.

A new building in this section is required for many reasons: (a) to replace the present Lawrence and South Chestnut St. Schools and the portables adjoining them; (b) to reheve the overcrowded Wm. Whiting School and the portable
building in that district. through the Elm St. School; () to
provide for certain children who are now required to go to

the Kirtland School in Oakdale, which is practically at eapacity, and the South Holyoke Schools; (d) to provide accommodations for the Continuation School; (e) to provide
permanent offices for the School Department.

The present Lawrence School ought to be replaced because it is an unsatisfactory building on account of its location, present physical condition, and lack of adaptability for
junior high school activities. Many people have called it an
eye-sore and few would regret its passing. The property it
is located on is very valuable and should be disposed of by
the city for commercial puposes,

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

The South Chestnut St. School is too small for the district it is located in, and cannot well be enlarged. It ought
to be combined with the Lawrence School to save auministrative and maintenance costs, and to enable more children to
receive the advantages of the equipment and special features
of the new building. The present building should not be
disposed of, but might be turned over to the Boys’ Continuation School.

There are public school children living in this section south of Appleton Street—acording to the December
reports. If these children were required to attend the new
school, approximately pupils would be transferred from
the Elm St. School. This latter building, by an easy
change in district lines, would serve to relieve the Wm. Whiting School. Similarly, the Kirtland and South Holyoke
Schools would be relieved, and space for the Girls’ Continuation School found in the Park St. building.

The Continuation School now holds its sessions in the
High Sehool building afternoons. It will never function
properly until it has quarters of its own. The vacant South
Chestnut St. School should easily be fitted up for Boys’
Continuation School; while the Park St. School in South
Ifolyoke would make an ideal building for the girls’ division.
Legislation is now in the making, to increase the number of
hours pupils will be required to attend the Continuation
School. If suecessful, this will create serious Continuation
School problem that we ought to prepare to meet.

| Finally the School Department offices for years have

been located in ‘‘temporary quarters.’’ Several times during that period they have been obliged to move, and we cannot hope to remain in the present building indefinitely. Besides rents are becoming prohibitive. The plans of the new

| building ought to include permanent offices for the School
Department.

Evidently then the need of this new building is varied
one, and holds the key to many vexing situations, It  estimatREPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
ed that building containing thirty-six regular and special
classrooms  necessary for present demands; and this too
without considering too much the facet of Holyoke’s expanding industries and the era of growth and development which
is generally predicted for the city.

The providing of more space for the High School is our
next imperative need. But for the reorganizations of the
school system and the adoption of the junior high school
plan, the city would several vears ago have been confronted
with this problem. Conditions now, however, are such as to preclude further delay. The present building was planned to aecommodate pupils. The D mber membership of the
school was  and eonsiderable inerease is anticipated in
september. The classes are large for high school work, and
many extraordinary and difficult adjustment have already had
to be made. It was intended that when the High School reached
its present size, tt would occupy the Vocational School quarters.
Lut where will the Vocational School go? Without knowing the
mind of the Board of Trustees for Vocational Training on
the matter, would suggest that any comprehensive building
program should contemplate the erection of modern building on the present South Chestnut St. School site, suitable
alike for Voeational School and Boys’ Continuation School
activities. .

Finally the one-room frame building in West Holyoke
should be immediately replaced with modern three-room
school building. This need is now in fair way of being |
met.

If the above recommendations seem extensive, or rather stiff
and burdensome for the city, it should be remembered that
Holyoke has not built publie school building since  This
has not been due to lack of warning on the part of school
officials, who vear after vear are accustomed to outline school
needs faithfully and clearly. It is rather due to false notions
of economy that have not moved progressively with the reSs. eo eI

quirements of the schools. Progress involves foresight and a
shrewd distribution of community problems. Those who would
interfere with the orderly procedure that must be followed
in supplying city’s wants are sowing winds, only to reap
the whirlwind.

Progress OF OvcrR PUupPILs

Many times in past reports, school officials have pointed
out the great need of special classes in the city. Their recommendations have never been carried out largely because
of lack of room and suitable accommodations. Yet the problem is so acute and of such essential importance that it cannot
be always and permanently ignored. Either space must be
provided or new principle of class organization adopted
which will make possible the recognizing of these individual
differences among children. Besides, Section of Chapter
  of the General Laws now requires cities and towns to maintain special classes for all children three years or more mentally retarded in their development. ,

On the opposite side of the page, there is an age-grade
report of the pupils in our elementary and junior high
schools. This report was taken on December  and
shows definitely the progress of our pupils. Children are
permitted to enter our first grade when they are five years
old. Therefore they might be expected to complete the
ninth year or the last year of the junior high school in their
fourteenth year. Those who accomplish this are said to
have made normal progress. They should constitute the
majority of the pupils in our schools and it  for them that
the course of study  graded. Those who require less time
than nine years after entering to finish the junior high school
are said to be accelerated, and those who require more time
are said to be retarded.

In the table given, the number of children who are normal for their age and grade is shown between the heavy faced
lines. Those who are accelerated are placed above the lines,

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
and those who are retarded or over-age are below the lines.
Pupils already in special classes were not included in the
study.

Thus it is seen that of all the pupils in our elementary
and junior high schools per cent are normal;  per
cent are better than normal, and per eent are retarded
or over-age. These figures are not unusual for they do not
differ greatly from the percentages found in other cities.
Moreover, of the retarded ehildren are one year retarded; pupils are two years retarded; are three years
retarded, and pupils are more than three years retarded.
For these two latter groups the city is definitely required
under the statutes to make special provisions. The retardation begins early in the grades and continues through the
sixth grade where there is noticeable falling off. This  s
due partly to the facet that the traditional school has lost its
attractiveness for the greatly over-age pupil and partly
beeause he reaches the compulsory school age limit and does
not hesitate to leave and go to work.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

Continuing our inquiry further we find thaz there are
this vear &&  repeaters in our schools, i. e., pupils who failed
of promotion and are repeating their work. Of this number
  are taking the same work for the second time; for the
third time; and for the fourth time.

The causes of this retardation and non-promotion may he
variously stated, but the chief ones so far as our city is enn; cerned seem to be late entering; difficulty with the English
language; retarded mental development; frequent transferring of schools; poor home conditions, and physical ailments.
How much is due to actual mental deficiency is not known
but it is probably considerable. Experts state that from
two to three per cent of school enrollment is so afflicted. At
any rate we do know that the number of children of low mentality in our schools is greater than our facilities to take care
of them.

The problem of retardation is very serious one.  ‘‘ Retardation, overageness and elimination are the sourees of
educational, economic and childhood wastage.’’ It can be
dealt with only through special or auxiliary classes. already

we have one ungraded elass in the city for children of low

mentality, i. e., those who are improvable but only at slow
rate of progress. In the Hamilton St. School, we have ;
established special class for over-age non-English speaking
children; and in the Morgan junior high sechooz we have
opened special opportunity class for adolescent children
who are in the elementary grades. In these rooms, the
pupils receive help from specially trained teachers; the course
of study is greatly modified and in the ungraded and opportunity classes great emphasis is placed upon manual activities. These three classes however must be only the beginning of comprehensive plan, which will be eity wide in
extent and which will aim to give to every child the kind and
degree of education he is capable of assimilating.

Nor should we become so engrossed in our seudy of the
retarded child as to forget our exceptionally gifted pupils.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS Ls)
They are just as much entitled to progress at rate proportionate to their ability. It is with this thought in mind we
are contemplating regrouping of the pupils througnout the
junior high school grades on the basis of previous scholarship.
If this plan is carried through, then for these puplis also
the course of study may be enriched and program of work
organized consistent with their superior ability and attainments.

Finally there should be mentioned at this point, the invalid children, the shut-ins so-called, who are unable to go to
school. These include most appealing cases: deformed
children, helpless cripples, the harvest of the poliomelytis
epidemic, and the otherwise unfortunate. At least score

of such cases are known to the school authorities of the city.
If they cannot come to us, then it seems that we should go
to them. The School Board, in their wisdom, could do no
greater act than to engage visiting teacher for such children.

Seientifie school organization, today, no longer accepts
the theory of promiscuous grouping of children in certain
class units on the assumption that mentally and physically
they conform to mythical average; but recognizes the great
differences that exist among Individuals and aims: to classify
them accordingly.

SCHOOL SAVINGS

A very popular innovation made this year was the installation of Automatic Receiving Teller machines for the collection of school savings. These machines were placed in
all of our school buildings by the Holyoke National Bank and
are proving to be very helpful devices in the teaching and
practicing of Thrift. Of course the machines themselves
mean nothing unless they are supported by an interested
and willing teaching corps. They permit of consistent every
day saving and have this added advantage, that their scheme
of operation requires actual visits to the bank by the pupil.

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

The report of the Holvoke National Bank demonstrates
their worth in facilitating Thrift. The machines were installed on October and the total deposits to December  were Besides per cent of our
school enrollment or pupils are participating in the
savings plan, holding bank books and stamp ecards.

In April  vour Superintendent will have completed
the three year term to which you elected him. It seems therefore favorable time to inquire into the state of the schools.

Have the schools progressed during that period, or have
their standards lagged or even remained stationary under
his leadership? These and many other similar questions
must await vour final Judgment.  At least there has been
growth of one kind or another and plausible efforts at development. Perhaps comparison of the school system as
it existed on June  and June  will serve as
a sufficient account of his stewardship.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

 In the three year interim, one permanent building and
three regular classrooms have been closed as result of
fires, while three double portables have been added to the
plant and two new classrooms opened up in the Nonotuck St.
School. The value of all school property in the city has inereased from  in to  in  .

But the conservation of finances, the management of the
school plant and the care of school property are secondary to
the main work of school superintendent. He is more concerned with the outlining of educational policies and the supervision of instruction. It is with regard to these two
latter things, and the influence he has exerted upon them,
that he prefers to be judged and rated. No phase of scha
work, therefore, in the past three years has escaped the serutiny of your superintendent; no department that has not
received his personal attention; no classroom that has not
been visited; no teacher who has not been observed; no unit
that has not in some degree been reorganized or altered.

A new plan for the kindergartens has been put in operation. The course of study has been changed, new materials
and equipment introduced; new scheme of sessiIcas adopted
whereby kindergartners are held responsible for two sessions
daily instead of one; and the whole work closely co-ordinated
with the first grade. ,

The course of study in the elementary grades I-VI, in ail
subjects has been thoroughly revised and enriched to meet
new conditions resulting from the inauguration of the junior |
high school plan. Some of these courses have been printed
and distributed in pamphlet form; others are to follow. Th
course of study in geography has been standardized and a
new text installed. There are now five fully equipped
junior high schools in operation whereas in there was
but one partially equipped building. The organization of
these schools: has been established in aecordance wiin the

, thoroughly safeguarded. The establishment of this work
involved many building changes and the adaptation of grammar school buildings to junior high school activities. At a
recent meeting of Hampden County Superintendents, Hol.
yoke was declared to have model junior high school plan.

The work of the Senior High School has been intensified
and broadened. The transition from the four to the three
year Senior High School plan has been safely made; the objectives of the school have been clearly defined; many new
teachers have been appointed to the faculty and the courses
have been revised to better prepare the pupils for college or
business or leadership or citizenship. The Commercial Department especially has been strengthened to meet the needs
of the community.

In all of these divisions, advanced and approved methods
of instruction and class presentation have been introduced
such as the socialized recitation, the project method, the group
method, the supervised study period, standard tests, school
assemblies, extra curricula activities; learning by doing;
homogeneous grouping of pupils, ete., and many other devices
designed to improve instruction and to make the pupil more
self-reliant and intelligent worker.

There are now three special classes for retarded children
whereas in there was but one. Besides, two new units
have been added to the system, viz., the part-time Continu ation School with membership of over employed minors
and the Evening Practical Arts classes which more than  

 women attend. Our Americanization work has been adjudged to be among the best in the State; while the work in the
evening schools is better defined and more accurately gra :
The number of sessions in the Evening Tigh School has been
reduced from four to three week. Our vacation school has

Other accomplishments of the past three years are the
introduction of milk service in the schools; the opening of
the swimming pool during the summer months for general
use by the children of the city; and extending the use of our
High School gymnasium to parochial schools and other elub
teams without charge.

In closing it should be stated that but for your own
helpful cooperation, the exceptional loyalty of all the employees of the Department, and particularly the willingness
of the teachers to assume new tasks, extra duties, and to serve
in any situation they were called upon, the writing of this

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

I append herewith the report of the Assistant Superintendent, Miss Jennie E. Scolley:

SUPERVISION

Edueational theory recognizes the svstematie development of all the powers of the growing child as the dominant .
aim of elementary education.

The teacher is the first and most important factor in securing good teaching. Supervision is an aid and becomes |
the second factor toward efficient methods and results. wSupervision, through leadership, inspiration and cooperation,
molds efficient team work with one purpose and toward a
common end—the complete development of the child.

This year has been most successful one; progress has
been made in all branches, and modern methods and practices
prevail throughout our school system.

As special attention was given this year to the better
grading of pupils, to the clearer recognition of ene Individual differences in ehildren, our schools are much better organized than they were. The closing of some of the smalr
rooms, the combining of classes, and the opening of special
classes, have resulted to the advantage of all, both ecdueationally and economically.

Special study was given to geography the past year, with
a view of improving and standardizing our course. The introduction of new geography text books helped in acecomplishing our aims. Silent reading and better teaching of spelling
was emphasized throughout the year. Supervised study and
the socialized recitation are prominent features in all schools.

It is but just that commend the fine attituae ana spirit
of the teachers at all times and reeord my praise for the excellent work obtained.

Through supervision our aim is to bring out the best
which each one connected with the system has to give, or as
Dr. Strayers says, ‘‘Inereased proficiency of all.’’

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
THE ProJect METHOD

For the past few years an intensive study has been given
to methods of teaching with view of improving classroom
instruction and classroom procedure. careful study of
the problem-project plan leads us to introduce the idea in
a conservative way, and the results have been most satisfactory.

The Project Method uses the purposeful act as unit
of school procedure. Children are to learn through purposeful activities—through projects. ‘‘Their experiences are to
be complete, to include planning and judging results as well
as executing, and they are to practice cooperation, team play,
working together.’’ We have been told that without inter| est there is no effort and little learning. Where there is a
whole-hearted purpose there is intense interest.

The Project Method is philosophy of life and learning as well as teaching. It is way of living by your own
wits and in cooperation; it is the best way of learning because it is learning by doing; it is way of teaching, of shaping the educative process, through purposeful experiences
amid social environment.

We took up the work rather slowly using extra curricula
activities at first. Now with the right kind of problems to
solve and purposeful projects to undertake, in the various
subjects, different kind of study prevails, new kind of
recitation follows with better results and less waste.

‘‘A project is any instance of activity or experience carried on under the dominating purpose of the agent, that is
the doer or learner,’’ says Dr. Kilpatrick. Individual and
group projects have been earried on successfully during the
year through which knowledge and skill in essential subjects
were acquired in most satisfactory way. The concomitant
qualities developed by this kind of work have to do with what
we eall character, as self-reliance, responsibility, cooperation,
initiative, originality, organization and leadership.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

During the week of July first an exhibit of some of the
project work of the schools was held in the Art Room of the
Public Library. Large numbers of people from our city
and surrounding places visited this exhibition and were  ost
generous in praising it.

By request we again exhibited some of the project work
of our pupils at the Hampden County Teachers’ Convention
held in Springfield, in October, and received the hearty ap- —
proval of all who examined it.

SPECIAL CLASSES

Dr. Andrew Edson, former associate superintendent of
schools in New York City, says, ‘‘ Every child in municipality  entitled to all the education he is able to take irrespective of the cost.’’ In other words, every child in our city
should have fair chance to acquire some learning provided
by our public school system.

In our study of children in the schools we find these
various groups: the gifted or super-normal, the normal, the
slightly retarded, the mentally defective and the physically
defective children. We have also in our city group of
invalid children who are unable to attend school; list of fifteen such children is at present on file in our office. recommend that visiting teacher be employed as soon as it
seems practical, who will open the gates of learning to these
young people and thus afford them some of the privileges and
happiness enjoyed by the more fortunate children of our city.

Organization of classes and the courses of study should
recognize, if possible, the needs of each group of children. The
gifted or super-normal child should be given attention im all
the plans outlined for the world needs leaders and, therefore,
schools must train for leadership.

It has been said that probably three per cent. of all the
children in the elementary schools are unable to profit by
regular grade work. Special classes are arranged for the

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

pupils who have not sucded under ordinary classroom
Instruction but who are improvable provided they can be
given the form of training that for them is educational.

We aim to discover these retarded children before they
become discouraged by repeated failures and before they are
too old. Special attention is called to individual children
who lose interest and who fall behind in their work. Consultations are held to discuss eauses of such failures; finally the
Haggerty or Binet-Simon tests are given and results tabulated. As far as possible, we place these children in special
groups. It is believed that if these retarded children are
given work adapted to their needs they will have better
chance to take their places in the world and be an asset instead of lability.

In our school system we have three special classes which
have proved to be most valuable to individual pupils and to
the whole school system. We regret that the lack of aeeommodations forbids the opening of more of these special classes
so much needed.

The first class is the over-age non-English speaking
group at the Hamilton St. School. These pupils are given
the necessary English and grade work to fit them, in as short
a time as possible, for regular grade work. Our plans have
worked out effectively for these children, and the regular
grade groups have not been held back by this type of pupil.

The seeond class is known as special sixth grade and  s
in the Morgan School. The class consists of group of boys
and girls of adolescent age who are retarded in their work.
Retardation and lack of adjustment to school life appear to
be important factors in influencing boys and giris to leave
school, There is, therefore, pressing need for study and
application of methods for the training of adolescent boys
and girls which shall make the most of whatever capacity each
MaVv POssess. |

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

Special courses, equipment, and training, are provided to
meet the varying needs of these pupils; to arouse interest in
learning and to create desire to remain in school.

The third type of special class  the atypical group which
is housed in the Elm St. School. Children of this type come
from the different parts of the city to this school. The hours
are from nine o’clock to two o’cloek. The training is of distinet type consisting of academie work, manual and physical
training. The academic work comprises reading, writing, spelling, number, drawing, singing, and special training in English
through story telling and dramatization. Physical training,
manual training and many school activities for developing
sense training are included in the course of study. The manual
work includes basketry, chair caning, sewing and brush
making.

Another class of this type should be opened at once, and
still another little later, as we have twenty-eight children
ready for this special training.

The following statistics of this school are interesting:

The school opened in  .

Mental age— yrs., mos., to yrs., mos.

Number of graduates this year— .

In all this special work, as well as in the regular classroom instruction, we purpose to give children not only the
best education along modern lines, but also try to make them
happy in their work, to love work. Our schools aim to make
society see the truest economy in happy childhood, growing
life, and creative work and play. ‘‘We must make the world
ring with the laughter of childhood and the joy of youth.’’ .

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
A MERICANIZATION

‘‘Americanization is the uniting of new with nativ:-horn
Americans in fuller common understanding and appreciation,
to secure by means of individual and collective self-direction
the highest welfare of all.”’

The work of Americanization in Holyoke, which is ecentralized under the School Department, has passed the experimental stage. The work is better understood and results

obtained more satisfactory. All realize that education as
applied to the alien furnishes the means whereby he can
sense and understand things American, particularly institutions, laws, opportunities, obligations and protection.

Edueation for citizenship is primary function of democratic government, and the educational process should apply
to the adult as well as the child.

In the reorganization of the evening schools we have
had better grading of the Americanization classes in these
schools. We aim to place specially trained teachers in charge
of illiterate minors as well as of classes for adults. More
classes and larger classes were organized this year. ‘The
Americanization work is carried on through the day an: even- .

ing schools, special classes, mothers’ classes and industrial
classes.

A Service Bureau was opened in the Chamber of (ommerece rooms in January. This is joint activity of the
School Department and the Chamber of Commerce. It  s
proving to be most helpful to the foreign-born of our city.

We have corps of faithful, specially trained teachers who
understand this great movement and are most enthusiastic,
sympathetie and conscientious in all their efforts. We believe, ‘‘There is no way by which we can make any one feel
it is blessed and splendid thing to be an American unless
we ourselves are aglow with the sacred fire—unless we interpret America by our kindness, our courage and our Sairness,’

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

We organized thirty-four classes with an enrollment of

  members. The ages of pupils were from twenty-one to

seventy-eight inclusive. The following statistics may be of

PART IV.
Report of the Principal of the
High School
To the Superintendent of Schools :—

In recent report of the committee on college entrance
requirements, submitted to the New England Association of
Colleges and Secondary Schools, it says: ‘‘The greatest difficulty confronting the public high schools is the apparent
conflict between the demands of the colleges and the demands
of the community.’’ In answer to questionaire sent out
by this committee the majority of the replies received indicate

that there is this conflict, and the almost unanimous opinion

is expressed that the community’s needs shonkt be considered first. In this school for some years the puyils have been

segregated in certain subjects according to their courses of

. study, and as the school grows it will be possiivie to apply

this assignment by courses to all departments where it can

be advantageously used. By doing this it makes possible an

expansion in the program of studies giving to each pupil particular training most suitable to his needs. It is serious question, however, whether or not the college preparatory courses ,

should not be modified so as to give pupils chance to elect

subjects other than those called for by the college catalogue.

Some colleges have come to recognize that those in charge

of the education of the boys and girls in the high schools have

the best understanding of the needs of their pupils, and that

courses of study should not be too finely determined by the

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  ).
committee of admission of college faculty. From the view
point of the high school principal, believe that ability to do
eollege work is of more importance than the completion cf
certain required subjects in the preparatory course. The
attitude of many colleges show that there is growing tendency on their part to accept the judgment of the principal
as to the ability of student, and to give wider margin in
the choice of the subjects required for admission to colleges.
This liberality would extend still further, no doubt, if it were
not for the number of students seeking admission to colleges
and the limited capacity of such colleges to receive these students.

In report of mine few years ago, suggested the advisability of establishing in our school Junior College. I
believe the need of such college is greater now than at the
time the suggestion was made, and also believe the extending
of our school into the first or second year of eollege work
would be great advantage to many pupils, and would stimulate them in the work of the preparatory course.

Many of our boys and girls cannot plan definitely on
their future career during the early part of their high school
course. If Junior College were established, they could, on
completing the high school course, take college work without —
the technical preparation now required. They would not
lose all of the work they had taken in the high school even if
it were not strictly in the college preparatory course. There :
would be more room for them in the upper classes in many of
the colleges, and the expense of the college course would be
greatly reduced.

There has been quite careful survey made of the Junior
College, the conclusions of which would be great help in the
establishing of such department in Holyoke. trust the
School Board will consider this matter seriously. believe the
result would be the founding of Junior College where many
of our students would enroll.

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

We have attempted, also, to divide our students in different classes on basis of scholarship. In several of the
subjects where the divisions are numerous, we have attempted to place the brighter students in certain divisions. This,
we find, works well for both. For long time we have plaeed good deal of emphasis on the individual pupil, but more
particularly on the pupil who was not domg good work. This
was done with the purpose of raising the student’s grade of
scholarship. On the other hand, we have not done as much
for the brighter student as we should. We have not given
him the full opportunity that the school offers for his greatest development. We must look to the schools for future
leadership, and we will fall far short in making real leaders
unless we try to give some special training to the brighter
pupils. This can be done without hindrance to the other
pupils. In fact, they will be better off under the new plan
than when placed in classes where all grades of pupils were
enrolled.

In many of the classrooms the group method of instruction
is being used. This is especially true in the English Department. Many of the English teachers are employing

 the group method for special day each week when the pupils
prepare short talks to give before the class. At the
beginning of the period the boys and girls are divided into
groups of about four each under the leadership of one of
the members of the group. Each member in the group gives
his talk and is criticised by his mates. The best speaker
is then selected from each group to appear before the entire
class. In the course of several weeks this gives cach one in
the group equal opportunity to come before the entire class.
One great advantage in this plan is that every member of
the class gives his oral composition during single recitation.
Rivalry is developed among the pupils in trying to see who
ean be the best in their group. The criticism of speaker
by his mates, is likely to be more frank and more complete in

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
. small group. In grammar lessons and in lessons on punetuation the group method is used to advantage, especially
when the pupils have written original sentences to illustrate
general principles. In such cases the class as whole first |
discusses with the teacher the principles involved, then breaks
up into groups to consider the written sentences. In this
- way the sentences of the entire class may be criticised in single period. Individual lists of misspelled words may also be
eriticised in this way. Backward pupils have been placed
under the tutelage of the better pupils in some classes, and
this has proven distinetly beneficial. In Latin the group
method is used to great advantage in translation of English
sentences into Latin, and also as kind of ‘‘follow up’’
method. Pupils may be tested by written work on what they
have done in groups. Latin comes to be live, modern subject when the pupils in the class are gathered in small groups
discussing various points of their lesson. The response and
interest on the part of the pupils show that they can work out
many things for themselves that were formerly thought necessary for the teacher to do. One of the pupils in Latin says,
‘‘The group system which is just being introduced into the
schools seems to be very good idea. In almost every class
there are students who are better informed on the work than
others. In this system the fortunate one can help the students who find difficulties in their work. The questions can
be asked more informally than if they had to be put before the
teachers and the rest of the class. It is said that in every
class there should be some sort of change in topies or short
rest. so that the work would not become tiresome. The meeting of the groups does this, because to ask questions for about
ten or fifteen minutes relieves the minds of the students. Any
kind of new idea which is just being introduced is especially
interesting, and think this system is exceptionally adapted
to first year Latin.’’

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

The Junior Achievement work carried on in classes in
Industrial Geography last year shows the group method applied to larger division with certain definite projects in
view. Mr. Burt, one of the teachers of Industrial Geography, and Mr. Baldwin, now connected with the Newton
schools, took great interest in the Junior Achievement Clubs.
They, by arousing the interest of some of the men and women
of our city in this work, are responsible in large measure for
the resulting suecess. The study of the paper industry in the
fall of led directly to the formation of Paper Club
of which Mr. Labelle, chemist of the Chemical Paper Company, acted as leader. Later on when the cotton industry
was studied Mr. Hubbard, assistant superintendent of the
Lyman Mills, consented to take charge of this club. From
time to time other clubs were started, generally the outgrowth of classroom work. nearly every case these groups
were organized as Junior .) uievement Clubs under the Junior
Achievement Foundation of the Eastern States Industrial and
Agricultural League. To coordinate the work of the several
club leaders, and to furnish clearing house for the problems
arising from the work, discussion group ealled Leaders’
Council was organized. In September,  the Cotton
Club, Basketry Club, Poultry Club and Paper Club gave
demonstrations at the Eastern States Exposition. The Cotton
Club won the grand champion prize for the best demonstration at the Exposition with fifty-six cities of the Eastern
States competing. In addition the club won four other
first prizes. For the best demonstration; For
the best cotton project; For the best industrial exhibit; For the best club song. The Basketry Club,
Paper Club and Poultry Club each won the first prize for the
best demonstration in its respeetive field. The Poultry Club
also gave its demonstration at the Holyoke Poultry Show in
the City Hall. The members of the demonstration teams at ,
the Eastern States Exposition were:

CoTTON CLUB PAPER CLUB
Dorothy Provost Sophia Bloom
Helen Popkiewicz Lilhan Nicholai
Harold Petersen Pauline Carleton
BASKETRY CLUB POULTRY CLUB
Alice Lowell Sylvia Radner
Irene J.apointe Paul Lynch
Jessie Burgess
Most of this kind of work has been more successfully
carried on in rural communities. It is great credit to the
organizers, to club leaders, to the boys and girls themselves
that in an industrial city so much interest has been aroused,
and such suecessful results have been obtained. The boy
or girl who learns things by the doing of them has not only
the facts correctly, but has training of mind and hand that
eannot be over-valued.
, Good citizenship and ethics are informally and indirectly
taught by every good teacher in every classroom exercise.
But in the past there has been no systematic formal attempt
to instruct the pupils through lessons in manners and conduet in many of the things as essential to their
success and happiness in life. At faculty meeting
held late in the fall it was the unanimous opinion of the
teachers that regularly conducted elasses in ‘‘Manners and
Conduct’’ would be of great benefit to the pupils. committee of the faculty was appointed to draft outlines for these
lessons and to issue them in mimeographed form once each
week. Fifteen or twenty minutes is set apart every Thurs- |
day morning when the section or home room teachers meet
with their pupils in diseussing the subjects outlined in the
lesson for the day. Some of the subjects so far studied are
courtesy, conduct in public places, table etiquette, personality
and neatness. The following is given as an example of one

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

of the lessons in manners and conduct. This shows well the
eontent of many of the other lessons. ‘*‘How wonderful  s
the power of Personality! As we pass through life, we unrealizingly shed radianee or shadow about us wherever
we go. Our school, our home. our room, our place of business is
very much the Echo of Ourselves! So much so that even room
empty of human beings may reflect the sometime presence
of careless, selfish person; while another radiates Beautiful Personality. Wherever we pass, we alter things little.
Things have to change because we have been. Shall we show
our passing by litter of things east about,—eviden of slovenly, untidy habits? Or shall we aim to let Sunshine, Cleanliness, Neatness follow on our trail?) As far as we ean, let
us try to show that our Home and all are the better, neater
and finer because we have lived. Let us take stock of our
room at home and our desk at school to see what about them
may reflect Order, Good Taste, Choice Personality. At school
shall there be in our wake trail of torn papers, crumbs,
orange-peel? Shall our desks and books be mistaken for
waste-baskets, or shall our mere passing through help to make
the world tidier and more attractive place? Teachers come
and go, but the school building belongs to the community. It
is monument to the habits of the people within. What kind
of pupils own it? Its appearance tells. What type of Personality are we aiming for,—one that makes or one that
mars?’’ The pubhe is demanding more and more of the
schools, and in many ways these demands are just and should
be met. If the school can supply to the world boy or girl
who has been made more efficient by instruction in some of
the things essential for his pleasure and success, things which
are outside the regular courses of study, it is helping to fulfill
its funetion in making more efficient those entrusted to its
eare and guidance.

The marked increase in enrollment demands considera- 

tion in providing space and equipment for future expansion.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
The high school building has nearly reached its capacity;
some of the teachers now being obliged to change their classroom with every recitation. While the conditions were in
part relieved by the return of the two grades to the So. Chestnut St. School, there is at present capacity use of the classrooms and the use of certain basement rooms not intended for
instruction purposes.

Many days in winter weather the basement rooms occupied by cooking, woodworking and pattern making classes
are unusable. There is no way of properly heating or ventilating these rooms. Neither is there any way of providing satisfactory additional space needed for these two important
departments. Sufficient room for the domestic science classes
to permit of all girls in the school taking certain amount of
work in this subject should be provided. Arrangements should
also be made for boys in technical and general courses in
order that they may be required to take certain amount of
shop work. This should include machine shop practice.
The vocational school director has many times called attention to the great need of new building for that school. The
present gymnasium building was planned for the expansion
of the high school. Its arrangement and situation would
take care of the natural high school growth fur sume years
to come, and would make possible better and larger science
laboratories, modern housing of the manual training department, the desired enlargement of the domestic science
courses and more general classroom space. These are real
needs and will soon demand consideration and action.

As most of the facts usually included in my report relating to the graduating class are matter of record either
elsewhere in the sehool report or previously given publicity
through the press, it is unnecessary to include them in this
space. The class, one of the largest in the school history,
had an unusually high scholarship average. Many
of the graduates have continued their studies in colleges, nor  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

mal schools and schools of special training. The commercial
department had no difficulty, in spite of labor conditions, in
placing the graduates in business positions, most of them in
our own city.

We are trying to emphasize to pupils the advantages in
remaining in school until graduation. Talks to pupils and
conferences with parents have resulted in number of desirable pupils returning to school after decision had been
made to go to work. The enrollment figures by years will
show decided improvement in the percentage of pupils
completing their course and receiving the school diploma.

My report began with some reference to college preparation and the student enrollment in colleges, and will conclude referring to this subject again, but from different
angle. The State Legislature created special commission
for an investigation relative to the technical and higher
education in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Professor
Stephen L. Colvin of Brown University was retained by the
commission to secure certain information from the senior
classes in the representative high schools of this state. Thirty
high schools were selected, among them being our own. This
special commission is to report to the Legislature whether
or not it would be advisable to establish in Massachusetts a
state university. The survey made of the high schools is to
determine the number of graduates who wish to take college
work, but who, from reasons other than ability, are not able
to enter the private college. On Thursday, December  Professor Andrew H. McPhail, delegated by Professor Colvin,
gave the senior class psychological test similar to the one
which has been for few years given annually to the Brown |
freshmen. The result of this test shows that the seniors’
average compared favorably with the marks received by the
freshmen at Brown. Tests of this kind show that there are
a number of graduates who have the ability, but who have
not taken the exact subjects required to enter the usual ecolREPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
lege courses. Whether the investigation and report of this
commission leads to the establishing of state university or
not, it will, no doubt, have some material effect in modifying
and broadening college entrance requirements.

The death of two of our teachers brought to an end
eareers of long and faithful service in this school. Miss
Margaret E. Dixon directly after her graduation from Smith
College twenty-five years ago began her teaching in the Holyok. High School, and from that time to within few weeks
of her death was loyal and valued member of the High

| School faculty. Miss Dixon was more than teacher of text
books—she took real personal interest in her pupils as
many of them will testify. Mr. Jason T. Draper who had
been Head of the Science Department for twenty-five years,
and who had retired at the close of the school year in June,
died suddenly while on visit with friends in New Jersey less
than week previous to Miss Dixon’s death. Mr. Draper
was an earnest scholar of his subjects and an enthusiastic
teacher. He enjoyed loyalty and devotion from the teachers in his department and from the pupils in his classes. Mr.
Draper’s work in this school is well known in the colleges
where he sent well-prepared so many of the young men who
continued their science study with marked success. The

structure which he built here is sound and lasting.

eports of Supervisors

This part of the volume is devoted to the annual reports
of the principals of the Evening High and Continuation
Schools, and to excerpts from the statements submitted annually in December by the supervisors of special departments
to the Superintendent of Schools. They cover wide range
of subjects and include recommendations worthy of great
consideration. The report of the Supervisor of the newly
organized Evening Practical Arts classes for women is published for the first time, while Mr. Appel has appended financial statements pertaining to the use of the High School
Swimming Pool and Gymnasium by outside classes.

Report of Principal P. J. Garvey of the Evening High
School:

“With the close of the present session in March,  the Holyoke Evening High School will have rounded out eighteen years
of successful work. Starting from very modest beginnings with
limited equipment, this school has grown to such proportions and
accomplished so much that it stands today not only an important
branch of the educational department of this city, but on account of
pioneer work in Vocational and Americanization training, it ranks
among the most progressive evening high schools of the Commonwealth.

“The school term, in keeping with other institutions of its kind,
Was somewhat shortened last vear with better results to attendance
and with no perceptible loss in scholarship. The term as now arranged comprises twenty weeks of three evenings each. The nightly
program calls for two sessions of fifty-five minutes each, with four

minute interval between periods to allow puipls to change classes.
The program of studies furnishes excellent opportunity for working
bovs and girls to obtain instruction in subjects usually taught in
High Schools, and which for one reason or another, they are unable
to pursue as well as to continue study in advanced subjects.

“The Commercial department as usual attracts the largest number of students, undoubtedly because of pupils’ desire for instruction
in subjects which will enable them to increase their earning capacity
with no great loss of time. It must not be understood, however, that
this school is purely business or commercial school. The school
also conducts departments in Mathematics, Modern Languages, Classics, Science, Mechanics, Civil Service and English. Strange to say
during all the yvears of the school’s life there has been no strong
demand for courses in History.

“This year we have conducted some excellent courses in college
preparatory work, and several of our boys expect to take college board
examinations.

“Some idea of the growth of the school may be gained from the
fact that in the first class was graduated. This class was made
up of six boys and two girls, while the class of has membership of about fifty. The graduates of this school are now filling positions of honor and trust in this as well as other communities. Among
our graduates are numbered clergymen, lawyers, physicians and dentists in the professional field as well as mechanical and electrical engineers, chief draftsmen, sales managers and superintendents of manufacturing plants.

“The school as whole is at present pretty well balanced institution. There is need of broadening out the English department so
that the classes in Commercial English may be brought into closer
relationship with the classes in Literature and High School English.
I would recommend that there be sconducted in this department a
course of library instruction, similar to that given by Dean Fay of the
day High School. have no doubt that such course would be of
much practical value to many pupils and am sure that we would
have the hearty cooperation of the librarian and assistants of the
Holyoke Public Library. .

“I hope the time is not far distant when some system of comparative value or evaluation of the work of pupils in Evenrng High School
can be adopted, which will fix definitely in day High School credits,
the value of work completed by evening school pupils who wish to enter advanced classes in the day High School.

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

“I am pleased to note the improvement in the lighting of the
building as result ‘of new fixtures installed, but it doesn’t solve the
problem by any means. Several rooms are still poorly lighted owing
to improper location of outlets. The new fixtures are excellent and
the Board of Public Works has done good work but sooner or later
the building must be re-wired. Let us hope that in the near future
this work will be done.

“A word of commendation is due the janitors for their service during the past year. In addition to their regular duties they policed
the building during school hours, thus reducing disturbance from
outside sources to minimum.

“In these days of generous appropriations for municipal departments, when the tax payer calls for rigid economy and is prone
to criticise extravagance, it is refreshing to note that no word of criticism has yet been offered against the amount of money devoted to
evening school purposes.”

Report of Mr. Jeremiah F. Ganey, Director of the Continuation School:

“The previous reperts have dealt with the development of the
various departments of the Holyoke Continuation School. It has progressed slowly but surely, and thus has been laid firm foundation
for future work. New departments have been added only after
careful consideration with regard to their value in this line of work.

“The Home Repair class, which was first of its kind to be offered

. in the schools of Massachusetts, has proved success and is being
adopted in other cities of the state.

“The reports of home visits handed in by the teachers of this
course clearly show that it has sold itself to the parents, not only
because they heartily approve of the training the boys receive, but
what is more convincing, because of the way in which they have
responded in sending household material for repair.

“The sewing section expanded its scope of work in September
and now has morning classes for dressmaking, composed of those
who have had sewing for one year. As in the sewing classes, the
pupils supply their own material. The shop teacher advises and
discusses cost, style and durability of dress goods. They thus learn
to discriminate and to purchase with an appreciation of the economic
value. The pupil herself goes through the whole process of selecting
her pattern, cutting, fitting and sewing: so that when the dress is
finished she may truly say ‘I made that dress myself.’



REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

“Of course the school does not consider its work done when it teaches

the pupil. It is ever reaching out to be of service to the family and
to the community. ‘os

“I have often had this reply to questions asked me concerning
continuation school work. ‘What! pupil comes only four hours a
week? Is that not waste of time?’ Invariably the questioner has in
mind methods of teaching used in regular schools. Of course it would
be waste of time under such conditions, But continuation school
methods are radically different from those employed in regular schools.
‘The work is intensive. When pupil enters the class room for the first
time, the teacher finds out the needs of the child and from that
time on gives to the pupil all he can absorb. One thing must be borne
in mind, the work is based upon teaching the individual rather than
the group or unit.

“Most of the pupils in continuation schools are those who went
to work because they preferred the latter to school. As these pupils
have left school at very critical period in their educational lives,
it is the aim and object of the continuation school to keep these
children from forgetting the little they have learned. Therefore, as
has been stated above, entirely different methods are used to interest the pupil. As he does not wish to attend school and hates the
sight of text book, there are no text books used in the school. His
work is given to him on lesson sheets. These sheets carry on the
work which he has been doing in the regular school. His material
is taken from his every day life and co-ordinated shop work. He is
interested in both and is ready to cooperate with his teacher.

“Not only does the school teach, but it also performs broader
service to the community. This service is carried out in various
ways, chiefly through home visits. The teacher, thanks to the cordial
attitude of the parents, comes into intimate relations with them
and is able to help through advice and often in material way, when
necessary, through social service organizations, :

“Every effort is made to interest the pupils in the value that comes
from education and we are pleased to state that many of our pupils
have been enrolled in evening classes.

“When pupils ask for recipes, when mothers seek advice through
their children, when pupil brings money received as presents, in
order that the teacher may go to the bank with the pupil to open up
an account; when the attitude of the pupil unconsciously changes for
the better in personal habits and sph, when these and other things
too numerous to mention occur in the daily life of the school, the value

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOCLS
to the child of this form of education becomes more pronounced as time
goes on.”

Report of Miss Anna Gorman, Supervisor of Evening
Practical Arts Work:

“Education has so changed within the last decade that at present
education through the schools is not limited by age, time of day or
year. All that is necessary is the desire to learn and the willingness
to give up little time to have that desire fulfilled. Evidence of that
willingness is shown in the very interesting evening classes held in our
schools.

“Women, in particular, are anxious to increase their efficiency by
being trained in household and practical arts, that they may all the
better manage their homes in more practical manner.

“To give the women of Holyoke every possible advantage, the
Evening Practical Arts classes were reorganized this year, on stateaided basis. By this, the State has direct supervision over all the
classes. Such supervision would, of necessity, tend to make the

work more thorough and uniform. In return, the State reimburses
the city, thus enabling the city to carry on this very practical work
on larger scale and at minimum cost.

“These classes are open to all women, over sixteen years of age,
who are employed in the home or in occupations outside the home.

“This vear the work started with fifteen classes, but later three

new classes had to be organized to accommodate all who wished to
register. Eighteen classes are now in operation, with an approximate membership of three hundred and fifty women. New classes
will be started at any time, when sufficient number of women signify their desire for this training.

“The Evening Practical Arts classes are held in the various
school centers. Each class meets two nights week. In offering the
work in the different schools, it is possible to reach the greatest

) number of pupils. .

“At present the following classes have been organized:

“The method of instruction is that of the short unit course.
Through this system of instruction, many opportunities are opened.
By them special needs can be directly met. There is the least possible loss of time as each unit is complete in itself, without regard to
what comes before or after. Thus woman who completes one
unit has produced specific article, viz., hat or dress. Not only
has she produced it, but she is capable of making another without help.
“The work in all the classes is so planned that the pupil receives
the greatest possible benefit by actually doing the work and learning
thereby. class in cookery might serve as an example to illustrate
that. All the instruction is given with meal as the project. A
dinner unit may consist of eight class meetings. At each meeting
a dinner is prepared. At the close of the unit, eight dinners have
been planned, prepared and served. And so with each unit, whether
it is the preparation of suppers, breakfasts or luncheons. Special

  REPORT OF THE ?UBLIC SCHOOLS

emphasis is placed on marketing and the preparation of nutritious and
appetizing meals in minimum amount of time and at the least
expenditure of money.

“The schools are well equipped to carry on this very helpful work.
The interest and enthusiasm shown by the women attending the
classes and the desire that is continually being expressed for the formation of new classes, clearly show that the women of Holyoke are
anxious for this form of training.”

Report of Mr. Robert E. Hamill, Supervisor of the Industrial Arts Department:

“The past year has been one of rigid economy in the Industrial
Arts Department. Yet with helpful cooperation within the department, we have been able to readjust our course of study so that no
detrimental effects have been suffered. Our plan called for the revision of our program of expansion in the junior and senior high
school shop equipment. The plans of several years standing for the
development of the junior high school course in Mechanical Drawing
were temporarily laid aside. With the introduction of elementary
problems in electrical work, substitution for the more expensive
woodworking courses was made. The whole scheme was well within
the sound educational practice, as it relates to the Practical Arts of
offering variety of experiences in variety of different materials.
That the new materials were also less expensive has proved to be of
decided advantage under the present circumstances.

“A number of marked improvements have been made in the junior
high school work during the past few years, the benefits of which
are only beginning to be felt at present. These changes given in
the order in which they reflect themselves in improved work are
permanency in the teaching force, revision of the school programs,
relocation and renovation of several school workrooms, and expansion of the course of study. While much remains to be done, reasonable pride may be taken in what has already been accomplished.

“In anticipation of the coming year believe our greatest problem is the development of the senior high school shop courses and
equipment to the standard reached in the junior high schools. The
shop at the high school is being used far beyond its capacity at
present with little prospect for future development. Four different teachers are now using the room for seven or eight classes almost
every school day for total of mere than ten hours. It is obvious
that with such use the equipment is subject to tremendous wear and

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
needs constant care and attention. The old benches and vises have
been rebuilt and replaced; the machinery with the exception of six
wood turning lathes isin excellent shape, It would seem advisable to discard these worn out lathes and replace them with three new machines
each year for the next two years; even three good machines would
be an improvement over six unusable ones.

“Our room is badly in need of thorough renovation. The unsightly stone work below the grade line of the building should be sheathed
and the whole room painted. group of lockers should be provided for
the storing of pupils’ work; indeed with so many pupils’ unfinished
work to take care of we lose too much valuable time when each new
class comes into the room. It would seem that these recommendations which are modest and urgent should be attempted as soon as
possible.

“The building of bird houses for eight weeks in the spring term
by pupils of Junior II proved to be project of considerable public
interest and educational advantage to all of our pupils. Mr. Aaron
Bagg of the Holyoke Bird Club gave an interesting and timely lecture in each school on our local birds and their habits, and illustrated
with slides from the Massachusetts Audubon Society.”

Excerpt from report of Miss Teresa L. Dowd, Supervisor of the Household Arts Department:

“The Practical Arts are now recognized by leading educators as
important subjects in the school curriculum. True, there are some
who place the subjects as secondary to the so-called cultural subjects.
A member of the State Board of Education in talk to the teachers of
the High School made it quite clear that these subjects were as important as others taught in our schools today. So again plead that
these subjects be placed on the required list in our schools.

“In order to carry on the good work started in the Junior High
Schools, the periods in the Senior High School should be doubled. It
is necessary to review work the first four months because so muny
pupils enter from the parochial schools where these subjects are not
taught. It is rather discouraging for these pupils to be in classes
with pupils who have some knowledge of the work. Pupils taking
sewing for the first time should be in class of beginners. The pupils
who have training in cooking and sewing in our schools are of great
help in their homes. Many are able to prepare meals, and in many
eases do all the cooking if called upon. They also help with the sewing for other members of the family. Many girls in the High School

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHGGILS
have, during the last year, made garments for their mothers and
sisters. ,

“Regular courses in millinery, laundry and home nursing should

be added to our course.”
Exeerpt from report of Miss Grace D. Lynn, Art
Supervisor :

“The enrollment in the art classes of the High School, though
somewhat larger than last vear, still continues to be small. This is
to be regretted as the studio is well equipped and affords accommodations for many more pupils.

“During November poster contest open to high school students
was conducted by the Holyoke Community Federation, and thirty :
posters were submitted. These were very favorably commented on
by the committee in charge. The spirit in which the work was done |
shows that the pupils are ready in an emergency to prove the value
of the art work.

“The small enrollment in the High School is traced to the still
smaller enrollment in Junior II and III grades of the junior high
schools, The work is optional here, but the pupils desiring to elect it
find it impossible to do so, owing to the pressure of other work. There
are no art classes whatever in Junior III, and only small groups in
Junior IT. All pupils in Junior have an hour each week assigned to
them, and some very good work has been done.

“In an attempt to strengthen the work in these grades committee of six teachers was appointed by the Superintendent last
spring. This was composed of representative from each of the
junior high schools, and myself as chairman. Its object was to
arrange new art outline in some definite form for these grades. This
was completed in June and approved by the Superintendent. It is
now in use a.nd has been found to be very helpful to the grade teachers
conducting lessons between my visits. It is hoped that we may soon
have an illustrated outline exhibited in these schools.

“Conditions in the elementary grades are more normal. satisfactory amount of time is given, and the results compare favorably
With those of other cities. Some of the elementary school principals
have displayed samples of work done each week. These are exhibited in the main corridors where the teachers and pupils can readily see

them. Their interest and enthusiasm is sure to produce better results.

“Since the last outline was printed, many new teachers have been
appointed, and in order to make their work clearer to them, the superREPORT OF TLIE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
visors are meeting regularly to revise the outline for these grades.
We hope to present this before long.”

Part of the report of Mr. Hugh Craig, Musie Supervisor, is as follows:

“The primary schools have been almost wholly equipped with
the Hollis Dann Music Books, and they are very much liked by teachers and  pupils. The exercises and songs in them are very
artistic and give much enjoyment. We are also using the ‘sight
reading exercises’ which develop reading ability which cannot be
attained in any other way.

“Orchestras have been organized in several of the schools, and
are creating real love for music.

“In the junior high school the class work is improving under the
new program of studies. These schools, too, have been equipped with
Hollis Dann Junior Song Books. This book being entirely new to the
pupils, it is developing interest and enthusiasm. Orchestras, too,
form considerable part of the extra curricula activities. They
are especially utilized at the assemblies and other special occasions.
All of the graduation exercises had special musical numbers on the
programs.

“In the High School we have two choruses which meet once a
week, studying some of the choral works of the great masters as a
part of our work in Music Appreciation. There are in the choruses
about two hundred seventy-five pupils who elect music. In February
we arranged chorus and produced the opera entitled ‘The Nautical
Knot,’ by Herbert, which was successfully given. The soloists were
all pupils of the school. About one hundred dollars was realized and
given to the Piano Fund.”

The following report was submitted by the Medieal Director, Dr. Wilfrid M. St. Georges: .

“The following is the report of the Medical Division of the Department of Hygiene for the year  Since the last report, physical
examinations of students of the public and parochial high schools :

home to the parents telling them of the conditions found, such as enlarged or diseased tonsils, bad teeth, etc., and advising them to consult their family physician or dentist.

“There have been examinations of children during the year
between the ages of and  who applied for employment certificates; two were rejected for not being up to the physical standard and
advised to secure outdoor work.

“The number of children excluded during the year for evidence of disease is as follows: Scabies,  Impetigo,  Chicken Pox,
 Sore Throat,  Vomiting in School,  Mumps,  Grippe,  Pain
in side,  Swollen Gland,  Dog bite,  Rash on body,  Peeling of hands,  Measles,  Pediculosis,  Poison Ivy,  Ringworm,
 Headache,  Cough,  Skin disease,  Whooping Cough,  Tonsilitis,  Otitis Media,  St. Vitus Dance,  Suspected Diphtheria,  ;
Accident,  

“There have been vaccinations during the past year in the
schools. Of this large number no cases of infection were seen or
reported. Since the opening of school September cases of
diphtheria have been reported by the Board of Health. Of this
number fifty-five have been children of school age between five and
twelve years. The cases were spread throughout the city and not
confined to any one locality. We have made special inspection of
each case and have examined the throats of children in the classrooms. In the West Holyoke School twenty-five swabs were taken
to find out if there might be carrier who was spreading the disease;
ten swabs were taken in other schools. The Board of Health reported
all swabs as negative. .

“The work of the two school nurses must be noted as they assist
the physicians in physical examinations, vaccinations, and school clinics. Then comes follow-up work in the cases of defective children
through visits to the homes, where much can be done in advising the
mother of the immediate need of medical, dental or other special attention. Home conditions are also noted, and when family is un; ahle to provide for the correction of these defects, the nurses secure
relief through our local agencies. During the vear children were
found to have defective vision; of these were quite serious cases.
A home visit in each case resulted in children having eyes examined and glasses properly fitted. Again surprisingly large number of mal-nourished children have been found and special. diet advised, and the drinking of milk encouraged,

“Weighing and measuring is an important factor in gauging the
health of the school child. and we hope for further assistance in this

“During the past vear home visits were made by the school
nurses.

“There have been placed in every school building bandages, adhesive plaster, iodine, lIvsol, vaseline, ete. for emergency use. would
recommend that medicine cabinet be placed in every school building,
and suggest that they be made by the boys in the Manual Training
Department.”

Report of Mr. Louis K. Appel, Director of Physical Edueation in Grades:
\
“The work in Physical Education and Hygiene is steadily pro, gressing. During the past year more attention has been given to the
study of Hygiene. Courses of study have been worked out and put
in operation.

“In the primary grades and Junior and II, instruction is given
by the classroom teacher. The course of study, while complete, allows
sufficient flexibility for the teacher to introduce and to stress particujar phases of the health work. In Junior III the Director conducts
the lectures and discussions. The latter are particularly valuable
because they help to clarify the students’ impressions of the construction and functioning of the human organism. Besides, they serve as
a guide to direct the alteration of lecture course which can never
be finished product, for facts that we believe to be unimportant may
be vital for the students’ perception of the subject and vice versa.

“Perhaps the most striking feature of the Hygiene work is its incorporation in the school program, that is, it now receives time in
the schedule just as any other subject, whereas formerly, though not
neglected, it had to be injected wherever the program would permit it.

“The Physical Education work is well established. Each teacher,
is well fitted for the particular classes under her supervision. The
grade teachers, aided by the special teachers, have become more proficient in teaching the free-exercises, games and dances.

“Owing to seasonal conditions last year, more attention was given
to the outdoor work. Children like to run races, jump, and play the
many running games which are an impossibility indoors. For classroom work we shall always have to rely upon the calisthenics, march  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
ing. folk-dancing, and games which provide movement without much
running.

“In the Junior High Schools the director, conducts the work in |
the auditoriums which serve as gymnasia. With the addition of music wherever possible, the work has an added attraction that at once
appeals to the pupils. Free exercises, folk dances, athletics and games
comprise the essential activities. sample of the type of work
which has been going on in the auditorium was recently given at the
Springfield convention and was well received. The ‘two minute
drills’ between classes provide relaxation from the mental strain.
The pupil class leaders for the most part are able to give the exercises so that they are done with zest and vigor. With program
such as ours, drills of this type are necessary because passing from
one room to another does not provide sufficient exercise for the big
muscles of the body, which at the adolescent age we cannot well afford to neglect,

“The Physical Efficiency Test: Dash, standing broad jump, chinning for the boys, and knee raising for the girls, continue to be the
most popular in the athletic program because it involves every pupil
from the fifth grade up. Each pupil does his best because he knows
that passing the test contributes to the standing of the school. More
than ever, the participation of the masses rather than that of few
stars is being stressed. The results of the test are as follow:

Junior High School Girls: Metealf, per cent; Lawrence,  
per cent; Highland, per cent; Morgan, per cent; West,  
per cent.

Junior High School Boys: Metcalf, per cent; Highland,  
per cent; Lawrence, per cent: Morgan, per cent; West  
per cent.

Primary Girls: Ingleside, per cent; Springdale, per cent;

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

“The eighth annual field meet at Prospect and Hampden playgrounds was the most successful in our experience. Thanks to the
high school girls’ and boys’ track teams, we had plenty of capable
Officials. Since only participants in the primary schools were excused
to attend the meet, much of the delay formerly caused by children
romping all over the field was eliminated. The Morgan School won
the boys’ meet, and the Metcalf School the girls’ meet. The Metcalf School won both the boys’ and girls’ relay races; and the Elm
St. School won both the boys’ and girls’ primary school] relay races.

“The athletic teams in the junior high schools were more evenly
balanced than usual, resulting in keener competition. ‘Tom’ Finn,
whose rich experience as referee and umpire and whose innate understunding of boys combines both the essentials for the proper conducting of inter-school sports, deserves recognition for the success of the
leagues, School standings were as follows:

Basketball: Metcalf, Morgan, Lawrence, West and Highland.

Baseball: Morgan, Metcalf, Highland, West and Lawrence.

Soccer: Metcalf, Morgan, Highland, West and Lawrence.

This was our initial attempt at basketball league. Thanks to the
Boys’ Club, we were able to secure suitable floor. Basketball for
junior high school boys was immensely popular. The playing-off
of the Metcalf-Morgan tie for the championship at the High School
Gymnasium, with over thousand rooters present, shows itself in
no unmistakable language.

“Saturday morning classes for the Junior High School pupils afford chance for those who desire extra school activities. Besides
the gymnasium work, these classes provide the pupils with chance 
to learn to swim or to perfect their strokes and dives. At the end
of the year swimming meets are held. The Lawrence School won
both meets.

“Classes in Physical Education for evening students, both High and
Vocational, were conducted as in former years. Miss Septa Lynn
had charge of the ladies, about thirty-five in number. Mr. Dawson
and Mr. E. Franceur gave instruction to over eighty men. The
Evening High School organized basketball team which made creditable showing and which served to strengthen school spirit among

the pool as much as in former years.

“Vacation classes for boys and girls were again offered this sum. mer. Approximately twelve hundred boys used the pool twice weekly
and six hundred girls used it weekly. Due to the fact that all girls

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

Mr. John P. Whalen, High School Boys’ Physical Director, writes as follows:

“The work in the Physical Education Department of the High
School was carried on along the familiar lines, i, e., marching, calesthenics, apparatus work, gumes, athletics and aquatics.

“Upon entering school, each pupil is examined by the school physician. Every pupil, unless excused upon the presentation of medieal certificate, is required to report for gymnasium work twice a
week, one period each week being devoted to aquatics. The percentage of those excused is very low.

“Many more boys have reported for the various athletic teams
this year, and during the year our basketball team won the New YorkNew England Championship at Glen Falls, N. Y., and one aquatic team won the Intercholastic Swimming Meet at Troy, N. Y. Scholastic
rules are strictly adhered to in the make-up of these teams. Selfcontrol and fairness are the elements drilled into candidates along
with team play and individual skill. Throughout the year inter-class
games and athletic meets in the various sports are held. These create
a@ lot of interest and afford an opportunity to the boys who cannot
play with the representative teams.”

Miss Septa Lynn, Director of High School Physical Education among the girls, has the following to report:

“The enrollment in Physical Education classes for girls in the
High School on December was four hundred fifteen, an increase
over last year. In few instances, girls have been excused from the
work,

“The time allowed for the course in Physical Education is two
periods weekly, varying from forty-four to fifty-four minutes each.
With the majority of pupils this means that one period is devoted to
aquatics, another to work in the gymnasium. There are at pre ent
eighteen gymnasium and fourteen swimming classes in the school
schedule.

“The course in swimming includes instruction in Red Cross life
saving methods, and the giving of these tests has been continued with
gz results. We have splendid well-cared for pool, but believe
it will not produce maximum results for all our girls until longer
period is provided. It is difficult problem in school the size of
Holyoke High to arrange all class schedules to the best advantage.
A longer period here seems most urgent if this subject is to remain an

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
important one in the curriculum. More time is required for thorough hair drying. Many family physicians advise the discontinuance of swimming for their patients, numerous parents request it—
due in many cases to susceptibility to colds, ear and throat conditions.

“At present seventy-three girls are excused from work in the pool
and report twice weekly to the gymnasium. In three cases, family
physicians have advised no gymnasium work, permitting patients to report to the pool twice weekly.

“In the gymnasium classes, the thought that Physical Education is
not necessarily physical exercise is emphasized. Pupils are led to see
that Physical Education is supplying the physical need which may
or may not be physical exercise. Dr. Shine has aided materially in
emphasizing the necessity of personal hygiene, good posture and carriage, and in stressing the broader objectives of Physical Education
in morals, manners and health.

“Afternoon activities are special feature of our work. During
the year inter-class swimming and track meets, basketball, tennis,
and volley ball tournaments have been conducted, as well as practice
in apparatus work, indoor baseball and life-saving methods.

“The most recent development in this department is the organization of High School Girl Scout Troop with the physical director
as captain. Miss Marion Wetherell, local Girl Scout Director, is gupervising the work. Much interest is shown in the weekly meetings. The
troop consists of three patrols at present.”

Mr. Edouard Cadieux, Schoolhouse Agent, has submitted
the following statement:

“Besides the usual daily work and ordinary repairs, many extraordinary repairs were made in the various schools during the past
year, especially during the summer months. These consisted mostly
in repairing old broken down furniture.

“At the Morgan School, six hundred seventy-two desks and chairs
were scraped, shellacked and varnished. Some of these were so badly
cut that the tops had to be removed and new ones substituted. Many
broken castings hud to be replaced also, and now the furniture in that
building is in satisfactory condition. |

“At the Sargeant St. School, the furniture in Grade was treated in the same manner as was the furniture in Grades and in the
West Street School.

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
“Owing in to the great amount of repair work done at the |
High School, there was not great deal to be done in this school this
year. The furniture in one room, however, had to be repaired.
. “With the aid of the pupils in the Repair Class of the Continuation School, many desks and chairs that were cast aside several years
ago were put in condition and one set was put in use at the Highland
School. By putting this old furniture in use again, at least twelve
hundred dollars was saved.
“At the So. Chestnut St. School the furniture in one class was repaired and refinished, while at the Kirtland School the furniture in
practically the whole building was repaired and refinished, so that now .
the building has nice neat appearance,
“The opening of the new portable schools has meant great deal
of readjustment in the Wm. Whiting, Lawrence and So. Chestnut St.
Schools. In the Wm. Whiting School the furniture in eight rooms
had to be taken up and reset by direction of the Superintendent. At
the Lawrence School the furniture in the new rooms and in rooms on
the second floor was renewed. In the rest of the building the furniture was repaired and refinished. Two sets of furniture that were
used in the High School for the So. Chestnut St. School pupils were
moved from the High School and placed in the So. Chestnut St.
portable school. |
“Much of the furniture that has been taken out of the different
schools, too far gone to be repaired, has been replaced by old broken |
down furniture that was found in the attics and basements of various
schools and repaired and refinished so that it can be used for some
time yet. ;
“The following recommendations are submitted for your consideration:
“The opening of the new portable schools has meant great deal
used with old desks that were repaired during the summer.
All the furniture in the Nonotuck St. School needs to be refinished.
At the Wm. Whiting, So. Chestnut and Hamilton St. Schools, much
of the furniture needs to be repaired and refinished, and at the Hamilton St. School fifty large chairs are needed to replace broken ones.
At the Elmwood School few of the rooms need to be repaired and
some furniture reset.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
At the Lawrence School, with the exception of one or two rooms,
the furniture is very old and poor and cannot last much longer. This
is also true of the teachers’ desks.
“I mention only the buildings where the need is urgent. It is
imperative that new chairs be provided, otherwise temporary seats
will have to be made.”

Report of the Board of
| Trustees
To His Honor, the Mayor, the Board of Aldermen, the School

Committee, and the Citizens of Holyoke:

The Board of Trustees for Vocational Edueation §respectfully submits the minth annual report covering the
vear  ,

Qn September Ist the Board opened two new courses
(using empty rooms in the East Dwight Street Building for
the purpose) to teach Electrical Theory and Practice and
Sheet Metal Drafting and Practice. The need for these
classes has been acknowledged for long time by all familiar
with the statistics relating to the labor supply in the country,
and it is hoped that the boys and their advisors will realize
the value of these new opportunities presented.

The Board has had in mind the need for instruction in
Holvoke along these lines for several vears, but has deferred
action hoping to be able to make thoroughly adequate provision for the pupils from the start in new building and
with proper equipment. However, the need seemed so urrent that, despite the fact that only very modest beginning
was possible, it was decided to take the initial step toward
the long delaved expansion of this work. The Trustees feel
themselves to have been most fortunate in being able to secure

  REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL .
the services of two men, both experts in their lines, to lay 
the foundations for the new classes.

Mr. Alfred J. Crockford, who teaches Electrical Theory
and Practice, has recently returned from Peking, China,
where he was for four years in charge of the electrical work
on the great hospital unit erected there by the Rockefeller
Foundation.

Mr. William E. Casey, who has charge of Sheet Metal
Drafting and Practice, is graduate of the Boston Latin
School, who has been engaged in the Sheet Metal Industry
continuously since  and has held several positions of
responsibility prior to coming here.

Mr. Ernest W. Stacey, formerly with the Fore River

Ship Building Company, was engaged September Ist to teach
Drafting and Related Machine Shop Subjects at the East
Dwight Street Building to the Rehabilitation Men. Mr.
Stacey’s experience included both drafting room and shop
work, also responsibility for the work of other men in both
departments, and it  unfortunate that we cannot retain his
Services.

Mr. Wyatt E. Harper, who came to us at the beginning
of the vear as an assistant instructor in the Academie Department, is Yale man whose training as teacher has been
secured by service in the New Haven High School, the Boardman Trade School and the Killingly High School at Danielson, Conn., where he was assistant principal. In addition |
to his work in the class room Mr. Harper has charge of the
athleties.

A elass for training Auto Mechanics should be provided !
for during the coming year. The condition of this great
industry, because of its lack of trained men, is truly lamentable, and it presents today one of the greatest fields of opportunity to the young man who must become wage earner ,
early in life.

REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL  

During the war, because of the Board’s desire to keep
expenditures at minimum despite the multitudinous tasks
which war conditions entailed, the house building program

- was allowed to drop out of sight.‘ This branch of activity
should be resumed during the year so that our Carpentry students can get real construction experience. A
lot should be secured by the city and sufficient money appropriated for the purchase of materials and payment of the
various minor contracts which must be sublet. It probably
will not be advisable to attempt so ambitious project as
House No.  five or six room cottage, rather than ten
room house, should be the objective.

From the beginning of Vocational Education in this
Commonwealth the necessity of giving some teacher-training to the men who were to be used as instructors was recognized as thing of vital importance. For several years the
State has maintained classes for this purpose in different citles, and this year the Trustees were able to bring about the |
transfer to Holyoke of the class heretofore meeting in Springfield. total of twenty-five men registered and of that
number fifteen duly qualified under the examinations and
are still members of the class. Students are in attendance
from Springfield, Westfield, Chicopee, Northampton and
Holyoke. It is to be regretted that more men from this city
did not avail themselves of this opportunity to prepare themselves for positions as teachers in vocational schools.

The four original departments of our school have been
managed with their usual high standard of efficiency and their
trade products continue to show the skilled craftsmanship
which has given this institution its present standing.

Three years of continuous twelve month employment of
machinery and instructors is, however, beginning to leave its
mark and it may be advisable this year to discontinue all
summer school activities in order that the shop equipment

  REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL
may undergo the thorough overhauling that can only be
given with the school at standstill.

Sinee the establishment of the school there have been
practically no replacements of tools and machinery. Students’ use is notoriously hard on machine tools of all kinds, and
almost as trying on hand tools. There should be this year a
complete refitting of all departments on all small tools and a
start made toward replacement of such machines as need it
the most. Certain lathes in our Machine Shop have been
for three years practically useless on any job where reasonably close following of dimensions was required. Much of
the type in the Print Shop is in unsatisfactory condition and
the same is true of the tools in the Carpenter Shop. The
Electrical Department needs certain laboratory equipment in
order that scientific principles may be demonstrated on
which it would not be practical to give instruction in any
other way.

The work of the Rehabilitation Division is gradually lessening in extent as more and more of the men pass out into
regular employment. Another school year will probably end
that particular chapter for us, but those who know most about
it are aware that the Ilolvoke Vocational School has made for
our city in this particular matter highly creditable contribution toward most worthy cause.

The Trade Extension Classes show slightly decreased
enrolment partly due to business conditions and in pari te
the fact that the generally crowded condition of the Holyoke
echools has made it necessary for other educational nits tc
take from us rooms in the Iligh School basement devoted to
this work for several vears. Though unavoidable, this is
most unfortunate for its means denying the man who went
to work early in life the opportunity of correcting to some
degree at least the defects in his training and to considerable extent lessens his opportunity for advancement.

REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL  

The Practical Arts work, under the efficient supervision
of Mrs. Margaret A. Carlon, is living up to its always high
ideals and has shown surprisingly small shrinkage in enrolment considering the duplication of its work by the evening
classes of the regular school system. .

We feel it again necessary to call the attention of the
city to certain facts in connection with the consideration of

“a new building for Voeational Education. The present
quarters were admittedly inadequate when built and were
accepted by the State at that time only under definite
promise from our representatives that new home would be
provided for the school in three years. While the State
Department of Education has been very patient, it  well to
remember that three years have passed since our attention
was called by it to our failure to keep this agreement. Last
year the Advisory Committee, named by the Chamber of
Commerce at the Mayor’s request, reeommended that the proposed school building program begin with new Vocational
School. Any business man will agree with us that better
supervision and more economic handling of any plant results from concentration, and because we want to obtain the
best results for Holvoke, we again ask that quarters be provided where all the Vocational activities of the City may
be brought under one roof. The facts that needed classes
are not being started, that old established classes have had to
be discontinued, and that the work today is being earried on
in widely separated buildings, are all the arguments nec essary.

Because this year’s returns as related to the Board’s expenditures apparently set new high reeord not cnly for
this school but for the State, the Trustees consider it well
at this point to insert table showing the relations between
the moneys expended each vear by them and the moneys
broucht to the city from outside sources because of the
school’s activities:

  ......... 
  ......... ,  .........  .  .........  .  .........   .  .........  .  .........  .  .........  .  .........  . 

Even better results would have been attained had the city
seen fit to be more liberal in granting us working capital in
the shape of appropriations. ,

Numerous resignations of efficient teachers during recent years to accept more remunerative employment show —
plainly that the policy of retrenchment adopted by the city
is gradually effecting the efficiency of the school and seriously
interfering with the development in aid of those who wish
to enter the trades. This Board cannot retain the services
of its teachers at salaries materially lower than those paid
in the industries for men of equal ability.

This year has seen several changes in the faculty of the
day school. Three teachers, Mr. Merle E. Sellew of the
Academic Department, Mr. John T. Mendenhall of the Machine Shop, and Mr. James H. Boles, who taught Drafting to
the ex-service men, resigned at the end of the school year to
take positions elsewhere, and in the present month Mr. Ernest
W. Stacey, who sucded Mr. Boles at East Dwight Street,
has also resigned to return to the industry.

The statistics for the year will be found in the report

made to the committee by both parties are on file in this
office.

This investigation was brought about by the objection
of the Department to allowing further franchises to the Holvoke Water Power Company. The Holvoke Water Power
Company had pending at this the, petition for permission
to lav conduits and wires underground in Appleton Street,

REPORT OF GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT  
between Canal Street and Creseent Street. That petition
did not meet with approval in the Board of Aldermen.

The Committee of the Chamber of Commerce has had
several hearings but has not as yet filed its report.

GAS WORKS

Qn October  the following sehedule of gas rates

went into effect: ,
For the first cu. ft. per month........$  per M
For the next eu. ft. per month.......... per M
For the next eu ft. per month........ per M
lor all over cu. ft. per month........ per MM

Discount of eents per thousand on bills paid within
  days of date rendered.

The above rate supercedes the service charge plus the
charge of  thousand cubue feet of gas used, which
charge had been in effect for period of just one vear. The
Service charge plus the cost of produetion distributes the
cost of manufacture, distribution and overhead more evenly
among the consumers than any flat rate that might be adopted, and is in general way more satisfactory to the greater
number of was users. [t has its disadvantages, however, and
the prineipal disadvantage that this department experienced
was in collecting the service charge from prepayment meters
used but little in some seasons and not at all durine other
seasons. Another objection was that people refused to pay
for service charge on the ground that they had not occupied
the premises where the meter was located during the previous
month and the persons who did oceupy it eould not be found.

The gas sent out during the year amounted to more than
  the greatest amount ever sent out in anv one
year.

  REPORT OF GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT
ELECTRIC STATION

The electricity generated at the electric station last year
exceded all previous records, amounting to kilowatts, an Increase of nearly over the amount generated
in  The increase in the number of’ meters set was  ,
or about over the total number set and in use up to
November .

The two new Edge Moor boilers and Westinghouse stokers have been in operation little over one year and have
made marvellous decrease in the cost of coal used per kilowatt. From the records of the electric station it  evident
that the boilers have proven to be good investment.

Since the installation of these boilers the amount of
electricity generated has increased about  with the use
of about the same amount of coal. In  tons of
coal were used in the old boilers from which was generated
  kilowatts. In  tons of coal were used
in the remaining old boilers and the new boilers recently installed from which were generated kilowatts. In
  kilowatts per ton were generated while in kilowatts were generated,.an increase of  .

RECOMMENDATIONS |

There are at the station today, Babeock Wileox
boilers of Hl. P. each which were installed in  provided with Murphy stokers and the two Edge Moor boilers of
  H. P. each provided with Westinghouse stokers, installed in  At least four of the oldest boilers should be
replaced with two new boilers of larger capacity during the
coming Vvear,

The electric generators or turbines at the plant comprise
one K. W. Westinghouse turbine, one K. W. G. E.
turbine installed both in  one K. W. vertical G. E.
turbine installed in and one K. W. vertical G. E.

REPORT OF GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT  
turbine installed in  In addition to these there are
two K. W. units installed in on the hydro-electric
svstem. The K. W. unit installed in should be replaced by larger unit at the earliest possible moment and
the one installed in is fast losing its efficiency and
should also be replaced by one of larger capacity.

If the department is to continue to operate sts present
plant, land should be purchased on the westerly side of the
first level canal and coal pocket erected thereon, from which
a conveyor should be run across the canal to the station. Part
of this land is now leased by the Department from the Hol. yoke Water Power Company, which lease expires March  th
next.

It is apparent from the constantly increasing demands
upon the station that immediate steps must be taken to meet
that demand by installing new boilers, one new turbine, new
switchboard and making other provisions for ample storage
of coal.

While estimates of the work outlined above have not
been fully prepared, it is expected that the improvements
will cost between  and The department has
been considering the necessity for making this investment
for some time, but is still unable to make recommendation
as to Just what should be done to provide for the future demands of the City. First, because it is generally agreed
that it is inadvisable to further increase the capacity of the
present plant because of lack of space on the present site.
Second, because of much larger expenditure that would be
required should it be decided to build an entirely new plant
on some other location where water is always available for
condensing purposes. Third, because of the possibility of
buying power from one source or another, as the demand calls
for it beyond the present capacity of the plant. These
questions are all being considered by the department and it

  REPORT OF GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT
is hoped decision will be made and recommendations submitted at an early date.

The send-out at the Gas Works shows an increase of about
  over the previous year.

The new equipment required at the Gas Works consists
of new station meter, new blower for the water gas set, coke
handling and conveying machinery ete., which will cost approximately .

outside of its road building program was the construction of
a deck steel girder bridge over the Second Level Canal on Lyman Street removal of the stone pier of the Boston Maine
Railroad overhead bridge at Lyman Street; the paving with
treated timber and ereosoted wood blocks of the South Hadley Falls and Willimansett bridges; and the additions to the
Nonotuck Street School and the Tuberculosis Hospital.

taxation amounting to Four Hundred Seventy Thousand Six
Hundred Thirty Dollars ($ ). Additional appropriations were made in the amount of Fifty Three Thousand
Eight Hundred Forty Three Dollars and fifty-two cents
($ ), while supplementary appropriations from taxation were made amounting to Thirty Two Thousand Dollars

Four Thousand Nine Hundred Twenty Three Dollars and
four cents ($ ), making total credit to the departments from all sources for the year of One Million |
Eighty Three Thousand Eight Hundred Ninety Six Dollars
and forty four cents ($ The Department has
transferred from various departments Twenty Nine Thousand
Seven Hundred Thirteen Dollars and eighty-eight cents
($ and has carried forward in balances to the year
| Thirty Four Thousand Eight Hundred Seventy Five
Dollars and eighty-two cents ($ ).

so-called; Rock Valley Road from the Water Works entrance
to the top of the ITairpin Turn, so-ealled, at the high pressure reservoir; Springfield Road from Day Avenue to Ingleside Street; Iligh from Appleton to Cabot.
The prineipal work of the Sewer Department during the
past year has been the construction of the sewer on Hillside
and Concord Avenues to take care of the residents in this
location; and the extention of the Carlton Street storm water
sewer. start was made on the new sewer system tu take
care of the new tract of land which is about to be opened by
the Mt. Tom Realty Trust. Many small additions were made

) REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
to present sewer systems to accommodate new property, and
are located as follows, viz: Bond Street north of Essex
Street; Claremont Avenue east of Hillside Avenue; Concord
Avenue west of Hillside Avenue; Elmwood Avenue east of
Martin Street; Hillside Avenue north of Claremont Avenue;
Hillside Avenue south of Cherry Street; Madison Avenue

Street; Main Strect at the Ingleside School, north of Vernon
Street, and north of Prew Avenue; Morgan Street east of
Northampton Street; Northampton Street south of Madison
Avenue; Wellesley Road north of Stanford Street; Westfield
Road west of Northampton Street.

This Board has always felt great deal of anxiety concerning the safety of the children in the Nonotuck Street
School building, on account of the construction of the main
stairways. After careful examination by the State Department of Public Safety, it was recommended that the
main stairways be discontinued and new stairs be constructed in fireproof stair towers. In accordance with request
from the School Department, this Board had plans and specifications prepared by George P. B. Alderman Company,

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
Architects, to comply with the state requirements. It was
suggested at the time that an inspection of the furnaces
should be made. This was done by Stone-Underhill Heating
and Ventilating Company of Boston, who recommended certain changes which are being made at the present time. While
it is regrettable that the building could not be ready for occupancy during the first school term, nevertheless this board
feels that the benefits to be derived from the remodeled
building will more than offset the inconvenience caused to
both the parents and children in the district. The building
will be equipped with the best exits of any school building
in the city, and upon completion of the alterations to the
- heating plant the fire hazard will be eliminated.
A new addition was constructed at the Tuberculosis Hospital, consisting of six private rooms for patients, including
a bath, and other minor repairs. Until this addition was
built no privacy could be had for the more critical cases at
the hospital. Plans and specifications for this work were
prepared by Architect Oswald Vachon.
Two portable schools were constructed, one on the north
side of the Lawrence and north side of the South Chestnut
Street School to care for the congestion in these districts.
During the past year considerable work was done in all
the public buildings under the jurisdiction of this Board.
In the City Hall, the Mayor’s office and anti-room, the
Board of Aldermen’s chamber, and the City Treasurer’s office were completely renovated by painting throughout and
installing electrical fixtures. new sanitary installation
was made adjoining the City Clerk’s office. The roof and
conductors of the building were repaired.
At the High School new system of lighting was installed, complying with all modern practices. The basement of
the bwlding was completely whitewashed and alterations
were made in the teachers’ diningroom. In the boilers, walls
and fire boxes were relaid.

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  

At the Joseph Metcalf School the hatchway leading to
the basement of the building was enclosed, and extensive repairs made to the roof.

At the Springdale School the Board installed teachers’
rest-room with complete equipment. The roof, gutters and
doors were placed in first-class condition.

At the Sargeant Street School the heating facilities were

increased in two rooms and electrical fixtures were installed.

At the Hamilton Street School the heating facilities
were increased, new floors were laid and the treads on the

To relieve the traffic congestion in the business section

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS |
of the city, the Board during the past year widened the following streets, viz: Chestnut Street east side between Appleton and Dwight Streets Suffolk Streets south side between |
Maple and Chestnut Streets; and Hampden Street between
Pearl and Nonotuck Streets. The Board recommends that
this work be continued and that an appropriation be made to
widen other streets to relieve the ever-increasing traffic congestion.
In the past two years it has been the exeperience of the
Board that the maintaining of macadam and gravel streets
is practically impossible, due to the heavy traffic that they
must sustain, and it is the firm belief of the Board that road
building program extending for period of three years
be planned to do away with streets of non-permanent nature.
The Board recommends that permanent sidewalk be
constructed on the south easterly side of Bh Street from
Sargeant to Northampton Street, and that permanent sidewalk be constructed on west side of Northampton Street
running from the entrance to Mt. Tom Golf Club to Kenilworth Castle, so-called.
The Board believes that an ordinanee should be enacted
whereby all public service connections should be installed on
undeveloped property before any roadway of permanent
nature is constructed. It has been the experience of the
Board in the past that permanent roads constructed by it
have been destroyed, due to the tearing up required in making public service connections after roadway has been
eonstructed, and there is no ordinanee which proteets the
Board in the premises.
The superstructure of both the South Hadley Falls and
Willimansett Brmdges must be painted during the ecoming year. During the course of construction, in the past
year, of pavements on both of these bridges the floor beams
were painted one coat and are in good condition at the present
time.
