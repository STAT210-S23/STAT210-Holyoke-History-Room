Report of the Inspector of lumbing.
To the Board of Health:

GENTLEMEN :—As Inspector of Plumbing, have the
honor of submitting the fifteenth annual report for the fiscal
year ending November .

The following table will show to some extent the amount
and nature of the work:

Water closets put in new buildings,.  
Sinks put in new buildings,   
Baths put in new buildings,.  
Bowls put in new buildings,

Inspections of old and new plumbing,. ....  
Legal notices served to abate nuisances, ..  
Prosecutions,  

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  

All cases have complied with the requirements of the
Board.

-A decrease in new buildings was noticeable throughout
the year, but decided increase in alterations and repairs on
old buildings would indicate that the plumbing business was
fair, and at no particular period of the year was there decided business depression as regards plumbing.

The usual amount of nuisance notices have received the
attention of your inspector, and owing to the new sewers put
in by the Board of Public Works, many sewer connections have
been made and cesspools abolished.

The ‘‘Rules’’ relative to the laying of sewers and drains,
passed by the Board during the month of May, have been enforced by this department with very little criticism and complaint. Owing to our sandy soil and danger from caving, an
average of three inspections have been made for each sewer:
plan filed; all of these are of the character known as ‘‘hurry
ealls,’’? and in many cases the inspector has had to stay on
the job while pipe was laid. It is therefore easy to determine
what the result will be during year when building is good
and many sewer connections are made with the necessary
number of inspections.

In conclusion desire to thank the members of the Board
for their courtesy and co-operation.

Respectfully submitted,
F. L. AVERY,
“Inspector of Plumbing.

Report of Bacteriologist.
To the Board of Health of the City of Holyoke, Mass.:

GENTLEMEN :—I herewith submit report of cases referred
to me during the nine months ending November :

I was appointed by your Board early in March and the
first cases were examined by me March d,  The many advantages of having this work done in local laboratory have
since been demonstrated, the chief one being that swabs may 
now be handed in as late as nine o'clock and be reported the
following morning, whereas formerly unless swab was in be- ,
fore four o’clock it would have to wait over until the following day.

I would recommend that box for swabs be placed in the |
vestibule of the City Hall at the High street entrance. This

- would be of great convenience to the physicians and furthermore,—the swabs would always be deposited in ene place
whereas they are now left at the Board of Health office until
five o’clock and after that at Ball’s Drug Store.

The number of examinations during this time has far exded that of any period of similar length in the past, or, in
fact, that of any full year. The total examinations being
  as against for the full year of  In measure this
is due to the fact that the months of June, October and November showed an unusually large number of new cases, but
what particularly served to cause the pronounced increase in
the total number of examinations was the ruling of your
Board in June to the effect that two consecutive releases would
be required from each ease of diphtheria. Although the later
procedure was the intention of the Board when it first adopted
laboratory methods some eight vears ago, the plan has not been

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.

. earried out for some years past. The efficiency of this plan
has been amply demonstrated since its adoption in June by the
fact that there have been in six months nineteen instances when
a case has shown positive release culture after once having
been found negative. This result may be due to one of several
causes,—the swab reported negative may have been taken soon
after the local application of an antiseptic solution, or in an
instance when there is more than one ease in family, the
throat at the time of taking the first swab may have been clear
of organisms, whereas during the time intervening between
this and the taking of the second, the bacilli may have been
transmitted from the other patient. This as cause may seem
far-fetched, but to my mind it is not at all improbable when
one stops to consider that bacilli may be found in, the throats

“ of persons who, while themselves showing absolutely no symptoms of this disease, have been exposed in some manner, as in
the case of nurse or other attendant. Again, some of the
physicians take release swab just as socn as the membrane

. clears up which may be in some cases in three or four days.
This should not be done and in mest cities such swab would
not be accepted at the laboratory. would suggest that a.
rule be adopted to the effect that release swabs will not be accepted until at least ten days after the case has been reported
positive. In Springfield the time is set at fifteen days and
there is talk of increasing this to twenty.

Although the matter has been menticned frequently in
the past, again call attention to the fact that single negative repcrt from the labcratory shculd never be accepted as
vonelusive in cases which clinically appear positive or even
suspicious. Not infrequently it is possible to make unqualified
diagncsis on single swab, owing to the fact that the morphology of the Klebs Loeffler bacillus may be extremely variable and may approach form which bears striking resemblance to the so-called pseudo diphtheria bacillus. Again,
there may have been some slight misstep in the taking of the
swab or in inceulating the media, and for this reason inREPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
variably request confirmatory swab when the attending physician hands in clinical diagnosis of diphtheria, and the or: ganisms are not found in the laboratory.

All cases of membranous croup should be reported regardless of the laboratory findings.

TUBERCULOSIS.

The number of specimens of sputum sent in to the laboratory was almost twice that of last year when this branch
of the work was first undertaken by your Board.

It is still small, but the members of the profession are
daily realizing more and more the importance of this aid to
diagncsis. Further, some of the local physicians are not aware
of the fact that your Board causes these examinations to be
made free of cost.

TYPHOID. }

Only ten blood specimens were submitted to me for examination during the past nine months, and of these none showed
a positive Widal test.

REPORT OF THE
Inspector of Milk, Vinegar and Petroleum.
| OFFICE OF INSPECTOR, |
City Hauu, Hotyoxe, Mass.,  .
To the Honorable, the Mayor, and Board of Aldermen:

I have the honor to submit the following report as Inspector of Milk, Vinegar and Petroleum for the City of
Holyoke for the year ending November :

MILK.
Total number of licenses granted,  
Total number granted to peddlers, d
Number granted to stores and stands, we  
Number granted for the sale of oleomargarine,  
I have paid into the City Treasurer as fees received, 
Money received for distilled water,  
Number of quarts of sweet milk sold in the city daily is  
Number of quarts of skimmed milk sold daily is,  
Number of quarts of cream sold daily is,  

Making the total number of quarts of sweet milk  of skimmed milk  and of cream  sold in
the past year, which at the retail value of milk and cream as
solé in this city amounts to .

Number of milk samples tested, 
Number of butter samples tested, ..  
Number of vinegar samples tested, ..  
Number of kerosene oil samples tested,  
Number of warnings sent, milk, 
Number of warnings sent, wooden plugs, ..  

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
Your Inspector has sent out only thirty-eight warnings
for milk below the standard, and has found it necessary to
prosecute in three cases. These prosecutions were of store |
keepers for selling milk of not standard quality, and fines of |
$  were imposed in each ease. !
When the fact is taken into consideration that |
samples of milk have been tested, the above results are most |
satisfactory.
Warnings have been sent out to two peddlers for viola- |
tion of rules regarding wooden plugs used on milk cans. As the |
use of these plugs have been discontinued and were all that
have been found, we can safely say that no wooden plugs are
used in the city at the present time.
Carts and other vehicles used for the transportation of
milk are in better condition now than during the preceding |
year. The proposed rules of the Board of Health regulating
the sale of milk, will, when they go into effect, remedy conditions and make it compulsory for some of the dealers to
make improvements or stop the sale of milk. Conditions as
regards the handling of milk in stores show improvement,
and the proposed rules will make it possible for your Inspector to compel all stores to handle milk in sanitary and
hygienic manner, and will also apply to the producers and |
dairy farms.
 Owing to the advance in the price, less milk has been |
used during the year, but an increase has been noted in the |
sale of skimmed milk and cream. |
By act of legislation, June the following stand- |
ards were established :
Milk not less than twelve to fifteen per cent solids. ,
Milk not less than three to thirty-five per cent fat.
Cream not less than fifteen per cent fat.
VINEGAR.
There have been fifty-six samples of vinegar tested and |
same were found up to the standard. few samples were |

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
found below the standard, but these were cases where the
parties were desirous of finding out if their vinegar was
right to sell.

. OLEOMARGARINE. ;

That oleomargarine is being more generally used in
Holyoke is evidenced by the fact that thirty-eight licenses
have been issued to stores for the sale of same and one issued
to peddler. Several samples of oleomargarine have been
brought in by persons who claim they bought it for butter.
In every case but one the samples proved to be oleo or renovated butter, but as the parties refused to prosecute, your inspector was helpless.

PETROLEUM.

Fifty-eight tank cars of kerosene oil have been tested
and all samples were found above the state standard.

During the year, kerosene oil has been brought into Holyoke and sold without being tested by the local Inspector. ,
As said oil  supposed to be tested in some other part of the
state, assume no responsibility for it.

ErrATUM.—Owing to mistake the City Treasurer has
been overpaid fifty cents and the receipts should read, .

I have had great assistance from the Health Officer and
the Board of Health, also my Collector of Samples.

I thank the City Marshal and Patrolmen for the help
that they have given me. .

Respectfully submitted,
JAMES K. MORRILL,
Inspector of Milk.

| REPORT OF
Board of Public Works.
OFFICE OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.
Holyoke, Mass., December .
To the Honorable, the Mayor, and the Members of the Board
of Aldermen of the City of Holyoke, Mass.:
GENTLEMEN :—We beg to invite your consideration to the
twelfth annual report of this department, herewith presented. —
The report covers the fiscal year ending November ,
and the tables annexed hereto show the expenditures in detail
' in each department.

The experimental work which has been done with water
gas tar from the city’s gas plant should, perhaps, receive as
much consideration as any work accomplished during the year.
The work of dust prevention on streets, which has been accomplished by the use of this material on the Springfield road,
is familiar to most of our citizens. The experiment has proven
successful in our opinion. It was accomplished through the
kindness of Manager Snow of the Gas and Electric Department, who furnished the water gas tar without cost to this
board.

It is also much more economical and satisfactory to use
as dust layer than any of the cheaper products with which |
this board is acquainted and we do not say this in disparagement of Tarvia B, which has been used to some extent on
Northampton street. It is the intention of the board the com- |
ing summer to extend the use of water gas tar on all of the
streets where practicable, as by so doing we hope that the

  REPORT OF BOARD GF PUBLIC WORKS.
expense in the street watering department will be lessened and
the comfort and health of our citizens increased.

| The Board has continued the use of tar the past year in
the construction of its macadam roadways with much more
satisfactory results than obtained in the experimental work
begun in  .

Lincoln street, from Pearl street to Northampton street;
Suffolk street, from Walnut street to Oak street; Pine street,
from Suffolk street to Lyman street East Dwight street, from
Bridge street to Bowers street; West street, from East Dwight
street to Pequot street; Commercial street, from Cabot street
to Sargeant street, and Brown avenue, from South street to
Laurel street have been covered with this material. There is
a total in this work of thirty thousand, four hundred and
seventeen square yards.

The roadways of Suffolk street, between Chestnut and
Walnut streets; Mosher street, between Center and Bowers
streets, and Chapin Square have been resurfaced with the tar 
preparation and in this work there are some four thousand,
nine hundred and fifty square yards.

During the coming year it will be necessary to repair and
repaint the South Hadley Falls bridge and to thoroughly
repair.and strengthen the Dwight street foot bridge.

The Board recommends that new bridge be placed
across the first level canal on Sargeant street.

- Some work yet remains to be done in the completion of
the separation of grades on Jackson street, such as paving the
roadway, concreting sidewalks and other minor work.

As has already become matter of public knowledge, it
is hoped to begin the work of widening and improving the
Ingleside underpass early in the coming season.

The Board has had many requests for curbing and side-  
walks in the past which it has not been able to grant on
account of insufficient appropriations. We would recommend
that special loan be made in an amount sufficient to supply
curbing and sidewalks to all abutting property owners who

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS. 
may apply for the same. It is of importance also that attention be given to streets where the grade is such as to cause the
washing of the roadways, that curbing be set and gutters
paved, as by so doing, material saving can be made both in
the care of streets and in the cleaning of catch basins and
sewers. One-half of the cost of the work of constructing sidewalks and laying curbing reverts back to the city upon assessments levied therefor.

The usual amount of maintenance work must be accomplished during the year  the cost of this work increasing rapidly from year to year as the city grows.

The total expenditures in all departments, not including
transfers made from various departments to the general transfer account, amounted to three hundred and forty-seven
thousand, seven hundred and gseventy-nine dollars and fortythree cents ($ ). balance has been carried forward

to the year of thirty-two thousand, eight hundred and
one dollars ($ ), the major part of this being in the
account of Jackson street underpass. |

During the fall an appropriation of five thousand dollars ($ for schoolhouse additions was passed by the
Board of Aldermen, but owing to the fact that the School
Committee did not approve the plans for enlarging the Elm
street school building or the site for the proposed addition to
the Ingleside school building, no expenditures have been made
in this department.

The work of enlarging the Highland Engine House has
been completed and the new City Yard building has been
finished. Substantial additions and alterations were made in
the sanitaries of the Appleton, South Chestnut and West Street
school buildings. The Sargeant street school building, the
renovation of which was begun last winter, is now being used
by the School Committee. 

The new Oakdale school building, work on which was
started early in the spring, was finished late in the fiscal vear
and is now ready for occupancy.

; REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS. 

The old Springdale school building, long since abandoned

for school purposes, was disposed of under an order passed by
the Board of Aldermen, the prods of the sale being used in
the repair and care of other public buildings.

The department now has practically equipped City
Stable with the necessary equipment in the City Yard buildings for doing considerable amount of its repair work upon
tools and implements used in the Outdoor Department.

In the Department of Permanent Highways seven thousand one hundred and six dollars shows as a
charge against vitrified brick. These brick were used in  
in paving Appleton, Division and Suffolk streets and were
charged to this work in that year, but the contracting company
furnishing the brick failed to accept payment for the same
until the fiscal year of  |

The work of connecting the Walnut street trunk sewer
with the Front street sewer system was started early in the
summer and diligently prosecuted to completion, so that the
connecting sewer was put into use during the early fall months.
The work cost eleven thousand, three hundred and twentydollars ($ ). ,

The amount of five thousand, one hundred and thirtynine dollars ($ was spent for permanent sidewalk
work and the laying of curbing.

The expense in the Street Watering Department has increased from year to year, it being especially heavy the current season on account of the small rainfall.

An itemized statement of all expense in the various departments is appended. .

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  

The report herewith presented covers period of eleven
months, ending November  the fiscal year of the depart- |
ment having been changed by legislative act to correspond
with that of the other departments of the city.

During eleven months over one and one-third miles of
main pipe have been laid, consisting of four-inch, six-inch,
eight-inch and twelve-inch sizes. The twelve-inch and part of
the eight-inch pipe were laid to replace the small four-inch
main between the almshouse and Mount St. Vineent and between Gilman street and the Whiting Farm, respectively,
thereby increasing the efficiency of the distribution system.
The four-inch pipe between the points named was taken up.
The new gatehouse was built at the easterly end of the rock cut
canal and part of the canal was cleaned out and arched over |
with concrete to prevent it from becoming filled up again. a

An aerating fountain was constructed at the Whiting
street reservoir for the purpose of improving the taste of the
water, particularly at such times as it may become affected by
vegetable or animal organisms. The water after being aerated
by the fountain will flow in an open channel to the lower or
intake reservoir and from there be delivered into the main
pipe leading to the city.

Good results are expected from the aeration of the water |
in this manner, the plan having been recommended by so high

. an authority as Engineer Allen Hazen. Owiny to the low
water in the upper reservoir, the fountain was not put into
operation this year.

Other improvements also were made at the Whiting street
reesrvoir; the shed and barn were moved to position off the water shed, and the roadway changed at the place of their
former location; new iron fence was built along the dam; a
new iron stairway leading to the gate house erected, and a
new roadway from the northerly end of the dam along the
easterly edge of the reservoir has been partly completed. .

Several hundred trees were planted along the road leading to Ashley Pond.

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.

The Board contributed  toward the construction, by
the town of Southampton, of new bridge across the Manhan 
Brook at Fomer reservoir, in order that bridge of sanitary —
type might be built to replace the old wooden bridge at that
point which had become unsafe for travel.

The Fomer reservoir was partly cleaned out, the low
water affording an excellent opportunity to do the work. A
new crib was constructed below the weir on Manhan Brook
and two old houses and barn on the department’s land were
tern down, part of the lumber being used in other work, besides other minor improvements.

During the early summer an organism known as chlamydomonas appeared in the high service reservoir, making the
water very unpalatable for time, and about midsummer a
vegetable organism, the odor from which is very lke that
emittcd by certain small black and white animal, sometimes
mistaken for eat, became very prevalent in the reservoir and
affected the water so that it became not only decidedly unpalatable but almost nauseating, making it necessary to discontinue the use of the water from this reservoir.

After thorough investigation by the engineer and superintendent it was finally decided to empty the reservoir, but
in crder that the water might not be lost it was run into the
Bray reservoir and from there it percolated through the
ground into Wright Pond; in this way the odor and tastes were
eliminated, making the water fit for use.

The high service reservoir was allowed to remain empty
for time to see what effect the frost would have on the nitella,

‘that being the name of the plant which caused the trouble.
From examinations made by the engineer, it was found that
the water at the surface of the reservoir and for several feet
below the surface had no trace of the nitella odor or taste about
it, that at the lower levels and bottom only being affected.
This may be accounted for because of the fact that the nitella
growth is mostly found at the bottom of the reservoir. If no
other feasible plan for correcting the trouble is presented, it

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
is probable that measures will be adopted by the Board to
| have the water taken from the surface of the reservoir when
the nitella is flourishing instead of from near the bottom, where
the present outlet pipe is located.

For the better protection of the Fomer water supply, the

. Board petitioned the State Board of Health to establish rules —
and regulations governing the water shed.

The matter was taken up promptly by the State Board and

the necessary rules adopted and forwarded to this Board who
had copies of the same posted in the several townships affected,
and filed with town clerks.  ,
For more detailed account of the work accomplished by
the department during the past eleven months, you are respectfully referred to the superintendent’s report to the Board,
which is made part of this report.

The Board is pleased to announce reduction in the domestic rates, amounting to approximately to take effect January Under the new schedule the family rate
will be reduced making it  year instead of ,
and the rate for bath tubs reduced forty cents, making it 
instead of 'a year. In addition to this, no charge will be
made for extra water closets or extra bath tubs in single family
houses, or in any one tenement in tenement houses, where such
additional fixtures are used by only one family.

The meter privilege also is extended to owners of buildings containing four or more tenements and minimum rate
established of  year, per family, plus the meter rental,
for all the water used not exding gallons year per
family. All water used in excess of that quantity to be paid
for at the regular price charged for metered water, namely,

five and two-third cents per one thousand gallons. The bills
are to be paid quarterly and the same discount for prompt
payment will be allowed on both fixtures and metered rates as
at present, namely, ten per cent.

The charge for each eubic vard of masonry is reduced
from three cents to two cents.

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.

The department has had successful eleven months, in
spite of the financial depression and the drought which naturally affected the consumption of city water at the mills, and
of the fact that reduction of about  was made in the :

} city’s bill, the balance on hand at the close of that period be‘ing and allowing for the receipts und expenditures
for December, which includes the payment of  for interest on bonds, the balance at the close of the year will be over
$ .

Over  has been added to the Sinking Fund during
the past eleven months,  of this amount having been
transferred from the water rents account, making the total
amount in the fund  on November  .

There has been plentiful supply of water, despite the
drought, and our engineer reports that there is enough water
in the reservoirs, at the present time, to supply the city for
about eleven months, condition upon which the city may well
be congratulated, especially as many of our neighboring cities
have been sorely tried in furnishing their inhabitants with
sufficient. water for present needs.

The quality has, with few exceptions, been excellent.

We print herewith copy of the special act relating to the
finances of this department, and referred to earlier in the report, which was passed by the legislature in March of this
year, the bill as passed having been approved of by the Board.

COMMITTEE ON RATES.
Helycke, Mass., Oetcber .
The Board of Water Commissioners, Holyoke, Mass.: —

GENTLEMEN :—The cominittee, to whom was referred the
matter of domestic rates for water, with instructions to prepare tables for reduction of such rates and submit them to
the Board, after carefully considering the matter, respectfully
presents for your consideration, the following recommendations:

 That the family rate which is now  per annum
be reduced to  per annum. |

 That the charge for each cubic vard of masonry be established at two cents, instead of three cents, the present rate.

 That all other fixed rates be left as established.

 That the meter privilege be extended to the owners
of all buildings containing four or more tenements, upon peti tion of said owners to the Board, stating the number of tenements to be metered, and the size of meter required; and that
the rate for the same shall be established as follows:

A minimum rate of  per year for each family, plus
the present meter rental, payable quarterly, for all the water
used not exding gallons per quarter per family, and
that all water used excess of gallons per family a
quarter be paid for at the present rate for metered water.

 That the Board reserve the right to install not ex ding one hundred meters year.

 That the same discounts apply as at present.

REPORT OF
Commissioner Hugh McLean, Chairman
of Committee on Rates.
| Ilolyoke, Mass., October .
The Honorable Board of Water Commissioners, City of Holyoke, Mass.: d
GENTLEMEN :—In presenting to you the report of your
special committee, consisting of Registrar Pickup, Superin| tendent Kirkpatrick, Engineer Tighe and myself to study
into the possibility of further reduction in water rates for
domestic purposes, might say at the outset that the filing of
the report was not delayed on account of any indifference or +
apathy shown the subject by your committee, but on account
of the magnitude of the subject to be considered which not
only called for great familiarity with all conditions directly
and indirectly connected therewith, but for the solving of difficult economie and equitable problems which the subject involved.
| As chairman of your committee present herewith some
reasons for conclusions arrived at. substantial total reduetion of about  year was our objective point. Various
reductions were at first considered. For instance it was arcued that the water closet rate should be reduced some and
that the bath rate meght be reduced also; also the faucet rate.
For reviewing results from such conclusions, tables were prepared by registrar, showing the number of homes and tenements with faucet; with faucet and water closet; with faucet,
water closet and bath, finding many with no water closet or
bath, and some with several water closets and baths. An equitable distribution of the reduction applying to all, er as nearly

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD. ,
all as possible was our desire, we abandoned the idea of reducing bath and water closet rates and applied the whole fixed rate
reduction on the faucet, basing our conclusions, first, that
, water taken from the faucet is.nearly all for domestic purposes; second, that less waste is made of water at the faucet
sink, as continuous leak or dribble before the eye is nuisance and will not be tolerated long before waste is stopped,
but leaks through the average water closet tanks are more numerous and continue longer and waste more water. Same
often applies to urinals and bath tubs; third, the reduction
would mean flat reduction of twenty per cent on the faucet
rate per family to every family, which means substantial reduction alone of  year, and to those having many tenements it means good saving yearly.

Having come to above conclusions through our experience:
and study of conditions and with the aid of tables prepared
by registrar, and having in mind permanent continuation of

 the policy established by the Board, that water should be sold
to all at the same price regardless of quantity used, and wishing to encourage the gradual application of that privilege without too great loss that would impair the efficiency of the department.

The tables prepared show the number of single houses

with and without baths and water closets,  Double
houses with and without baths and water closets,  Three

tenement houses with and without baths and water closets,
 Four tenement houses with and without baths and water
closets,  The balance of users are from five, six, eight, ten

and twelve up to sixty tenement blocks. The purpose of those
tables was to show the actual number that might avail themselves of the privilege of metering water, and what per cent
would find it profitable, and what our loss would be if all petitioned for the privilege that our tables show that it would be
profitable for them to do. Out tables show houses in the
from four to sixty tenement class who if availed themselves

of the metered privilege, instead of the twenty per cent faucet.

REPORT OF WATER BOARD. ‘
reduction, would mean an additional loss of  more to the
department annually. But such is not likely to happen in one
year, and if one-third did, it would bring the net reduction to
$ the amount the committee originally started in to reeommend. But in order to be safe, the committee recommends
that the Board reserve the right to limit the number installed
annually to one hundred, thereby extending the maximum loss

into the future. The possibility of single and double houses
- petitioning for meters can safely be eliminated, as it would
not be economic for either the house owner or the department,
| as the returns from the various test meters in single and
double houses show an average per capita consumption very.
near amount allowed, if purchased through meter at price recommended in reduction.

It is also our conclusion that little benefit comes from meters in single or double house property. Reports of our inspectors and test meter returns show little evidence of waste.
This bears out the experience of many municipalities and
opinions held by leading water department authorities
throughout the country, that metering fifty per cent of the
taps of supply is sufficient to determine the legitimate use
and wanton waste. With the meters now in use and the
gradual acceptance of the proposed privilege, such state of
perfection is assured, and will benefit the consumer by a
further reduction of rates, and the department in the further
reduction in the consumption of water, and consequent reduction of large expenditures for extensions.

In conclusion, desire to make it distinctly understood
that it is not our purpose to force meters on the public; on the
eontrary, meters will be installed only when written applica. tion is made fcr them.
Respectfully submitted,
(Signed) HUGH McLEAN.

Report of the Superintendent.
To the Honorable Board of Water Commussioners:

GENTLEMEN :—This report of your superintendent covering the eleven months ending November is respectfully submitted.

Heretofore the fiscal year of this department ended with
the calendar year on December  but hereafter November  ,
in accordance with Chapter of the Acts and Resolves of
 will end each year’s work in this as well as in all other departments of the city.

The extension to the distribution system will be found
in Table of this report.

The old four-inch main that was laid in Northampton
street, in the year  from Gilman street to the lower hydrant near Whiting Farm has been replaced by an eight-inch
main. In the year four-inch main was laid from Whiting Farm to Mt. St. Vincent. In the near future this should
be replaced by larger main. The old four-inch main laid.
in the year  between the City Farm and Mt. St. Vincent
has been replaced by twelve-inch main. From Mt. Marie to
the Brightside Institute six-inch main has been laid through
a right of way acquired from the Sisters cf Providence, and

” connected with the old main near the Mcther Home. Since the
above mains were laid the working pressure in the south end
of the city has been increased and the condition of the water
in that section greatly improved. Two long dead ends which
were frequently affected by disagreeable odors and tastes were
connected and made the cireulation of the water possible. In
Jackson street an eight-inch main was laid from Commercial
street easterly to connect with the main near the Farr Alpaca

‘+ Company’s number mill. An eight-inch main was also laid

’

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.

in Lexington avenue from Northampton street easterly  
feet. The temporary galvanized iron pipe in Fountain street
was abandoned and an eight-inch main was laid between
Union and Front streets. In Merrick avenue and also in Longwood avenue four-inch mains have been laid to accommodate
new buildings which in each case were being erected at the
extreme end of the avenue.

The general business depression or panic through which
the country has just passed had marked effect upon the work |,

and expenditures of this department. Very few of the mills
and factories were able to run on even half time. Thousands
of able and willing hands were thrown out of employment and
to the credit of your Board, let it be said that this department afforded relief to many. Last winter when the ground
was covered with snow and the mercury registered close to
zero your board ordered relief work opened up for the benefit of the unemployed. At that time the pipe line from Mt. St.
Vincent to the City Farm and the pipe line from Mt. Marie
to Brightside were laid, and other work which will be men- .
tioned later in this report was started about the reservoirs.
Men were employed as laborers who were not accustomed to
such work, and it was lamentable sight to see high-class mechanies and craftsmen obliged to resort to the pick and shovel
‘because there was no work to be found in their line.
WORK AT THE RESERVOIRS.

At Wright pond new gate house has been built at the easterly end of the intake canal. The building was erected by
Daniel O’Connell’s Sons, the lowest bidders, for on the
foyndation which was put im the year  .

A conerete arch has been built over that portion of the
canal where the embankments on each side are high and the

, earth has been sliding in and blocking up the canal. Before
the. arch was laid the earth on each side of the canal was removed down to the solid ledge and the sides levelled up with

a —

| REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
concrete to the spring of the arch. The canal has been thoroughly cleaned out from the ‘‘cut off’? wall to the gate house;
in some places as much as eight feet of earth was removed from
the canal. There remains about three hundred feet of arching
to be done before this work will be finished and it should be .
done next season.

os The highway between Wright and Ashley ponds has been
raised eighteen inches. —

The dike near the gate house has been raised about two
feet.

At the Upper Whiting Street Reservoir new roadway
has been partly built along the easterly side of the pond from
the end of the dam northerly. few weeks’ work in the
spring will complete the roadway and then the roadway going
up the hill towards Mountain Park may be discontinued and
a long standing nuisance abated. new pipe fence has been
placed on top of the dam and around the gate house. The
barn and the watchman’s shed that stood between the two ;
reservoirs have been removed to new location beyond the
drainage area. Between the two reservoirs an aerating foun tain has been built of concrete at cost of about The
fountain is to be used only at such times as microscopic organisms appear in the water. At such times the water passes
through the fountain and canals from the upper to the lower
reservoir. It is hoped that exposure of the water to the air
and the separation from it of the gases which produce the dis- ‘

agreeable taste and odor will greatly improve the water. As
there has been no occasion to use the fountain it remains to be
seen whether the experiment is success or failure.

At Fomer erib has been built under the weir on the
Manhan river and new ice house has been built cn the
north side of the farm house. Two houses on the water shed,
the Spaulding and Mink houses cwned by the department,
were razed and the lumber used cn other department work.
The very low water afforded an cpportunity to clean out a
portion of the reservoir basin. All the land lines were run

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD. |
out and bound stones set in the ground marking the corners
with initials H. W. W. on each stone.

One of the abutters to property owned by the department
has questioned the accuracy of the survey, but it is expected
that the difference will be adjusted at an early date.

| Two wrought iron tanks were set on the mountain side
west of the farm house to furnish water to the house. The
old sheet spiling dam was badly decayed making the construc- tion of new reservoir or the placing of tanks necessary.

During the past winter the sewer from the house became
clogged and it was found impossible to free it. Consequently
the old sewer was abandoned and new sewer laid from the
house to the brook, distance of about feet.

Two new bridges have been built at Fomer this year by
the town of Southampton. Both bridges span Manhan brook, |
one just above and the other just below the reservoir. On the
condition that the bridge above the reservoir be made of concrete with water tight floor this department contributed 
toward the expense of building the bridges.

Rules and regulations for the purpose of preventing the
pollution and securing the sanitary protection cf the waters
of Fomer Reservoir. and its tributaries have been established
by the State Board of Health. Copies of said rules have been
posted in public places in the towns of Southamptcn, Westhampton and Huntington, and also spread upon the reccrds
of the town clerk of each town...

Upon the request of your Board the state forester examined the land around the reservoirs and sent in his repert cn

his observations giving suggestions for treatment of growing
timber with recommendations for planting. He suggests that
the treatment of growing woods should consist of the thinning out of crooked and diseased trees, that where several
sprouts spring from cne stump the tallest and  straightest
should be selected and the rest taken out, and that where
young pines are struggling to reach the hght through intervenirg branches of voung spreuts the latter should be eut

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
from around them. With reference to planting, he recom- .
mends that white.pine seedlings, two or three years old, should
be set out on the shores of the ponds far enough back from
the water so that the leaves will not drop in. He suggests that
the seedlings be set out in rows feet by feet, which will take
about nine hundred plants per acre. He estimates the cost
of seedlings set at  or  per acre.

CONDITION OF WATER.

During the months of February and March Ashley and
Wright ponds were out of commission, owing to the presence
of Synura in the water. The cucumber odor was very noticeable and none the less objectionable, so that the water from
Wright pond was shut off and the city supplied with water
from Fomer. When such organisms developed in these ponds
heretofore, there was nothing to do but wait until they passed
away, but now since the twenty-inch main was laid through
the rock cut last year, these ponds may be put out of comnnission and the Fomer water used instead. Early in June numerous complaints were received about the odor and taste of
the water from the high service reservoir.’ Investigation showed

) that another animal organism, known as chlamydomonas, was
the cause cf the trouble. Then this reservoir was shut off and
water supplied to the high service section from the Upper
Whiting Street Reservoir. About the end of June large elusters resembling tufts of grass were discovered Just below the
surface of the water; the odor from the tufts resembled that
of shunk. The weed turned out to be what is known as
Nitella. All the water contained in the reservoir was
drawn off into Bray pond from which it pereolated through
the sand and gravel embankments and entered Wright and
Ashley ponds. The high service reservoir  still empty. With
the exceptions above noted the water has been very good.
Although many of our neighboring towns and cities have had

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.
their water supplies sorely tried by the unusual drought of the
past summer (and which remains unbroken) this city has.
sufficient water in storage to last until next fall, should there
be no rainfall in the meantime. Records kept at the United
States Armory in Springfield show that the year  with
the exception of the years and  holds the rec-. |
ord for the past forty-one years for scanty precipitation.

REPORT OF .
CITY AUDITOR.
To the Honorable, the Mayor, and Board of Aldermen:

GENTLEMEN :—I present herewith the annual statement of
the receipts and expenditures for the fiscal year in the
form and manner suggested by the National Municipal League.

I beg to further report that have audited the accounts
of the Water Department, Gas and Electric Department, Tax |
Collector, City Clerk, Milk Inspector and Sealer of Weights

, and Measures and found them correct, with the receipts properly recorded and promptly deposited, and the expenditures
approved in due form.

The Water Department shows its operation for only eleven
months, as it closed its accounts on November to conform
with the city’s fiscal year, where formerly its fiscal year ended
on December  .

The report also contains the city’s borrowing capacity |
and other matters pertinent to the financial side of the city’s
business which may prove of interest.

} Respectfully submitted,
D. W. KENNEY, |
City Auditor.
