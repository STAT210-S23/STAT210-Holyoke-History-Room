REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL  
| Federal Refunds: :
Smith-Hughes’ ....... 
Credits for Work and
Products .............  
Work done for City Departments—no charge,  
Work done for charitable
and educational organizations of the city—no
charge ......... cc  
Accounts Receivable
(contracted for during
the fiscal year).......  
Total..............-$ 

No account has been made here of any work done for
our own school. The jobs done for city departments, for
charitable or educational organizations and earried on our
books in the ‘‘no charge’’ accounts are so treated because 
feel that the training in praetical civics (allowing the pupil
to contribute directly to the welfare of worthy cause)  |
worth more than the money we might receive.

It should be understood that all moneys except Federal
refunds received by this school are now turned into the General Receipts Account of the city and are not applied,
as formerly, to the support of the institution. Few citizens,
unless they have carefully studied the reports of this Board,
realize that the school is giving so great return on the ex- 
penditures.

After considering the above facts it does not seem that 
there should be any difficulty in obtaining adequate funds
with which to earry on this work.

| The Board desires to express its appreciation of the econsistent sympatlry and support given Vocational Education by
the various Jabor organizations in the eity, but regrets exdingly that, to date, the manufacturers and business men,
while sympathetic and, under direct appeal, co-operative, have
evinced little active interest.

REPORT. OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL  

Properly trained workmen are to an industrial community such as Holyoke, or to any organization, necessity,
and their training costs money. Such cost, however, is intangible and difficult for the average employer to really show
from his books, as the biggest items are loss of machine time,
spoilage of machine tools, wasted material, lost time of experienced help taken up by beginner, ete.

Some of the biggest corporations in the country, notably
the Pratt Whitney Company of Hartford, Conn., R. G.
LeBlond Machine Tool Company of Cincinnati, Ohio, TaftPierce Manufacturing Company, Woonsocket, R. I., Ameriean Locomotive Company, Schenectady, N. Y., Norton Com- |
pany, Worcester, Mass., Willys-Overland Company, Toledo,
Ohio, Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, N. Y., and others

are running vocational schools in their shops at their own expense, and declare such schools to be money savers. If this
is so, What an opportunity is presented to the corporation so
placed that somebody else is willing to maintain the school!
The National and State Governments are placing at the disposal of the business men of this country every year for the

training of their help and foremen vast sums of money, and
our Holyoke business men are not getting their fair share
largely because of their apparent lack of interest or indifference. ;

Mr. John S. Merriman, Jr., graduate of our Holyoke
High School, and now student at Springfield: College, has
been engaged on part-time basis as instructor in athletics.
This makes it possible to release one of our academic teachers,
in the afternoon, to carry on classroom work for the Rehabillitation Division.

The vocational training of disabled soldiers is being earried on much the same as year ago. The fact that the Na-.
tional Government has not yet completed the delivery of the
shop equipment as promised for the East Dwight Street
building prevents the instruetion given there being as ecomplete as it should be.

  REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL

In view of the fact that recent legislation provides fo.:
vocational rehabilitation of all persons disabled in industry
and otherwise, and that State supervisor has been named to
take care of this work, it is advisable to carry on strongly
with what we are doing and be prepared to take care of this
new responsibility.

To the Director and Faculty of the Holyoke Vocational
School word of public commendation from the Trustees is
certainly due for their steadfast allegiance to the organization under circumstances which, .had their loyalty been less,
might have caused slacking of interest and effort.

Your attention is called to the statistics in the report of
the Executive Officer.

  REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL
The attendance in the Day School Section is steadily in- \
creasing, although slight falling off is shown in the Rehabilitation Division, due to the fact that some of the men have
been placed in the industries.
During this year we have been obliged at times to delay
admission of boys until the congestion in given department
was relieved or to enter students temporarily in trades other
than the one desired.
Many inquiries are received regarding courses in Auto
Mechanies, Electrical Theory and Practice and Sheet Metal
Working, none of which ean be opened in the present building ;
because all available space is now being used.

The classes in the Evening Trade Extension Section
show decreased attendance, due probably to foreed economy
in the advertising and delayed opening of classes last fall. A
factor to be considered also is that many of the young unmar: ried men are unemployed and temporarily have lost interest in
Co the trade followed.

The women of the city certainly testify to their interest .
- In the Evening Practical Arts Section by the way they avail .
themselves of the opportunities presented.
It seems pity that, with courses of study laid out and
plans made for needed extensions of this service, we are
without the rooms or the funds requisite for proper expansion.
When the new Vocational Building is being planned,
floor space for this work should be provided and the work earried on during the full school year.

No report from this office would be complete without an
acknowledgment of the kindly co-operation given our organization by both employers and tradesmen whenever they -have
been called on for assistance or advice. In the greeting,
‘“What can do for you today ?’’ we find, not stereotyped .

RECOMMENDATIONS

After eareful consideration and in view of the fact that
we are taking care of so many children, we should have a
suitable ‘‘ Nursery’? with veranda to provide for their proper
eare and: comfort.

The old barn and sheds are much in need of coat of
paint, the exterior also of windows and doors in the ‘‘Home
or Main Building’’ require painting.

We are thankful and appreciative for the construction
this vear of the modern and complete Dairy Barn, and other
equipment which now serves the needs of this Institution.

They are indeed creditable and will prove an asset to
the city that we can point to with pride.

Superintendent of City Farm.

For the Year  .
To THE HONORABLE, THE Mayor AND BoarbD OF ALDERMEN OF

together with recommendations for the coming year.

REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS  

No appropriation was made for land purchases, balance
of  being carried from the previous year. No expenditures were made out of this fund.

The parks were opened for the season April ,
and closed October in addition to the usual care
required for the upkeep of the parks, improvements were
made on several parks, the principal being the laying of new
cement walks on Germania Park. An addition was made to
the park area by the taking under eminent domain of the
Prew property adjoming Riverside Park on the south and
containing about two and one-half acres.

Herewith follows general review of the work done on
the parks during the year: |

On Prospect Park two new drinking fountains were installed, one near the Maple street parapet and one between
Chestnut and Elm streets, this addition being greatly needed
for the accommodation of the people in the summer. new
cement walk was constructed from the Elm street driveway
to the ladies’ shelter, and some bad spots in the walks repaired. The trees on the park were given thorough pruning.

On Hampden Park no new work was done, the trees
which were in poor condition were pruned and new shrubs
added. Last year the Board started planting new trees, and

some will be added this spring from stock which the Board ]
already has on hand.

On Elmwood Park about feet of new culvert was
constructed by the Board of Public Works on the west side
of the dingle near Pine street; the fill on the east side is fast
approaching grade, and with the completion of the manhole at
this point it will soon be possible to complete the fill and start
the improvement of this section. The contemplated extension
of High street through the park land east of Maple street
Is matter which will demand the attention of the Board the
coming year. The trees on the park were pruned and new
bleachers added on the Bh Street Playground.

  REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS

On Riverside Park steps have been taken by the Board
to extend this park by the taking of the Prew property at the
south end and the filling of the low land and grading down
of the sand bank bordering Main street to conform with the
grade of the park at this end; the Board has also conferred
with the Holyoke Water Power Company -in relation to the
acquiring of the Jand between the proposed Ferry street extension and the park property on the north end. Several
trees will be planted the coming spring; the wading pool and
athletic fields were well patronized during the season. The
addition of new shelter house with sanitary provisions is
again urged by the Board.

A new drinking bubbler and new lights were installed at
Hamilton park, and the trees pruned; the improvements of
the previous year are source of much satisfaction to the
residents of this loeality as also to the Board. ‘

At Germania Park the old tar walks inside the park were
torn up and replaced with new cement walks on new plan;
the outside walks should be replaced to complete the work
this coming spring and also more trees added.

At Canonehet Park new bubblers were added and the
old fountain repaired; the trees were pruned. Permanent
sidewalks should be constructed on the walks bordering the
park.

At Jones Park nothing was attempted this vear, as our
Improvement account was not large enough to make any showing on this park.

On Fairfield Avenue Parkway, Williston Park and the
other small parks and triangles under this department, the
usual maintenanee work was done; the trees were pruned
and the shrubs eut down.

Through the kindness and generosity of the Farr Alpaca
Company and their band series of band concerts were given
on the parks during the summer, which were greatly appreciated by the people. The Board hopes that provisions ean be

REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS  
made the coming year for the continuance of concerts, as they
tend to attract the people to the use of the parks.

The Board went on record during the year as opposed to all billboards in the city limits, especially in the loeality of parks, and also in favor of parking spaces on the
Northampton highway at or near the Dinosaurus tracks.

- RECOMMENDATIONS.

In conelusion the Board would urge the continuance of
improvement work and sufficient appropriation for the
proper care and maintenance of the parks and would submit
the following estimates for the coming year:

REPORT OF THE
CITY SOLICITOR.
To THE HonorABLE Mayor OF ran CITY or HOLYOKE:
I submit herewith my report for the Year  The following are the cases which were settled a’t’ing the year  

the courts and the amount of settlement in each case:

Rose Gilman .........  ...         ’ 

Bridget McMahon ..............  ...      .,  

George King ......... cc          

Thomas O’Neill, P,P. A, .e...c     

Patrick J. Griffin .....  ...        

Cora L. Simmons ............        |

The Griffin ease above mentioned, was settled the day —,

it was to be tried in the Superior Court, for  of \
which was paid by the property owner whom the city felt

was partially liable for the condition of the sidewalk, which \.
was the cause of the injury. yu
, The year was taken up to great extent by me

on the so-called bridge legislation. Holyoke was again unsuccessful in its efforts to be relieved of part of the
eost of the monumental structure being erected for the

benefit of our neighbors, Springfield and West Springfield .
but am inclined to believe that all other cities and towns

, in the county will again seek relief from the Legislature in

 when the cities and towns are presented enormous bills

which will come to them as their share of the cost of the

bridge.

|

REPORT OF CITY SOLICITOR  
The departments of the city are more and more calling
upon the City Solicitor for advice and great deal of his
time is taken up with this phase of the work. It is my belief that an office should be provided for the City Solicitor in
the City Hall where department heads could consult him
during certain hours of the day. The office of City Solicitor,
. if properly conducted, is no sineeure, and my opinion is that 
the salary is meagre.
I am grateful to the department officials for their kindly
assistance during my term of office.
Respectfully submitted,
EUGENE A. LYNCH,
City Solicitor.

REPORT OF THE
Health Officer.
To THE Boarp oF HEALTH oF THE Crry oF HoLyoKr, Mass:

Gentlemen: respectfully submit the following detailed
report of the Board of Health as carried on under the
direction of its Health Officer.

GENERAL ITEALTH

It has been well said that with well organized Health
Department, community may have as much health as it is
willing to pay for. ,

A low death rate is one of the best indications of the
eeneral health conditions of the community. During the
past year our death rate was lower than any year for a
lone time.

Life and happiness depend wholly upon good health.
This being purchasable, the responsibility of its purchase and
the health of the community is placed squarely upon the
shoulders of those charged with making the appropriation for
health work. :

Many complaints of all kinds have been received and
careful attention has been given to each one and steps taken
to improve conditions and remove the cause.

The general health of the city is influenced by many
factors and in order to accomplish the best results, the Board
of Health must cover many lines and each year sees an inerease in the amount of work required of this department, not

, ‘

only in the prevention of contagious diseases, but in many
| lines bearing upon the safeguarding of the public health.
 The contagious disease tables and the mortality records ,
also show an evidence of its healthfulness, and by comparing
these rates for number of years the information is valuable.
VITAL STATISTICS

ANNUAL REPORT OF
 ]
Board of Public Works.
THE HoNnorase, THE Mayor AND MEMBERS OF THE BoarpD OF |

ALDERMEN OF THE City oF HOLYOKE, MASSACHUSETTS.

) GENTLEMEN: The report of the Department of Public
Works for the fiscal year ending November is appended hereto.

The most serious problem confronting the Board durimg
the past year has been that presented by the unemplovment
situation. Early in February, after conference with the
Board, the Mayor thought it advisable to reeommend to the ,
Board of Aldermen the passage of loan order so that permanent work might be started to relieve this condition. The
only werk permissible during the winter months was the relocation of Northampton Street at Whiting’s Hill, so-called.
This work was started, the men working in two shifts, each
for three-day period at time. By this method of employment hundreds of men were enabled to maintain their homes,
who otherwise would have been foreed to seek aid from the
Relief Department. Widespread unemployment still presents
a serious problem to the Board at the opening of the new
year, and it  urged that an appropriation be made at once
for permanent construction so that immediate relief may be
afforded.

: The total expenditures for new construction and maintenance from the regular appropriation amounts to
Nine Hundred Eighty-five Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-two
Dollars and Forty-three Cents ($ ). balance was
brought forward from to amounting to Seventy-five

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS ,

. Thousand One Hundrey Twenty-two Dollars and Twenty-six
Cents ($ ). Appropriations were made from loans for
permanent highways in the amount of Two Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($ for sewers, Twenty Thousand Dollars
($ for sidewalks,Ten Thousand Dollars ($ ;
for addition to the Ward One Bath House, Twenty-four Thousand Dollars ($ for bridge construction, Two Hundred Six Thousand Dollars ($ for the City Farm
Barn, Forty Thousand Dollars ($ and for portable school, Seven Thousand Dollars ($ making a
total of Five Hundred Seven Thousand Dollars ($ ).
Original appropriations were made from taxation amounting
to Five Hundred Seventeen Thousand Seven Hundred Fortyone dollar and six cents ($ ). Additional appropriations were made in the amount of Twenty-seven Thousand Three Hundred Dollars ($ ), while supplementary appropriations from taxation were made amounting
to Seventy-nine Thousand Seven Hundred Twenty Dollars
($ ). The receipts of all departments total Forty-six
Thousand Seven Hundred Twenty-eight Dollars and Eightyone Cents ), making total eredit to the department from all sources for the year  of One Million Two
Hundred Fifty-three Thousand Six Hundred Twelve Dollars
and Thirteen Cents ($ ). The department has
transferred from various departments Thirty-four Thousand
Four Hundred Forty-nine Dollars and Ejighty-two Cents
($ ), and has earried forward in balances to the year
 Two Hundred Thirty-three Thousand Four Hundred
Ninety-nine Dollars and Eighty-eight Cents ($ ).

The most important work during the year was the construction of four new canal bridges, viz: Across the Second
Level Canal on Jackson Street across the Second Level Canal
on Appleton Street; across the First Level Canal on Lyman
Street; and the Valley Bridge, so-called. The awarding of
the contract for the Second Level Canal bridge on Lyman

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
Street has been held up until such time as the County Commissioners grant the Board permission to replace the stone
abutment supporting the railroad overhead bridge with pier
of steel construction. The replacing of this stone pier with
one of steel construction eliminates the dangerous conditions
which now exist owing to the obstruction to the vision of
motorists going east in Lyman Street. Plans are being completed at the present time which will include the reinforcing
of the Willimansett bridge, together with new permanent
roadway. Money for this work was included in the bridge
appropriation of Two Hundred Six Thousand Dollars ($ ). It is hoped that there will be an additional appro- |
priation this year that will permit the replacing of more of
the old canal bridges which are below the standard now required by the State Department of Public Utilities.

During the past year the Board has constructed permaneut roadways in the followmg locations, viz: Appleton
Street, from High Street to the crossing of the Holvoke and
Westfield Railroad; Appleton Street, from Winter Street to
Canal Street: High Street, between Cabot and Sargeant
Streets; High Street, between Lyman and Fountain Streets;
Hamilton Street, between Main and Canal Streets; Jackson
Street, between Bridge and Canal Streets; Lyman Street, between Bridge and Center Streets; Northampton Street, between Whiting’s Hill, so-called, and Westfield Railroad underpass; Springfield Road, between Saint Vincent Street and
West Springfield Line; westerly side of Winter Street from
Appleton Street north, approximately thirteen hundred
( feet; reinforced concrete floor on the Third Level
Canal bridge on Main Street.

The Board this year built its first reinforced concrete
roads to accommodate heavy traffic. The pavements on the
lower Springfield Road and Winter Street are of reinforced
construction, and from present indications will outlast any
pavement in the city. The concrete pavements on both the

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS

Springfield Road north of the West Springfield Line and on
Northampton Street north of the junction of the Springfield .
Road give the city for approaches the finest Inghways in
Western Massachusetts.

The Board being cognizant of the heavy trucking to and
from the mills along the Third Level Canal deemed it advisable to replace the old pavements on Jackson and Hamilton
Streets. The concrete pavements on these streets are much
appreciated by the manufacturers along the “Third Level
Canal as well as by the abutters.

The new conerete pavement on High Street between Cabot

 and Sargeant Streets replaces one of the oldest water’bound
macadam roads in the city. The old road was in sectio?? of
unusually heavy traffie and gave surprisingly good service WP
to few years ago, when constant patching beeame ineffective:
and waste of money. The same was true of the pavement
on Northampton Street at Whiting’s Hill, so-called.

Appleton Street from High Strect to the Holyoke and
Westfield Railroad was paved with re-eut granite blocks.
The grade of this street and the danger to horses on the slippery pavement made it impracticable to lay conerete surface, and the re-cut granite blocks were laid on five-ineh
concrete base. The old pavement on the Third Level Canal
bridge on Main Street was torn up and replaced with a
reinforeed concrete floor.

As the new Iighways were being constructed in the
various sections of the city, the materials excavated from the
streets were used to biild semi-permanent roads in the same
sections. Thus, while the Springfield Road was being built
the material excavated was used for the streets in Springdale,
Improving them greatly. In lke manner the material excavated in Northampton Street at Whiting’s Hill, so-called, in
High Street, and in Hamilton and Jackson Streets, was used
for the improvement of the adjacent side streets.

On November an additional appropriation of

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
Fitty Thousand Dollars ($ was made for new
highway construction. This appropriation was made to enable
. the city to furnish employment to the many men who were
suffering because af the business depression. Through the
. much appreciated courtesy of the Water Commissioners mn
| permitting the Board to eross land of the Water Department
| at Ashley Ponds, work has been started on the construction
of highway which will eliminate two dangerous curves on
the Rock Valley Road. This road will lessen the distance
about one-half mile and will also reduce the grade so that
heavy loads may be more easily hauled to West Holyoke and
all points west. The road is also connecting link in the new
. State Highway which was completed this vear from Westfield
to Southampton and whieh will eventually be the route to
the west over improved highways.

A new cattle barn, hoe house and hennery were econstrueted this vear at the City Farm, improvements much
needed and requested for many vears. The eattle and other
live stock at. the Farm were being maintained under conditions |
which were deplorable until these improvements were made.
New sheds were also erected so that now all farm equipment
‘may be kept under cover.

The ereetion of an addition to the Ward One Bath House
was started during the vear and will be ready for oeceupaney |
early in  This addition was imperative as no allowance
was made for the privacy necessary where both sexes are to
use the swimming pool. The building is structure of two
stories and basement and provides for the complete segregation of sexes, The present rooms are now equipped with lockers, Showers, toilets, ete. The completion of the building will
put in operation the investment represented by the original
outlay.

A two-room portable school has been built adjoining the
William Whiting School and will be ready for occupancy

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
after the Christmas holidays. This will relieve the crowded
condition at that school.

The principal work of the Sewer Department during the
past year has been the installation of many house connections, especially in the section known as the Fidelity tract,
west of Northampton Street. Permanent sewers were constructed in the following locations, viz: Allyn street, west
of Arlington Street; Brookhne Avenue, west of Alto Street;
Chapin Street, north of Congress Avenue and westerly in
Walnut Street extended; extension through Murray property
on west side of Chapin Street north of Gates Street; Clark
Street, at extreme west end; Columbus Avenue, from Northampton street westerly to point approximately six hundred
( feet west of Hillside Avenue; Corser Street, west of
Isabella Street; culvert in Bh Street dingle, so-called;
Isabella Street, southerly from Corser Street; Locust Street,
northerly from Hampshire Street; Martin Street, south from
Hitcheoek Street; Northampton Street between Sargeant
Street and Columbus Avenue; Queen Street, south from King
Street.

Conerete sidewalks were constructed in the following
locations, viz: At the northerly corner of Appleton and Race
Streets; Cabot Street, south side at the Precious Blood Church ;
East Dwight Street, south side, east of Bowers Street Lexington Avenue, south side, east of Northampton Street; Longwood Avenue, south side, west of Northampton Street; Main
Street, east side, at the Century Machine Company; Race
Street, east side, north of Sargeant Street; Sargeant Street,
south side, west of Bh Street; southwest corner of Suffolk and Elm streets; West Street, west side, south of Ely
Strect.

New curbing was set in the following locations, viz:
Northampton Street, west side, south of the entrance of the
Mount Tom Golf Club; View Street, south side, west of
Larkin Avenue.

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  

A very serious problem is presenting itself in the increasing motor vehicle traffic in the streets of the city. Maple
Street has been widened, both sides, between Appleton Street
and Dwight Street, to permit the parking of automobiles on
the east side of the street and the passage of north and
south-bound traffic in the remainder of the street. very
bad condition which existed on Hampden Street between
Nonotuck and Péarl Streets was eliminated by removing the
tree belt and moving the curbing back on both sides of the
street, thereby giving more passage room for vehicles that
use this street to very great extent.

During the past vear the Board purchased two tractors, 
equipped with snowplow attachments; also snowplow attachment for its  -ton truck. This equipment proved its
worth during the one large snowstorm when the highways
throughout the city, including the outlying districts and
eountry roads, were opened up for traffic within twenty-four
hours. The Board was greatly assisted at this time by the
co-operation of the Chamber of Commerce in obtaining addi. tional equipment from its members. During the summer the
tractors were used for traction power on plows and as stump
pullers in road construction. '

A great deal of repair work and many necessary improvements have been made in all the public buildings. Considerable repairs have been made on the boilers at great
expense, including the installing of new tubes, fire boxes,
grates, and other minor work. With the amount of use these
boilers are put to during the winter months the same repairs
will be necessary the coming year owing to the age of the

- boilers.

In order to rectify the unsanitary conditions at the
Park Street and Elmwood School buildings modern sanitaries
were installed for the bovs, relieving long-felt anxiety of
both teachers and parents for the health of the children.

Electric wiring and fixtures were installed at the South

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
Chestnut, Sargeant and Park Street School buildings, placing
these schools on par with the more modern buildings.

At the Morgan School supply rcom was made into a
teachers’ rest room, and new supply room was made out of
the unused sanitaries. New sewing, domestie science and
printing rooms with the necessary hehting and heating systems
were installed. The roof was also repaired.

At the Joseph Metealf School domestie seienece room
with all the necessary facilities in the line of plumbing and
heating was installed in the basement, and the roof repaired.

The interior of the Highland School has been painted
throughout with the exception of the corridors. The new
manual training rocm was plastered, new treads were put on
the stan's, and the roof was put in first class condition. ‘

At the Nonotuck Street School closet for supplies was
built, and new toilet was installed in the basement.

New domestic science and sewing rooms were installed
in the basement of the West Street School.

At the High School, the roof and skylights were repaired,
and the electric light svstem was extended and repaired.

At the Hamilton Street School the roof was repaired, and
the floors and stairs were re-laid. classroom was made out
of supply room.

At the Elmwood School new heating system was installed in the sanitaries and in two rooms on north side of
the building.

At the City [all the gutters were replaced and new brass
hand rails leading to the ladies’ rest room were installed.

At the East Dwight Street School the electric wiring was
renovated and gutters repaired,

The interior of the Elmwood Engine House was given
two coats of paint, placing this building in very good condition.

At the Mount Tom Engine House the rooms on the seeond fleor were rearranged for the convenience of the men.

j

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
| Metal ceilings, new baths and toilets were installed, placing
this building in first-class condition,

At the Relief Engine House, because of the motorization
of the department and the consequent heavy apparatus, it
Was necessary to shore up the main floor.

At the Highland Engine House all the rooms on tie seeond floor were repainted with two coats of paint.

The Milk Station was painted throughout with two coats
of paint.

The city has been unfortunate the past vear in the fires

: at the Ewingville and South Chestnut Street Schools. The
Ewingville School building was totally destroved for school
purposes. Upon recommendation of the School Board what
remained of the building was sold and subsequently demol- ished, the eity retaining the property. At the South Chestnut
Street School building it was necessary to practically rebuild
several rooms, construet new walls and ceilings, and to place
a new roof over that portion of the building affeeted by the
fire. Another unforeseen expenditure was that of rebuilding
the ehimney, skylight, and other repairs at the Vocational
Sehool, which was struck by lightning,

In addition to the new construction at the City Farm
many necessary lmprovements were made in the old buildings.
The steam return and water pipes were renewed throughout;
the roof of the old barn was painted with waterproof composition; the floors in the old barn were re-laid; new tank
with pipme was installed in the laundry, and new cesspool
was constructed to take care of the waste water from this
building. The inmates of this institution have assisted the
Board to great extent in the work around the buildings, and
the Board appreciates the co-operation of the Overseers of the
Poor in this instance.

When the appropriations were made for this year the
sum of Eight Thousand Dollars ($ was allowed for
long needed improvements at the Holyoke Publie Library.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS

A new registration case and delivery counter have been placed
in the Library, and two glass partitions and screens are in
process of erection in the rotunda. The reading rooms on the
main floor have been equipped with new lghting system
which has proven very efficient, and number of changes
have been made in the Librarian’s room.

A start was made during the past year to provide adequate traffic signals for both pedestrian and vehicular traffic
throughout the city. beacon light was established at the
intersection of Northampton and Dwight Streets, which eliminates the dangerous condition which had existed there. The
Board has purchased another beacon light to be placed at
the intersection of the lower Springfield Road and Northampton Street at Brightside. Hospital zone signs were placed
in the vicinity of Holyoke’s two hospitals, which are appreciated by the patients as well as the hospital authorities. At
numerous dangerous intersections silent policemen were
placed. Safety zones on the main streets of the city were
established. Traffic signs were placed so that no excuse might
be offered for violating the city ordinances. The Board feels
that to continue this work an additional appropriation must
be made in the Highway Account.

Attention is called to the ever increasing territory necessary to be covered by the Alley Department and the consequent need of additional funds if this work is to be carried
on satisfactomly. Attention is also called to the shortage of
dumping grounds. culvert approximately one hundred
( feet in length was constructed the past year in the
Bh Street dingle, so-called, and it is but matter of a
short time when the fill will be completed in this location and
new grounds must be obtained for the disposal of ashes and
rubbish. The Board believes that it is matter of economy
to purchase trucks and trailers for the hauling of ashes from
central collecting points in the various sections of the city to
the dumping grounds. The Board realizes that it would be

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
inipossible to use motor apparatus in many sections of the city,
especially in the alleys in the business sections, but it believes
that the trucks would be of material saving in long hauls.
In many ways the department is carrying on its work in the
same manner and under the same conditions that it has for
years, and, in the opinion of the Board, material changes in
the method of doing the work should be instituted.

The number of catch basins in the city is increasing it
is becoming more difficult to secure men who will go into the
basins to clean them, so that it will be necessary to buy appliances for doing this very important work.

The Forestry Department has great amount of work
outlined for the coming year, much of which resulted from
the havoe wrought by the recent sleet and rain storms, the
damage being especially serious in the outskirts of the city,
trees having been blown down and the limbs of others broken
and cracked. )

Attention is again ealled to the lack of housing for equipment at the City Yard. At the present time there is no place
to store equipment under cover and the Board believes that
this condition should be remedied at onee. It is again recommended that the lot south of the City Yard property be
bought from the Holyoke Water Power Company, thus enlarging the facilities of the City Yard.

. New apparatus should be purchased consisting of portable stone erusher, new flusher for the Street Watering
Department, also twelte-ton three-wheel roller with searifier
attachment for the Highway Department. The Pesthouse
property, so-called, has been found to contain excellent traprock, and the Board desires to establish quarry on this property. This quarry will produce enough traprock for all the
requirements of the Board for many years to come.

The Board makes the following recommendations relative
to the maimtenance of public buildings, viz: That sprinklers
be installed throughout public buildings. That enough money

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
be appropriated to permit the public buildings to be painted
on the outside as they are rapidly deteriorating for the want
of paint. It is also recommended that imsuranee on these
buildings be written for term of three years instead of one
year, aS at present, as this would result in the saving of about

| twenty percent in premiums; that steam heating plant be
installed in the Nonotuck Street School building to replace
the furnaces now there, which should be removed as they constitute serious menace to. the safety of the children in that
building; that the roots of many of the school buildines, as
well as the gutters and conduetors, be replaced; that conerete
floors be placed in the Highland Engine Ilouse and the Rehef Engme House: that in the High Sehool building the entire
Interior be painted, and the gutters and conductors on the roof
of this building be repaired at once; that new windows be
installed throughout the Ilamilton Street and South Chestnut
Street School buildings.

The Board wishes to call attention to the faet that the
Vocational School building is unsafe for its present use.
Originally designed as school building, it is now being used
as factory, although not of mill eonstruetion, and the Board
does not wish to assume responsibility for accidents that might
occur there as the result of this condition,

The Board recommends that permanent highways be constiueted in locations as follows, viz: Cherry Street from F
Northampton Street to Homestead Avenue; Northampton
Street, from the Mount Tom Golf Club northerly to Kenilworth Castle; Springfield Road, from Day Avenue southerly
to the end of the present paving; re-cut granite blocks on
concrete hase on Appleton Street from the east side of the
First Level Canal bridge to Winter Street tar macadam eonstruction on Cabot and Essex Streets from Maple to Pleasant
Street; eonerete pavement on Suffolk Street from Chestnut
Street to Linden Street; that Main Street, west side, south of
Dwight Street, be repaved with permanent material other than

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
wood blocks; that the paving of Winter Street north of Appleton Street be completed; that Madison Avenue be extended
and apted as public highway from Jefferson to Nonotuck
Streets; that Appleton Street, both sides, from Maple to
Chestnut Streets, Suffolk Street, south side, from Maple to
Chestnut Streets, and Chestnut Street, east side, from Appleton to Dwight Streets, be widened to relieve traffie congestion
in this section, which is daily becoming menace to publie
safety.

| Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($ was paid out
of Permanent Highway Account to the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts as the city’s portion of the cost of new
macadam road from the Easthampton line to point about
one mile east. The Board believes that the eity should use every
effort this year to have the State Department of Public Works
continue the Improvement of the Easthampton Road from its
present terminus to Northampton Street. If necessary, action
of the Legislature should be sought forcing the State Department of Public Works to complete this work. In this eonnection it Is advised that careful study be made of the proposed
new lavout of the road into Northampton Street with a
view of eliminating the heavy grade on the present layout
of the Easthampton Road.

A project that should receive serious consideration is the
re-opening of public highway of Race Street from Sargeant
Street southerly, Race Street thus extended, joining Main
Street about opposite the Old Ferry Road, so-called.

The extension of Iligh Street from Norfolk Street to
South Street should be given serious consideration. This improvement is one greatly needed, and will remove dead end
from the main business street of the city and will give the
business section connection with the Springfield Road. Beeause of the church and schoolhouse on Maple Street between
Sargeant and Franklin Streets, and the attendant danger from
street car traffic, it is desired to have the Elmwood cars routed

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
through High Street instead of Maple Street. The extension’
of High Street would permit this to be done. Conferences’
have been held with the Holyoke Water Power Company and
the Park Commissioners relative to acquiring the land necessary for the proposed extension, and the Board believes*that |
the city may obtain the land without any great expense:..  :
This year the Board carried forward certain funds which ;
were set aside for repaving the South Hadley Falls Bridge.
Plans had been completed and had received the approval and )
sanction of Lewis E. Moore, Bridge and Signal Engineer of
the State Department of Pubhe Utilities at that time. These
plans called for cement slab which was to be covered with
an asphalt wearing surface. hearing was given to interested parties of both South Hadley Falls and Holyoke by this
Board in conjunetion with the Board of Selectmen of South
Iladley, and it was deemed inadvisable to pave the bridge
according to the orignal plans as the method of construction
proposed would necessitate closing up the entire bridge, causing excessive losses to both communities. This Board then
considered other forms of construction. In the meantime,
however, the Board of Seleetmen of South Hadley had
awarded contract for pavement to be built im sections.
This led to controversy which did not come to an amieable
settlement until November which was then too late
to start work on the Ifolvoke end of the bridge. Therefore,
it was decided to use the money set aside for the bridge pavement for permanent highway construction. The coming vear
it js recommended that an appropriation be made for the purpose of reinforcing and paving the South Hadley Falls Bridge.
The Board further recommends that four new canal
bridges be constructed as follows, viz: Over the First and ,
Seeond Level Canals on Cabot Street; over the Second Level
Canal on Sargeant Street; and over the Second Level Canal
on Dwight Street. The present structures were not designed

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
to carry the heavy loads passing over them at the present time
and are inadequate.

st will be necessary to provide funds for the maintenance
' of the Ward One Bathhouse the coming year.
, The Board recommends that lights be installed in the
* Smiths Ferry and West Holyoke districts. If these lights
are to be installed it will be an added expense in the lighting
department which must be met by appropriation.
The Board further recommends that the Ewingville
School property be turned over to the Playground Commission
for the benefit of the children in that district.
Annexed you will find detailed accounts of the expenditures in the various departments.

REPORT OF THE
e e
Child Welfare Commission.
To THe ITONORABLE, THE MAYOR AND THE BOARD OF ALDERMEN
OF THE Ciry or ILloLyoKr, MASSACHUSETTS:

Gentlemen: We herewith submit the third annual report of the Child) Welfare Commission :

The work of the Commission has been conducted during
the past year along the lines of previous years, except as
those activities have been extended and broadened.

It is no longer necessary to explain to an intelligent public the reasons for supporting department of Child Welfare
as interpreted by the work and covering the field it does
here in’ Holyoke.

Some indieation of the work accomplished is here shown
in this report which includes infant care, maternal care, and
pre-school health supervision. |

Infant mortality rate means the number of babies under
one year of age who die out of every one thousand born. The
complete birth registration is impossible to learn for several
months yet, beeause of the laxity of some physicians in
complying with the state law and also the laxity of law enforcement in that particular. While the city’s standing has
improved in the past ten years, it is the opinion of those
working on and using the city’s vital statisties, that further
and more strict legislation is necessary to bring these delinquent physicians to realize the importance of registering
births promptly and fully.

a  REPORT OF THE CHILD WELFARE DEPARTMENT

Holyoke’s infant mortality has been an interesting study

to those working directly on this problem for the past ten
'-years.

The births registered to date, for the year are  .
Died under one year of age, and above one week,  The
Child Welfare Department had under its care, with feeding,
 under its observation, weighing and advice,  total
 There were twelve deaths. These figures are from
December  to December They show an infant
mortality rate of babies under the Department’s care of  
per  Allowing that the figures for the city births and
deaths for the year shall be in approximately the same proportion as last year, or about  and excluding Brightside, the
infant mortality rate for the city is about  whch is the ,
lowest recorded. ,

The attendance at the baby clinic has greatly exded
any previous year. The mothers find that regular attendance
pays for the instruction and help received. It might well
be called the school for mothers, for one mother said, ‘‘I miss
a lot when don’t come’’. Seventeen hundred and forty-two
babies were brought to the clinic. The weather man may
be thanked for some of this good showing, however, as there
have been exceptionally few very unpleasant Thursdays.

The supervising nurse, Miss Luella Thomson, and her
substitute, Miss Lois Davis, made home visits, teaching
home modification of the milk, wherever advisable and dirccting mothers in the eare of their homes and children.

There are many mothers who find it helpful to come to
the station, whose babies are not receiving the feeding service
but who need advice and for regular weighing of the child;
we separate these eases in our statistics for obvious reasons.
They include mostly breast-fed babies. Breast-feeding  s
insisted on or eneouraged in every possible case.

The special infant care, then, consists in furnishing modified or whole milk of high grade to babies, also the preparation of special formulae for sick and malnutrition eases.

REPORT OF THE CHILD WELFARE DEPARTMENT  
, Visits to the homes by the trained nurse for supervision
of the care of babies and the teaching of mothers.

Weekly clinics, where babies are weighed and examined
and mothers advised or encouraged.

The population of Holyoke has increased about in|
the past ten years, and the infant death rate has fallen in
an inverse ratio. That there are other contributing factors
toward this end, such as better sanitation, stricter and more
intelligent supervision of contagious diseases, increased
scientific medical knowledge, yet here as in the country as a
whole has been felt the great strides made in the reduction of
infant mortality through specialized and directed infant
welfare activities.

Under maternal care is provided prenatal nurse for
co-operation with the medical profession in care of and advice
to, the expectant mother, obtaining proper and adequate
medical and nursing service at the time of confinement,
especial attention to negelected or needy mothers at this
critical time, which ineludes the making of urinalyses and
the taking of the blood pressure.

The prenatal nurse, Mrs. Ella Perkins, cared for  
mothers, between December  and December .

Of these were carried until delivery. This was
about per cent. These cases came under the nurse's care

 in the following order of time:
  had less than months’ care (from

  day to months)............... TT deaths of infants
  had less than months’ eare....... ‘cs
  had months’ care................ ‘co

at  REPORT OF THE CHILD WELFARE DEPARTMENT

Total deaths  of which there were: stillborn  prematures  between days and days  No maternal
deaths.

The figures for the city were: births registered  ;
deaths under year  under week  stillborn  prematures  Total deaths  exeluding stillborn. Making
the same allowance for inereased registration this gives the
city an infant mortality rate of  and of those having prenatal care  .

Only three of the mothers refused to nurse their
babies; of the only were eventually reeommended to
the milk station for feedings. These figures show something

what prenatal care  effecting in this direetion, since we have
earried practically one-third ,,) of the eity baby population
on the milk station, but only one-sixteenth of those
whose mothers had the prenatal nurse’s care. Mrs. Perkins
made ealls in connection with this service. There were
seven women who had the benefit of the City Hospital free,
or partial pay bed.

That trained nursing supervision, advice and care, before
and after child-birth, influence greatly the death rate of .
“babies in the earher months and also the maternal deaths, is
unquestionable,

A comparison of the figures of the city as whole, the
majority of the mothers having had no prenatal care, with
those supervised, proves that while we have been working now
some years, saving babies after they have survived the most
erucial and trying hours of arrival, yet we ean accomplish
still more by getting back of the child to the mother, her
health and her environment. This work, as has been said,
is all done in co-operation with and under the direction of
physicians. .

One feature of the station’s work which has developed
during the past year and half, has been the Pre-school and
Nutrition Clinie for children who have passed the age eligible

@

REPORT OF THE CHILD WELFARE DEPARTMENT 
for the baby elinie. Its establishment has been slow that its |
results might be more permanent. These conferences do not
take patients from local physicians, but send cases to them
which might otherwise never be brought to their attention.
Such are the eases where the family ean find the means to
pay for eare and have already a-preferenee of physician.
For those where there is absolute need, the clinie physician
diagnoses and recommends the proper treatment in home or
hospital, and refers the ease to the Children’s Health Fund
Committee for payments. Teachers, sgeial workers, publie
health nurses, or any person knowing of ehild who is not
having proper medieal attention, because of inability of the
parents to pay for such, ean consult Dr. Arthur L. Kinne,
who is in charge of the Pre-school and Nutrition Clinie, every
Thursday afternoon from three to four o’eloek. In these
elinies, children were examined and were found to
need treatment.

We cannot show our thankful appreciation of the gra  tuitous services of the many who would fall within this list;
but especially do we feel constrained to mention again the
generosity of the proprietors of the sub-stations which are
lovated in the following order: ,
 Hebert’s Drug Store, at the corner of Center aud Ely

Streets.

 Shea’s News Room, corner Hampden and Maple Streets.

 Oakdale Pharmacy, at corner of Sargeant Street and
Magnolia Avenue, Oakdale.
 Geissler’s Grocery, Vernon Street, Springdale.
 Muskat’s Groeery, Appleton Street.

The paid workers include the Supervising Nurse, Station
Nurse, three untrained assistants and the Pre-natal Nurse.

To the faithful services of these, especially, we attribute
such measure of suss as this report indieates, and here
Wish to express publicly our appreciation of the same.

A branch of extension work which we suggest as necessary and which ean well be undertaken at an early date  s
the opening of dental econferenee for children. As our
headquarters at the milk station are recognized as the echild| ren's health center, this work should be included, particularly
as the city in its other departments or private organizations
furnishes no dental care to its children.

“Great Expectations,’? might. be the eorreet position
whieh we hold to date on the question of new building for
headquarters. We have faith in the promises for state reeognition of Child Welfare Department of the city of
Holvoke and the appropriation of funds for the purpose of
housing the work as it deserves and as its growing needs
demand.
