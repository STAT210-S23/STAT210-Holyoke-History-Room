  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.
SEWERS.
Considerable work has been done in the Sewer Department.
The Highland sewer system, so called, that has been under consideration for some years, has been constructed. This system
differs from the other sewer systems of the city in its being con, structed on the “separate” and not on the “combined plan. ,
That is, it is constructed to convey and discharge house and roof
drainage only, wherein the “combined plan not only conveys
and discharges house and roof drainage but also street or surface
drainage as well. |
Why the separate system has been adopted in the Highland
territory was not from its being considered the better system of
the two, but solely from an economic standpoint, the separate |
system being the most economical one on account of the distance |
the sewage proper had to be conveyed, which could not be disposed of at any point nearer to the territory sewered than the
Connecticut River. |
Another new feature introduced into the system, which has
not been used before in any of the other sewerage systems of the
city, is the construction of sewers, having no house connections, |
to work under pressure. |
This has been done especially in the case of the trunk sewer
running from Pleasant street through the Dingle to the Connecticut River.
The distance between these two points is about two thousand ,
' feet, and the profile of the ground along the course of the sewer
is anything but an incline plane.
For the first twelve hundred feet or so from Pleasant street
the ground falls on an average of about one hundred and thirty
feet, while the remaining distance, which is across the island, so
called, to the river, is perfectly flat having no fall whatever. |
Under these conditions, your Engineer advised that sewer
be built to work under pressure, and recommended cast iron
pipe inches in diameter.
The idea of having trunk sewer only inches in diameter
together with the method adopted to solve rather peculiar

problem, has caused more or less criticism, as the public in general
cannot understand how sewer of this size working under pressure can have discharging capacity equal to sewer inches
in diameter laid in the same ditch in the usual way, that is not
under pressure.

The total cost of construction of the system was the comparatively small sum of This does not include the
amounts paid for land purchased for sewer and park purposes.

For the several sewers of the system together with their |
details see the following tabulated list of sewers and also plans
and profiles on file in the office of the City Engineer. :

The trunk sewer of the proposed Ingleside sewer system has
also been constructed by the laying of  -inch vitrified pipe in
Ferry street, from the river to Springfield street, and  -inch
vitrified pipe in Springfield street from Ferry street northerly to
St. Vincent street. The total cost of this work was  or
about  per foot. |

A  -inch vitrified pipe was laid in Railroad street from the
sewer in Appleton street northerly to the alley in the rear of
Appleton and Division streets, thence in the said alley to the
alley east of High street.

The  -inch sewer in the alley in the rear of Maple and
Chestnut streets, between Dwight and Suffolk streets, was
extended northerly for distance of feet to the Lyman Mills
property. |

In Sycamore street, at Franklin street, the sewer was extended southerly for distance of feet. :

po The View street sewer was extended by  -inch vitrified

| pipe through and across Northampton street to Longwood |
avenue, thence westerly in Longwood avenue for distance of

| feet.

The dry weather flow of the Walnut street system should be
diverted into the Front street sewer the coming year in the
manner recommended in previous report of this department.

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.
A storm water sewer should be added to the Walnut street !
and portion of the Front street systems to relieve some of the !
sewers which occasionally become surcharged in these systems. |
Below are tabulated lists of the sewers and catch basins ,
built during the year. |

The re-location and construction of South Main street
between South street and Springdale avenue referred to in the
City Engineer’s report of  had been completed in the early
summer. This work has met with the approval of all citizens and
the street now is, what it never was before, passable at all times,
its grade being above the highest water mark of the river for
fifteen years. The total cost of this work was |
Race street from Dwight street to Cabot street, Bond street
from Appleton street to Cabot street and Elm street from Prospect street to Lyman street have been macadamized. The westerly side of Main street from Appleton street to Sargeant street
has been paved with Creo-resinate wood block. |
e

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.  

This pavement was laid by contract and cost  per
square yard. The City did the necessary excavating and prepared
the foundation to subgrade upon which was laid the five inch
concrete base for the wood block. |

A portion of the granite blocks replaced by the wood block
pavement were relaid on the northerly side of Appleton street
from Bowers street easterly to the Boston Maine R. R. Co.
branch tracks east of Winter street and on Sargeant street
between the first level canal and Commercial street. The cost
of these pavements per square yard was as follows:

BRIDGES.

The Dwight street foot bridge, on account of its great vibration, was causing so much uneasiness to the public, as to its safety,
that it was considered advisable to stiffen and strengthen the
structure.

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.

This was done by adding to it two wooden piers, thus
dividing the structure into three spans. Since the work, which
cost was done, no fears have been expressed by those
using the bridge regarding its safety.

All the other metal bridges of the city are in fair condition
considering the length of time some of them have been in service. ;
Ilowever it would be advisable to replace some of the weaker ones |
by more modern structures, as there is no knowledge, scientific or !
otherwise, can vouch for the life of an old bridge.

PARK AND MUNICIPAL LIGHTING DEPARTMENTS.

With the growth and expansion of the city the subject of
our public parks is rapidly gaining in importance. The wise
and efficient policy of the Park Commission for the improvement,
development and extension of the parks is, however, causing an

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.  

increased demand for the services of the Engineering Department.

Besides the field work of the engineers on the various parks

during the past year the department has furnished studies and

detail drawings for the stone steps and buttresses at the northwest

and southwest corners of Canonchet Park and also drawings of
the terrace wall and outlooks proposed for Prospect Park.

, The situation is much the same concerning the increasing
demand for engineering service from various other departments,
and especially is this true regarding the Municipal Lighting
Department, and with the growth and development of the
hghting system this must necessarily continue to be the case.

SEWER MAPS. |

Last year the department prepared large map of the entire
city showing complete plan of our sewers as far as we have any
record of them.

This year we have commenced series of detail maps made
to uniform scale of forty feet to the inch. These maps are
made on heavy drawing paper mounted on muslin, to be in book
form in volumes of convenient size for ready reference. It is
intended to make these maps very complete record not only of
the sewers, but of all pipes and conduits in the streets.

WATER WORKS. |

The High Service Reservoir, in course of construction since
 has been completed during the year. This work, it is
assumed, will be referred to in the report of the Water Commissioners, hence it is unnecessary to enter into any description
of it here.

It is not generally understood by the public at large, what
are the requirements of the Water Works department from
an engineering standpoint, or that the engineering work
here is at least fully as much as in all the other departments of
the city. The major part of your Engineer’s time is given to it, :

  "REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.
and the problems to be solved are certainly not growing less numerous or less difficult from year to year.

There is no question of greater importance confronting the |
municipalities of the country at the present time, than that of |
municipal water supply, upon which the health of the community |
so much depends.

Neither is there any question that demands the attention of
the municipalities more than this. Water boards, or commissions
of municipal water supply, nowadays, are not only confronted ,
with the oftentimes difficult problem of furnishing bountiful
supply of wholesome water, but with the more difficult one of
how to prevent extravagant waste. ‘

The tendency of extravagant waste, especially in communities where water is not supplied by measure, is rapidly growing,
and Holyoke is no exception to the rule. Here the consumption
according to the returns of the large meters installed by the
Water Commissioners within the last month, has reached the
very large figures of gallons per capita per day.

This large consumption is not caused either, as some might
think, by our manufacturing establishments, as all the water used
by these is metered and amounts only to about gallons per
capita per day.

If this large consumption is not checked and kept within
a more reasonable limit, new storage capacity will have to be
provided in the near future, and also the carrying capacity of the
pipe system increased, if our fire protection is to be maintained.

The consumption in this city, including water for all purposes, should not exd gallons per capita per day. Even
this is high consumption, if we eompare it with other cities in
the state given in the following table compiled from the State
Board of Health, Report.

old offenders. We have had a-large number of neglected children during the past year. Ten of those little ones were committed to the care of State Board of Charity, eight were placed at
Mount Saint Vincent, and the others were provided with suitable
homes. |

  REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF POLICE.

Five wayward girls and one woman were placed in the
care of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd at Springfield, giving
them an opportunity to reform and at the same time saving them
from prison record.

I would again remind the charitably inclined, that would be thankful for donations of clothing and shoes, as have many
applications for assistance at this time of year. thank those ;
who have responded to this request, and also thank the ladies
of the Needle-work Guild” for their generous donations of new
garments. |

I desire to thank the Marshal and his assistants and the
members of the force, for their courteous co-operation and ready
assistance in my work.

Respectfully submitted,

SIGNAL SYSTEM.

It is most sincerely hoped by all members of this Department that Gamwell system be adopted the coming year; this
matter has been postponed year after year with City and Department increasing in size. Practically every city in this state is
supplied with this system or one similar.

The following is the record of the one now in use:

  REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF POLICE.
, DEPORTMENT.
The general deportment of the members of this department
is good. There have been but few occasions to call the officers
toacts of carelessness during the year. Visitors to the city often
compliment the general good order that prevails, which speaks
well for the work of the police in this city with large mixed
population. am sure the force as whole will compare favor- {
ably with any in this commonwealth. ,
RECOMMENDATIONS.
Again it is urged that the office of Inspector be created. The
: additional expense means only an increase of the salary of the
officer selected, as this work has been performed by patrolmen,
who have devoted their whole time to this branch of the service
for several years with excellent results. They are often sent to
other departments where the fact of his being regularly appointed inspector would aid him. slight increase in salary
would compensate, in measure, for extra expense ke is obliged
to incur in the discharge of his duties. !
CONCLUSION.
I again wish to tender my sincere thanks to the Hon.
Edward W. Chapin, Justice of the Police Court, his associates
and Clerk of the Court, Thomas J. Tierney, for the kindly manner in which they have aided this department. 
To his honor, Mayor Arthur B. Chapin, take this oppor: tunity to again thank him for his uniform courtesy and consideration.
Respectfully submitted,
J. SIDNEY WRIGHT,
City Marshal.

REPORT OF THE
Gas and Electric Department. |
City oF HoLyoxkg, Mass.
OFrFicE or Gas anp Execrric Dept.
December .
To the Honorable the Mayor and the Board of Aldermen.

 GerntLemMEN:—I hand you herewith the second annual
report of the Gas and Electric Department. The past year has
been one of progress both in getting the lighting plants into good
working condition and in the amount of new business acquired.
The reduction in the price of gas May diminished the receipts
from the sale of gas at the rate of over  per year so that
for four months they were less than those for the corresponding
months of  but in the fifth month after the reduction, owing
to the increased amount of gas sold, they exded those of the
previous year. The sales of tar have fallen off and owing to the
condition of the tar market the price had to be reduced, so the
receipts from the sales have fallen behind. The sales of coke
continued satisfactory. The expense of repairs has been heavy.
Both plants when the city took them needed extensive repairs,
but for the first year only the most pressing needs were taken
care of. This year thorough repairs have been made, making a
seemingly excessive account. At the gas works there have been
two benches of retorts rebuilt, the floor of the retort house
relaid, the water gas apparatus relined and some of the fittings
on it replaced, the roofs put into proper shape, new wash room
with forty lockers and shower bath and closets for the men has
been built, room for the new shavings scrubber has been made
out of the old wash room, the scrubber installed, new drum put

  GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT.

into the station meter doubling its capacity, the No. gas holder

has been painted, together with numerous minor repairs and

painting. The street mains have had the usual overhauling for

leaks. Atthe electric station the gravel roofing has been replaced

by anew one and the necessary repairs and painting on the
buildings have been done.

December there were miles of street mains
laid and gas meters in service. During this year, there has
been laid feet of pipe with feet of small pipe abandoned ,

 making total of miles of main in service. There have
been set meters, making total of meters in use in the
city, gain in the number of per cent. There have been
laid new service pipes.

The changes at the electric station that were underway a
year ago have all been completed. There are now installed two
  Kilowatt generators with their accompanying switchboards
bearing the necessary switches, indicating and recording instruments and current regulator. The work is now being done of
putting in foundations for the Kilowatt generator contracted
for the past summer. This should be in running order by January
 After much investigation and deliberation, it was thought
best in the proposed addition to the station, authorized November
 to install turbine-generator set of Kilowatt capacity.
While the installation of steam turbine instead of reciprocating
engine is move out of the beaten track of steam engine practice,
its introduction in electric stations is becoming more and more
general, and its success is so pronounced that this installation
seemed the best one to make for the city. This machine will
probably be installed and run next May. When all the proposed
apparatus is installed, the city will have station capable of
delivering horse power with water and steam combined,
giving margin for several year’s growth without any considerable further outlay of money, unless an unforseen amount of business develops. The prospects of increased business are very
good both in lighting and power. The department has engaged
to furnish within the next five months over horse power in
current in addition to that already being furnished. At the

. GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT.  
present time the station is using about horse power, so it
can readily be seen these additions were necessary.

Besides the changes at the station, the work of overhauling,
changing and extending the lines of poles and wires through the
city has been completed. There are now installed street arc
lights, fifteen C. P. and twenty-four C. P. electric incandes cent lamps. There are set poles carrying miles of main
wire. There are customers using electricity, of which are
using it for power. This is an increase in the number of  or
  per cent.

In my report for  recommended the acquiring of the
necessary land for and the construction of new gas holder.
The increased business of the past year has emphasized the need
of it. The send-out of gas at the present season is averaging .
  cubic feet of gas for each working day, with maximum
send-out of feet. With storage capacity of less than
  cubic feet, and with the number of chances of accidents
happening at the gas works stopping or curtailing the make of
gas, it is an unsafe condition to work under. If an exhauster
breaks, steam or an oil pump goes to pieces, steam engine or

' fan blower gives out, or if the larger accident of an explosion
should occur, there would be no alternative but that the city
would be without gas for an indefinite period. recommend and |
urge most strongly that immediate action be taken authorizing the

department to take the necessary steps for the construction of a
new holder. In placing additional boilers at the electric station,
the space used for storing coal will have to be used for them.
New storage must be provided. recommend that the department be authorized to build coal shed.

gas works.

FREDERICK  S. FULLER,
Dec. Public Accountant.
It will be seen from the above statement the gas works
show profit of only  as against  for year ago. |
This decrease can be explained first by the reduction in the :
price of gas, second by the reduction in the price of tar and the |
smaller sales of it, and by the increased bill for repairs.
The electric station shows profit of  as against a
loss of  for the previous year. It would seem due the
city, whereas the recent reduction in metered lighting service
will reduce the station’s receipts about  for the year, that
it have the remaining  as reduction in the price of its
 gtreet lights. Commencing with December the department will charge the city  per street arc light instead of
$  as heretofore.

To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen: :

I have the honor to submit herewith the following report as
Inspector of Milk, Vinegar and Petroleum for the City of Holyoke for the year ending November  th,  .

  INSPECTOR OF MILK, VINEGAR AND PETROLEUM.

Making the total number of quarts of sweet milk  ,
of skimmed milk and of cream sold this past
year, which at the retail value of milk and cream as sold in this
city amounts to .

Number of milk samples tested ..  :
Number of butter samples tested  .
Number of vinegar samples tested  .
Number of kerosene oil samples tested  
Number of prosecutions,  
Number of warnings sent, milk,  :
Number of warnings sent, kerosene,  

The prosecutions were, two for selling milk not of good
standard quality; both were found guilty. One case was placed
on file and the other, the fine was The third case was for
selling vinegar and the party was fined .

Of the samples of milk tested only were of .such
low standard as to deserve warning.

I have had complaints from several parties claiming that
their milk was bad and caused sickness, but upon investigation
I found that the fault was with the parties themselves, caused by
improper handling after receiving it.

The condition of the peddlers’ wagons is now very good as
a rule and there are only few that do not seem to try to keep
them clean. The stores are keeping their milk in better shape
now, but there is chance for improvement. The way to buy
milk from store is in glass bottles.

In my report last year recommended that the Board of
Health make rule prohibiting the use of wooden plugs as a
cover for milk cans; this they did at meeting held April  nd,
giving the peddlers until July  th to comply with the same.
This rule has been complied with and lived up to, so the wooden
cover for milk can is thing of the past for this city.

I have visited, by request of Wealth Officer Linehan, several
places where there were contagious diseases to ascertain if the

INSPECTOR OF MILK, VINEGAR AND PETROLEUM.  
causes of the disease could be traced to the milk, but in no case
could find the milk responsible.

I have been with the Health Officer on some other cases and
he has helped me on many others.

Early in September my Babcock milk tester broke down for
the third time and as it was worn out, made it necessary to have
anew one. It was decided by the Board of Health that larger
and better one was needed and the result was the obtaining  
bottle tester to be operated by electric power, made to order.
The machine is the only one of its kind and is working perfectly.

VINEGAR.

I have tested samples of vinegar and found only one
below the standard. The party selling this was fined  in
the Police Court.

OLEOMARGARINE.

I have issued but one license (peddler) for the sale of oleomargarine, and have received but one complaint, and that for
renovated butter, which on test proved to be straight butter.

PETROLEUM.

I have tested samples from tank cars of kerosene oil and
  samples taken from stores and tank wagons. found in some
of the stores and tank wagons oil that would not stand the test
the law requires, and that it was obtained from parties that did
not have their oil tested by me before selling same. sent warnings to seven parties, and they discontinued the sale of said oil.

I do not think that there is any kerosene sold in the city
now, but will stand the test.

I was sent for to take sample of oil that had been bought
from peddler. On examination found it to be naphtha. The

) party had used it in an oil heater with the natural result,

  INSPECTOR OF MILK, VINEGAR AND PETROLEUM.
that it took fire and required the services of the Chemical{to’extinguish it.

People cannot be too careful in the using of kerosene and
naphtha.

I have had great assistance from the Health Officer and the
Board of Health, also from my Collector of Samples.

I thank the City Marshal and the patrolmen for the help
they have given me.
| Respectfully submitted,

JAMES K. MORRILL,
| Inspector of Milk and Vinegar.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE
PARK COMMISSIONERS
To His Honor the Mayor and Board of Aldermen:

GENTLEMEN The time is again at hand for this board to
render an account of their doings for the past year and agreeable
to the provisions of the statutes, we beg herewith to present for
your acceptance and consideration brief resumé of the work
done and the present condition of the parks under our jurisdiction, together with full account of the expenditures for the
past year. Our report must of necessity be brief from the fact,
that outside of the general care of the parks no work of great
importance has been accomplished owing to lack of funds, no
provision having been made at the beginning of the financial
year for the necessary funds to enable us to do any development
work of any description, much to our regret and disappointment.

 We have however, accomplished one important piece of
work and that is the completion of the entrances to Canonchet
Park. Here we have provided granite steps at both the north
and southwest corners; thus completing the four corners. It is
the intention of the board to continue work on this park in the
spring by completing the remaining concrete walks in the park
and the finishing of terrace on the west side. When this work
is accomplished then we shall have this small park in as good a
condition as it is possible to make it. The new fountain has been
erected and is notable addition, helping much to beautify the
grounds as well as furnishing generous supply of good drinking water to the many patrons of the place. It is hoped to secure
the co-operation of the Board of Public Works in placing curbing

|
t
; REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS.
and good concrete walks around the four sides bordering on the
| public streets. When these improvements are completed then
| we shall have very pretty and attractive park for this section ;
: although it is to be regretted that it is not larger. Nothing further has been done in the way of improvements or additions to
| Hampden, Germania or Hamilton Parks. All of the above have
| received the necessary care and attention and are in excellent
! condition. Prospect park requires considerable attention in the
: way of new walks, addition to the children’s playgrounds, ete.
| This departure seems to be source of much pleasure as attested
| by the increased use of same. Better police service should be
given to this portion of the park, as it is infested by gang of
hoodlums after the parks are closed for the night, who destroy
much property and break the children’s swings. The tank house
. has been put in good repair; new concrete floor has been sub| stituted for the wooden one, being great improvement. The
| public sanitary and shelter for women has fully demonstrated its
| usefulness and is attested by the many people who take advantage
of it. It is kept in excellent order and courteous service rendered
by the lady attendant in charge. It is the desire of this board to
commence the coming year the erection of stone parapet wall,
with outlooks, to take the place of the unsightly and unstaple
wooden fence now there. We believe that this would add greatly
to the appearance of the park as well as being better safeguard
to the many children who visit the place. It is the intention to
erect certain portion every year until all is completed. This
would make the banks adjoining the railroad tracks in more
presentable condition and add much to the beauty of the place.
This is one of the most important works we have under contemplation.
The development of Elmwood park has again been postponed owing to lack of funds. We have had plans made for
| this important work for over year and it is much to be regretted |
that some progress could not have been made in the past year.
Provision should be made for the extension of the culvert up to
Pine street, where it  intended to bridge the ravine by sub—— —

will be welcomed by the many who have occasion to travel from
this section to Elmwood, and it is earnestly hoped that the necessary funds will be at our disposal that will enable us to undertake this very important work and to prod with the development and finishing of the first section of the park according to
plan already provided by the landscape artist. Following is a
complete record of our receipts and disbursements for the past
year together with detailed statement of our expenditures:

RECOMMENDATIONS.

We again strongly urge that provisions should be made to
enable this Board to make purchase of land for extension of our
already very limited park area. This city is growing fast and
more land is needed for park purpose; instead of keeping ahead

| we are going backwards. This one important matter is being

taken up by all other cities and we should do the same while

land is available. The southern portion of the city is badly in

need of larger areasas well asin the north eastern section. Playgrounds should be provided in different sections of the city.

No better investment could be made by the city than the purchase of. land for such purposes yearly. The time is soon coming

when land will not be available at any price and advantage

should be taken of any opportunity to secure such portions as

can be purchased. We therefore recommend that Park Loan

be authorized for purchase of lands. 

 For care and maintenance of present park areas,  

- For development of Elmwood Park,  

For completion of Canonchet Park,  

| For improvements and additions to Prospect Park,  
oo 

REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS.  
In conclusion we can only add the necessity of giving due
consideration to the foregoing suggestions which we consider
 urgent for the best interests of our city and for our citizens who
have the best wishes for the welfare of our city at heart. We
respectfully submit the foregoing for your consideration and
approval.

- REPORT OF THE |
BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.
a City oF HotyoxE, Mass.
OFFICE THE BoarpD oF PusBLic Works, :
DEcEMBER .
To the Honorable the Mayor and the Members of the Board of
Aldermen of the City of Holyoke, Massachusetts.

Sirs :—Herewith we present the eighth annual report of the
Department of Public Works for the fiscal year ending November |

The future needs of the department are many but the most
urgent necessity is the improvement of our streets and roads.
For this too much cannot be said and too little interest has been

; shown by our citizens in general. We believe that seventy-five
thousand dollars ($ should be expended the coming year
in permanent highway work. The immediate locations to be
benefitted must be selected later according to their pressing

requirements.

It is believed that the bituminous macadam pavement should
be extended and that much work in macadamizing ought to be
done. Permanent forms of roadways on our principal streets
must be provided to save the streets from ruin and to provide a
safe and lasting surface to sustain the travel over them. The
demands of the modern vehicle require that immediate attention
be given these thoroughfares. .

The first creo-resinate wood block pavement to be laid in
the city was placed on the west side of Main street, from Apple  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.

ton to Sargeant streets, last summer. This block replaced the
granite pavement in this location. With us it is yet matter of
experiment. We have had no complaints concerning its being
slippery in excess of brick pavements. We believe the wisdom
of the selection will be proven in time.

The granite blocks taken from Main street were laid on the
north side of Appleton street, between Bowers street and Winters
street, and on Sargeant street between the first level canal and
Commercial street.

Many streets were re-surfaced with macadam, chief among

| them being that portion of the Springfield road south of Berkshire
street which was re-located; Race street from Dwight street to
Cabot street and Bond street along its entire length. ,

In all, satisfactory work has been carried out on the high-,
ways the past year, and if, as we hope, an appropriation of seventyfive thousand dollars ($ can be made the coming year,
work already started will be completed and much new work added.

We should like to see more lively interest taken in our
streets and roadways by our citizens and taxpayers, and the
organization of associations having in mind the improvement and
beautifying of our city should be encouraged, as it is only by the
unreserved co-operation of all citizens working forthe one end .

 that we can hope to have the “city beautiful.” In this we are
pleased to note growing sentiment.

We would recommend the construction of surface water
sewer for the section north of Appleton street between School
street and Maple street or Chestnut street, which sewer could be
discharged into the Connecticut river at point near the outlet
of the present Walnut street system. We also advise discharging
the ordinary flow of the Walnut street sewer into the Front street
system by following out the plans proposed by this department
some years ago.

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.  

A much needed work was done the past year in providing  
system of sewers for Ingleside and section of the Highlands
north of Highland avenue and east of Nonotuck street. These
sections are now well provided for with few exceptions. At
the present writing storm water sewer is being constructed in

| Northampton street from Morgan street to the Northampton line,
and in River terrace from Northampton street to the Dingle, so
called. The sewer at Ingleside might well be extended northerly
a short distance, but this can wait year if necessary.

A departure has been made the past year in the sidewalk
department, by the purchase of construction plant by the city
and the laying of our own concrete walks. Much more satisfactory work has been done. The cost has been somewhat in excess
of contract work, as better grade of material has been used and
the compositions made richer. This method of construction will
be carried out in the future. |

. There yet remains large amount of new walks to be built,
while the repair work increases yearly, which will require larger
appropriation the coming year.

For the doing away of the present unsuitable, defective and
inadequate buildings at the City Yard and for the erection of a
modern, safe and convenient structure we urge an appropriation
of twenty thousand dollars ($ ). This is one of the most \
pressing needs of the department and an inspection of the present |
buildings and “sheds” will substantiate it. ,

Material and lasting alterations have been made in the
stables at the Relief and Elmwood engine houses and much other

routine work has been done upon the public buildings, particularly
the City Hall building, which has now been, to great extent,
wired for electric lighting, and the Treasurer’s office thoroughly
re-modeled.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.

The needs of the city property remain unchanged. The
constant repair work must go on in all of our buildings. In the
City Hall building improvements must be made in the main hall,
necessitating the expenditure of sizable amount.

The growth of the city has entailed greater expense on
the Alley Department. We repeat the recommendations made
last year. We hope for closer fellowship between tenants and
property owners and the Board. We urge the advantages of
greater efforts in improving the conditions of our alleys and discountenance the promiscuous dumping of waste papers, ashes and
other debris into these alleys without proper receptacles.

You will find hereto annexed exhibits showing the work in
detail performed in each department the past year.

Respectfully submitted,
Board of Public Works.

REPORT OF CITY SOLICITOR.
To the Honorable, the Mayor of the City of Holyoke:
I respectfully submit the report of the law department for
the year ending December .
At the beginning of the year the pending litigation was as
follows:
George W. Richards vs. City of Holyoke.
T. W. Mann vs. City of Holyoke.
Lyman Mills vs. City of Holyoke, being five cases including protest for three years in which appeals

City of Boston va. City of Holyoke.
Bridget Shine vs. City of Holyoke.
Amelia Sterling vs. City of Holyoke.
City of Holyoke vs. Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

Aaron Hamilton vs. City of Holyoke.

state. The Commonwealth contended that it was not liable .
because it ordered the City to discontinue aid. The City claimed
that so iong as the Commonwealth did not remove the person
that the City was obliged to give aid so long as it was needed.
The case was tried in the Superior Court, Suffolk county, and
was decided in favor of the City.

The Lyman Mills Cases.

The most important event of the year in the Jegal department was the final settlement of the Lyman Mills Tax cases. In
  the Lyman Mills petitioned for an abatement of taxes objecting to valuation of This case was referred to
a commissioner, Mr. Arthur Lord of Boston, before whom it
was tried. On July the commissioner filed his report
in the Superior Court of Hampden County in which he decided
that the valuation of the assessors was not excessive and found .
for the City of Holyoke as respondent. In September  the
case was tried in the Superior Court at Springfield before Justice
Henry M. Sheldon. On December Justice Sheldon filed
his finding, rulings and order for judgment in which he found
upon the evidence before the commissioner that there was no overvaluation of either the land, the buildings or the machinery and
that the petitioner is not entitled to any abatement and that the
petition be dismissed with expenses and costs. To this finding
the petitioner filed exceptions, thus appealing the case to the

, Supreme Court. In addition to the petition for the Lyman
Mils had made protest or filed petitions for each year following
up to  making eight cases in all.

During the year counsel for the parties with the
assessors and representatives of the Lyman Mills had several
conferences looking toward settlement of all the cases and on
October the entire matter was finally adjusted as follows:

The finding of the Court in the case was aftirmed. In
all the subsequent cases judgment was entered in favor of the
City. The valuation for and remained unchanged and

for the six years from to an abatement of  with
an allowance for costs was given. The valuation for was

REPORT OF CITY SOLICITOR.  

- fixed at It is most fortunate thing for the city that
this long dispute is now adjusted and much credit is due the
respective parties including the assessors and officials of both city :
and company for the fairness and good judgment shown in thus
reaching an agreement. The city is greatly indebted to William 
H. Brooks, senior counsel, for the masterly skill displayed by him
in the handling of this litigation.

Thomas W. Mann vs. City of Holyoke.

During the year this case was argued and on November  ,
 the Auditor, Mr. John C. Hammond, filed his report in the
Superior Court of Hampden County.

This action was brought to recover  for expert
work done in connection with the Lyman Mills tax case. It had
been pending for long time. The Auditor found that the plaintiff was entitled to recover as follows:

For services, . 
Two days attendance in Court,  
———— 
Less payment,  
Total, . 
To this is added interest from June .
Henry Potter vs. City of Holyoke.
Aaron Hamilton vs. City of Holyoke. |
Charles Hamilton vs. City of Holyoke.
M. Steinert Sons Co. vs. City of Holyoke.

These cases were actions of tort brought by writs dated
May for injuries and damage arising out of an accident
which happened on the Springfield road below the dry bridge on
April The accident arose because of an alleged defect
in the road caused by raising the grade of the road and it resulted
in the tipping over of wagon loaded with concert grand
piano. The piano was damaged and the three men on the wagon

were injured. The cases were assigned for trial for November

 th, but on that day the plaintiffs asked for continuance on

basis of the illness of their principal witness. After some conference the four cases were finally settled by the payment of
. "$ .

With the exception of the Mann” case the pending cases
are as follows:

City of Boston vs. City of Holyoke.

This action is for money paid by the city of Boston for the
care of diphtheria patients who had settlements in Holyoke.
The amount involved is .

Town of Hardwick vs. City of Holyoke.

This is an action brought by writ dated August ,
returnable to the Superior Court of Worcester county.

The action is brought to recover for money paid by the
town of Hardwick for the care of small pox patients having
settlements in Holyoke.

City of Holyoke vs. Stella Clement.

This is bill in equity brought to recover for money paid by
the city of Holyoke for the care and support of the defendant.
The venue is laid in Hampshire county, the notice being
returnable before the Superior Court the first Monday of November. The amount involved is about .

With the exception of the case of T. W. Mann the city is
entirely free from serious litigation of any kind and there are no
pending tort or negligence actions whatever.

I desire to express my gratitude to all the departments of the
city for their unfailing courtesy and helpfulness.

Respectfully submitted,
N. P. AVERY,
Holyoke, Mass., Dec. City Solicitor.
