  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER
CITY SOLICITOR.

Plans for accident cases and descriptions of properties
transferred were prepared’in this department for the City

 Solicitor.
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

Maps showing the patrolmen’s night and day beats were
prepared in this department during the year.

, FIRE DEPARTMENT. |

Maps were made showing the fire district, location of
water mains and hydrants, and maps showing the location
of the Street Railway crossings on High street.

PARK DEPARTMENT.

This department prepared plans and specifications for steps
in Elmwood Park and for the layout and development of
Laurel Street Park.

STREET NUMBERS.

The usual assignment of street numbers has been made
during the year. .

GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT.

Plans were made for an additional story to be built on
the Wheel House at the Electric Light Station.

The new addition to the Gas Plant occupied much of
-the time of the Engineering Department during the tearing
down and reconstruction.

Work on the Coal Pocket is practically finished with the
exception of the roof, which ts being covered with Hyrib metal
lath. It is not expected that the concrete roof can be placed
until warmer weather ts assured.

The foundations of the Retort House are completed and
the erection of the steel work is progressing rapidly. It will
be several months before the building  ready for the roof.

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER  
The work of dismantling the Condenser Ifouse has begun
and as soon as the excavation is completed the concrete foundations for the machinery in the building will be laid.

Specifications for electric conduits to be laid in Bond,
Dwight, High, Cabot, essex, Appleton, Suffolk and Hampden
streets, were preparcd in this office during the year.

DEVELOPMENT OF SUBURBS.

No more opportune time than the present could be selected
for the consideration of the big problems coincident with the
growth of our city.

With the development of the Connecticut River, Holyoke,
on account of her location, must necessarily become the head
of navigation and as such will be the distributing point for an
extensive territory.

With cheaper freight rates, we shall be placed in more
favorable position for the advancement of present and future
industries.

Most of the large seaports of the Old World are located
as far from the sea coast as is Holyoke. We may then in all
reason assume that our city’s growth will be rapid when navigation of the Connecticut River becomes reality.

Big problems will be presented to us in the near future
among which the planning of Greater Holyoke will claim a
large share of attention.

The planning of undeveloped territory in the suburban
districts should therefore not be left to the haphazard methods
of land promoting companies.

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER  

Since the passage of the ordinance of which provides
for adequate light and ventilation in tenement buildings, a
great advance has been made in the character of these structures.

To bring about the improvement of buildings not up to
modern standards, will require full co-operation on the part
of the owners. Several owners have consulted me with the
view of remodeling old buildings. ;

Of course in considering any ordinance covering this class
of buildings, the rights of property owners must be regarded.

ELECTRIC WIRING.

Since the Inspection Department was established four
years ago, the standard of our electric wiring has gradually
improved. In general our wiring now compares favorably with
that of any city in New England. Old wiring is being gradually
brought up to the standard requirements, and many installations which were found in defective or dangerous condition
have been corrected.

The local inspection has had the commendation of the
officers of the New England Insurance I:xchange.

The number of specifications filed during the year were...

Number of inspections on old installations............  

Specifications have been prepared for electric wiring in the
Relief Engine House, Mt. Tom [Engine House, ItImwood Engine

REPORT OF THE
Fire Commissioners .
Office of Fire Commissioners, |
Holyoke Mass., December .
To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen: .
Gentlemen:—We respectfully submit you the report of :
the Fire Department for the year ending December |
The Board met January and organized by the elec- :
tion of Philip M. Judd as chairman, and George C. Robert as
vice-chairman, and John Hildreth, as secretary.
There have been fires and alarms during the past year.
This is alarms more than last year, with loss on the buildings amounting to  and loss of  on the
contents, making total loss of which is much
larger amount than the department has had for long time.
There have been some very serious fires this past year,
namely, The Smith Tablet Co., the Wagner Spring Bed Co.,
and the fire in the Felix J. Cloutier block. These three fires
were responsible for the loss of over .
It has been very busy year for the department and the
Commissioners congratulate the citizens upon the splendid
work that the fire department has accomplished during the past
year.
As the years pass by, the Commissioners are more and more
impressed with the dangers confronting the fireman in the performance of his duties. During the past year, Mr. William J.
Millane received such serious injuries at fire, that he was laid
up for over three months, and while responding to call on
September  th, First Assistant Chief Reilly was so severely |

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS  
injured by collision with Hose Wagon No.  that he died
a few hours afterwards. In the death of Assistant Chief Reilly,
the department and the City loses valuable man; he was
exdingly well fitted to act as Assistant Chief of the fire department, as he possessed the confidence and esteem of both the
men and the officers in the department; he was valiant firefighter and always led his men to the thick of the fight; he has
been many times injured during the past few years; he was a
man of strong physique and splendid courage, and his judgment in fighting fires was of the best; the Commissioners personally feel that they have lost man whom they could ill
spare and that the City is the poorer by his death; it would
seem to the Commissioners that it would be good thing if the.
Citizens should take some steps to properly provide for the
widow and children of this valiant firefighter, and we hope in
the very near future this matter may be taken up by our
Citizens, as we have no provisions in the charter for such cases,
and it would seem to us that the services rendered by Mr. Reilly are such as ought to guarantee the care of his widow
and children until they are able to take care of themselves.

Our report shows that the property endangered by fire
was over thirteen millions of dollars, and the insurance upon
the property was nearly five millions of dollars; that the
insurance companies paid that there is pending a
loss amounting to over  and this would leave net loss to :
our citizens over and above the amount actually paid about
$ little less than  per fire above the insurance.

We wish to thank you for making the changes in the Elmwood Engine House, which makes this one of the best equipped
houses in the City and we sincerely trust that all of the houses
may be changed, so that the men can have separate sleeping
apartments.

We regret that Hugh McCoy lost his life during the past
year from fire caused by the explosion of kerosene lamp.

The careless use of matches is responsible for fires and
soot in chimney for fires and would seem as though that it

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS
would be good plan to have the chimneys in the City cleaned
out occasionally and not have the Fire Department called out
so many times during the year to put out fires in chimneys.
Eighty-eight fires were set by boys, one more than last :
year. We took occasion last year to draw attention to the :
extraordinary number of fires that were sct by boys, and we
ask that the parents and teachers impress upon their children
the great wrong that they do by setting fires to the woods and
rubbish that are always lying around more or less. Some of :
the most serious fires of the last year have been set by boys. ,
We are satisfied that the time will soon come when all the
apparatus in the fire department will be motor-driven and we :
hope that as fast as possible this may be accomplished in our ,
department, as the use of motor-driven apparatus enable us to .
get to the fire before it becomes serious and the first few minutes }
determines whether the fire will be put out with comparatively |
little loss or heavy loss. .
We draw your attention to the recommendations that we
make, especially to the recommendations regarding the headquarters, the purchase of automobiles and the addition of new
men to the department and we thank your Honorable Mayor |
and City Council for your liberality to your Commissioners
and assure you that we have done the very best we could in the
economical expenditures of the appropriations made us.
In making the appropriations for the coming year, we ask
your careful consideration to the following recommendations,
some of which have been made for so many years, that they are
getting stale, but the necessity is there as much as ever.
First. —The conditions at the High Street Engine House
continue to be very unsatisfactory. The men at this house
have to attend all the fires and their work is very arduous
and they should have decent sleeping accommodations which
they do not now have. They are crowded together in such a
manner as to make it impossible for some of them to get the
rest that they should have. We have changed over the Highland and Elmwood Engine Houses, so as to give the men ,

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS  
separate sleeping apartments and it doesn’t seem advisable
to try and make any chartges in this house, as it is absolutely
necessary that new engine house should be erected and we
sincerely hope that you will take steps to erect suitable headquarters for the department.

Second.—We again repeat our recommendation that House
No. be sold and modern engine house erected in this thickly
settled district. The school house lot would seem centrally
located and it would not be very costly thing to change from
the present quarters to there, when we consider the present
engine house could be sold for very considerable sum.

Third.—We again repeat that Iengine No. be refitted with
new pumps and engine. This engine has been in use twentyeight years. |

Fourth.—We trust that you will make appropriations to
enable us to purchase during the coming year two motordriven pieces of apparatus, so that the department may be
equipped with horseless apparatus, as quickly as possible.

Fifth—We recommend the purchase of feet of
 -inch hose.

Sixth.—We would recommend the purchase of secondhand automobile for the purpose of teaching the men how to
operate an automobile, as it is not wise to allow them to practice
on the expensive piece of apparatus which the department ,
owns, and this apparatus could also be used by the Assistant
Chief and in many wavs would prove useful in the department.
This piece of apparatus we think could be purchased at reasonable figure.

Seventh.—We recommend that at least six new men be
put on in the coming year, in addition to the ten new men
required by the acceptance of the act relating to vacations by
firemen. We have been running for quite long time shorthanded and it tis really necessary that we should have more
men to properly man the apparatus and we trust in making the
appropriations you will make it possible to carry out the foregoing recommendation.

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS

Eighth.—We recommend that the wires of the fire alarm
system be placed underground in the thickly settled portions
of the City, and we trust that this year may see this improvement made. |

HAY AND FEED.

The cost of hay and feed this year has been very much
higher than usual and the fluctuating prices of feed and hay
makes it desirable for the commissioners to lay in large stock
when the market  favorable and we are glad to say that this
year we have been very fortunate in securing hay and feed at
reasonable prices and we are fairly well supplied at the present
time.

HOUSES.

The houses generally are in very good condition, especially
the Highland and Elmwood houses, where the separate sleeping rooms have been arranged for the men and the general
conditions in these houses are excellent. The Board of Public
Works has taken excellent care of the houses the last year. Regarding the headquarters, the conditions here continue very

for new engine house.

department. We have purchased four new horses during the
year.

REPORT OF THE
To His Honor, the Mayor, and the Board of Aldermen of the

City of Holvoke.

Gentlemen:—The thirty-second annual statement of all
matters pertaining to the Board of Health for the year ending
November thirtieth, nineteen hundred twelve is hereby submitted for your consideration.

ORGANIZATION.

The members of the Board of Health met for organization
the first Monday of February, nineteen hundred twelve and
elected the following officers: Maurice Lynch, Chairman,
J. Joseph Carroll, M. D., Secretary and Bacteriologist.

Appended are the reports of the Health Officer, Inspector
of Plumbing, Inspector of Milk, Inspector of Meat and Provisions, Bacteriologist and Superintendent of the Holyoke
Sanitarium, also the mortality tables and records of the registration of contagious diseases with record of the office work
and statement of the receipts and expenditures.

Regular meetings of the Board have been held the  th of
each month and special mectings when necessary.

Many complaints of all kinds have been received and careful attention has been given to each one and steps taken to better
conditions and remove the causes.

The general health of the city is influenced by many factors
and in order to accomplish the best results the work of the Board
of Health must cover man lines and each year sees an increase
in the amount of work required of this department, not only

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH
in the prevention of contagious diseases but in many other
lines bearing upon the safeguarding of the public health.

The general health and its freedom from communicable
diseases with the sanitary protection afforded by its sewerage
system and water supply has its influence on its growth and
these features in our city make commendable showing.

The contagious disease table and the mortality records
also show an evidence of its healthfulness and by comparing
these rates for number of years the information becomes
valuable.

The work of caring for persons in quarantine has assumed
larger proportions and will continue to increase as work formerly
in charge of the Overseers of the Poor now comes under the
supervision of the Board of Health as required by the Revised
Laws, Chapter  Section  .

The Board of Health of city or town shall to the exclusion
of the Overseers of the Poor retain charge of any case arising
under the provisions of this Chapter in which it shall have
acted.

This necessitates larger appropriation for quarantine
fund which the Board strives to use in judicious manner.

TUBERCULOSIS HOSPITAL.

The ‘Vuberculosis Hospital has been in operation. since
February  th,  this being the date the first patient was
admitted and has proved conclusively the necessity and desirability of such an institution in our city.

There have been forty seven patients received at the hospital, the conditions shown and the results obtained in the cases
received proves also the need of continued work along these
lines upon broader basis.

Recent figures show there are now cases of tuberculosis in Nlassachusetts and accommodations for not more than
  patients. Ttus to the credit of the City of Holyoke that t
we are among the first who have established hospital for

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH  
tuberculosis and that our hospital has been approved by the
Trustees of Hospitals for Consumptives.

The matter of the enlargement of the hospital will have to be
considered in the near future, so great has the necessity become
to admit new patients who cannot be accommodated at the
present.

We cared for fifteen patients in state sanitariums and thirty
six persons were assisted at their homes during the vear.

SMALL POX HOSPITAL.

The readiness of this Ilospital at all times was very con
venient during this year as it was found necessary to use It
during some part of four different months of the year.

The fact that smallpox could be present in the city during
four months of the year and cause no epidemic is undoubtedly
due to the persistence with which the vaccination laws have
been enforced. [It would not be difficult to see what might and
probably would have happened if the hundreds of children
vaccinated during the last two years had been left without
that protection.

| The total cost of paticnts and persons quarantined was
$ .

There were six patients treated for small pox at Tillside
Hospital and total of persons cared for in quarantine.

The following gives the places quarantined and number of
persons quarantined therein:

  Lyman Street................. ........... persons

  High Street......... .................... persons

  Fountain Street...................... ....  persons

  High Street...... .. ................... persons

  Elm Street. ...... ... ............. persons
QUARANTINE.

A very serious problem that has confronted the Board of
Ilealth for some time is an efficient method of quarantine and
we are of the opinion that this cannot be effective until the city

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH

erects contagious disease hospital or the Health author aties

rigidly quarantine every person in the house containing ase

of contagious disease. |
MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS.

The Medical Inspection of Schools is an important xoart
of the Health work of the city. Its object is to increase the
efficiency of the schools by ascertaining the deviations xom
normal in the children, calling the attention of the parent  to
these facts to the end that they may be remedied and by exc uding from school those children who are suffering from comm Unicable diseases and by maintaining general supervision of  the
hygiene and sanitation of the school buildings.

The actual value of the work depends upon the thorovcz &- :
ness and systematic manner in which it  carried out.

VITAL STATISTICS.

During the year, eight hundred eighty-eight dea» ths
occurred in the city, giving death rate of per cent- an
thousand population. Excluding the non-residents our ac @
death rate is per thousand.

Report of the Bacteriologist
To the Board of Health:

. Gentlemen:—I herewith submit my report on cases referred
to me for laboratory examination during the fiscal year ending
November .

DIPHTHERIA.
Although have found positive cultures in total of
  referred to me as against for last year we can still feel
that we have been fortunate in having so few cases. For city
of persons we have been remarkably free from this disease during the past two years.
TUBERCULOSIS.

As has been the case every year since this laboratory was
established, this branch of the work has shown marked increase
over the preceding year. The increase this year is, in measure
due to the fact that the Board has required positive sputum
examination in the case of all patients admitted to the Sanitarium. :

TYPHOID FEVER.

As has been the case in past years, the number of blood
specimens submitted for Widal examination was small in pro- "
portion to the number of cases reported as typhoid. would
suggest that the Board adopt rule requiring an examination
in every case reported.

OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM.

I would suggest also that physicians be compelled to take

a smear for bacteriological examination in all cases where

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH
there is discharge from the eyes in infants under two weeks
of age.

Appended you will find detailed report of the examinations
made during the year.  ,

Office of Gas and Electric Department.
December .
To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen, of the
City of Holyoke, Massachussetts.

Gentlemen:—I hand you herewith the tenth annual
report of the Gas and Electric Department.

There have been no great changes or additions at the
electric light station, the usual repairs only having been made.
All necessary increases in equipment have been made to the
distributing system. .

+ The year has been one of continued growth, the records
showing that we have sent out during the past twelve months
  cubic feet of gas, an increase over last year of
  cubic feet. The electric department shows an output of kilowatts for the year, an increase of  
kilowatts over last year. :

The new gas retort house is well under way and will
undoubtedly be ready for making and distributing gas in the
early part of the summer.

I call your special attention to that part of my inaugural
address showing the indebtedness that is charged up against
this department on the original purchase and would recommend
that some steps be taken to provide for the payment annually
of specified sum until this indebtedness is wiped out.

JOSEPH J. KELLY,
JEREMIAH J. KEANE,
WILLIAM G. BEAUDRO,
Board of Assessors.

 REPORT OF THE ;
| Board of ublic Works
To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen of the

City of Holyoke, Mass. :

Gentlemen:—The report of this Department for the fiscal
year ending November is herewith submitted for
your consideration and for the consideration of the citizens of
Holyoke.

The Board hopes that all our citizens will avail themselves
of copy of this report and that it will be carefully studied.
The value of municipal documents of this nature lies wholly
in the benefit that the citizens derive from the facts therein
contained. It is our belief that the closer department comes
to the people and the people to department, the more lasting
benefits the department gives to the people and it is only by
considerate study of annual and other department reports and
papers that the public can become fully conversant with the
doings of its officials.

The maintenance of the departments under the Board cost
three hundred seventy-two thousand eight hundred thirty-five
dollars and fifty-two cents ($ the past year. There
has been balance carried to of twenty four thousand
two hundred seventy-three dollars and twenty cents ($ .
 ). The maintenance cost is not complete in that the school
janitors’ salaries and supplies and the Tuberculosis Hospital
were transferred to the School Board and the Board of Health
respectively during the early summer.

The canal bridges on Lyman street and Cabot street and
the first level canal bridge on Appleton street should be replaced
with modern structures without delay, even though the replaceREPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
ment of these bridges may necessitate the going without of other
things that Holyoke may desire, and even though it may be necessary to ask the Legislature to authorize special loan for this
work. The Board does not believe the bridges are safe for
continued use under modern traffic. For more than year the
Cabot street bridges have been closed to street cars. The
bridges in question were never intended for automobile trucks
and heavy vans. At present Lyman strect should be the
natural artery for traffic to South Hadley Falls and South Hadley
and traffic crossing the South Hadley Falls bridge while Cabot
street and Appleton Street should accommodate traffic coming
into the city from Willimansett and the south, rather than compelling heavy vehicles to use the Dwight Street bridges as they
are now forced to do. We have been very fortunate in the
matter of accidents upon any of our bridges. This fact may
have caused us to become somewhat careless in their replacement. The cost of planking alone would bear large share of
the interest cost upon the capital invested in permanent roadways on these bridges. The cost of the planking is continually
increasing and will in short time be practically prohibitive
if the present rate of increase continues. The Board believes
that the replacement of these bridges will be in the interests
of economy and safety and therefore urges immediate action.

In the coming year, or the near future, the sewer now discharging from River Terrace must be extended down the slope
and under the Boston and Maine Railroad tracks into the Connecticut River, or filter beds must be provided for the sewage.
Measures should be taken to provide relief for the Cabot street
sewer as it enters the [front street system under the Elolvoke
and Westfield railroad tracks and for the Issex street sewer
westerly from the Front street system. The conditions that have
existed on Cabot strect at the railroad are too familiar to need
recital. The construction of connecting sewer with the
sewer now in Nlain street ending at Berkshire  street,

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS

south along Main street to the Front street sewer which crosses
this street near the north line of Riverside Park, is urgent and
should be accomplished without unnecessary delay.

The City is to face serious problem in the disposal of its
ashes and other refuse material and while there is no immediate
cause for alarm, additional space for this purpose must be provided the coming year by extending the Maple street cluvert,
so-called, easterly towards the Holyoke and Westfield Railroad
tracks and by extending the culvert of the Franklin street
sewer some two hundred feet south into the main channel of
Elmwood Park, which sewer was commenced the past summer.
The extension of both of these culverts will add to the park
land and on the Franklin street culvert after the fill is made,
the playground south of Bh street can be enlarged.

The Board recommends the discontinuance of tar concrete
sidewalk work and the construction of cement walks in their
stead. This is based upon grounds of long term economy,
for while the tar concrete walk is cheaper to construct, the
cement walk is cheaper at the end of ten-year or fifteen-year
period while not prohibitive in additional expense at the start,
besides furnishing continually smooth, even and satisfactory
walk upon which hability of accident is materially decreased.

There has been another building added to the department
of buildings the past year which will necessitate some additional
expense in after year. It has been stated before by the Board
that as the buildings increase, the expense of maintenance
increases also. Generally speaking, the buildings are in good
condition. It will, however, be necessary the coming year,
or soon thereafter, to install complete new sanitaries in the Hamtlton Street School building, also the renovating of the girls’
sanitaries in the Elm Street School building and the boys’
sanitaries in the Nonotuck Street School building. Late in the
fall communication was received from the Commissioner of
Public Records by the Board of Aldermen indicating that immediate steps must be taken to better safeguard the records
of the City. This matter is now before the Aldermen and the

.

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
Finance Committee has recommended an appropriation of
five thousand one hundred hfty dollars $( for completing
this work. This work ought not to be neglected and should
be undertaken at once.

We recommend continuance of oiling streets. An examination of the records shows that the dust was more effectually
laid in Holyoke in than in preceding years owing to the use
of oil, and that the expense was not as great as some years in
the past. Additional apparatus is needed to carry on this work

in satisfactory manner The department added two oil distributors last season whicn have done excellent work. The
Board has now under test street flushing apparatus that can
be operated without excessive cost. It is hoped that this
machine will prove satisfactory. There has been great need of
apparatus of this kind for use upon paved areas and should
the apparatus meet the expectations of the Board we believe
that cleaner and more healthful business section will be developed and that the disagreeable features of street watering
with the alternate muddy and dusty thoroughfares will cease.

It is to be hoped that the condition of the alleys along the
principal streets can be improved and that the surfaces may
be kept cleaner. great proportion of the unsightly condition
of our streets  due to the manner in which the alleys are kept
and the disposal of papers and other refuse matter by the abutting tenants. The nearness of unclean alleys to the principal
thoroughfares of Holyoke and the attendant effects upon the
streets is forcibly illustrated upon windy days, also during
wet weather. There has not as yet been found satisfactory
manner for the keeping and disposal of waste material in the
business section. The manner in which the waste paper is kept
and allowed to be distributed in the residential sections could
well be given attention and some method of improvement
devised. This department is caver to co-operate with merchants
and residents in any sane and reasonable method that will bring :
about better and more healthful and pleasing condition of
our city. The Board has before urged co-operation, it now seeks

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
and asks for the co-operation and assistance of every person
who likes or loves the city in which they dwell, to aid in establishing condition of civic purity of which we shall all be proud.
It is to be hoped, also, that better condition of garbage
collection and disposal can be had the coming year and it Is
also to be desired that all householders will aid the department
in bringing about these conditions by the separation of house
offal from other refuse material of the premises. The rules of
the Board of Health provide that house offal shall be kept in
closed, water-tight, receptacles and that it shall be free from
all foreign substances. little thoughtfulness on the part of
the houscholder is all that would be required to work magnificient improvement in this department. If the householders
wi!l co-operate with the Board in keeping the house offal distinct from other refuse, the Board promises to use its utmost
endeavors to see that this obnoxious matter is promptly and
efficiently removed from the premises and it must remind
householders and tenants that the only means we have of knowing that garbage is not removed is by notice from them and
upon receiving such notice the Board will affect speedy remedy
for the evasions or oversights of its contractors or employees.
There was little or no work started this year that was not
entirely completed. With the exception of the construction of the sidewalks, the Railroad street improvements have been entirely finished. Much work has’ been
done in the repairing and reconstruction of permanent highway
work which was constructed from eight to twelve years ago.
A new brick pavement has been laid on Sargeant street between Mfain street and Race street and new concrete and
bitulithic roadway was laid on Jackson street between Main
street and Bridge street. Nfuch work was done in the repairing
of the Springfield road and Northampton street. The asphalt
block pavement on Dwight street between High street and
Maple street and on Hampden street between High and Maple
streets has been resurfaced with tar concrete mixture. The
same mixture was applied to High street between Hampden

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
and Dwight streets. The construction of new gutters and crosswalks has been continued. [xtensive work, costing nearly
four thousand dollars ($ ), has been done in maintaining
the country roads.

The planking on the various canal bridges and the South
Hadley Falls bridge was renewed. This directs attention to
the necessity of some permanent form of roadway on all the
bridges. The laying of wooden block pavements upon the South
Hadley Falls bridge and the Willimansett bridge could wisely
be considered. During the past fall the Holyoke street Railway Company has relayed its track on Cabot street between
Main street and the Willimansett bridge, and some thought
could well be directed toward bettering the condition of the
roadway in this location.

| The expense of strect cleaning has continued to increase
and until some more efficient and effective form of street cleaning apparatus has beef devised, this cost will continue to grow.
The cost of cleaning gravelled streets was two thousand four
hundred twenty dollars and eighty-five cents ($ :) paved
Streets, ten thousand five hundred seventy-six dollars and
twenty-four cents ($ ), and macadam streets, three
thousand eight hundred fifty dollars and thirty-nine cents
( ). This expense should be considered with the recommendation made by the Board in the matter of street flushing
apparatus. Additional teams have been provided for the highWay and alley departments and the cost of maintenance necessarily shows an increase over  large amount of work
was done by the highway department on the state highway
leading to Mt. Tom, for which the City was reimbursed by the
State. |
The total cost of maintenance and new work in all of our
buildings the past year was onc hundred forty-seven thousand
eight hundred two dollars and sixty-one cents ($ ),
which has been itemized in full in the tables hereto annexed.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS

The Joseph Metcalf School building has .been completed
with an expenditure during  including the furnishings, of
forty-four thousand seven hundred ten dollars and ninety-eight
cents ($ .)

The Tuberculosis Hospital was opened for patients early
in the year and was transferred to the Board of Health on March
  .

The school janitors’ salaries and school janitors’ supplies
departments have been transferred from the Board to the School
Committee, the transfer dating from Mav .

. The additions to the City Farm buildings and property
have been practically completed, the expense being twenty-five
thousand eight hundred twenty-four dollars ($ ). There
is at the present time modern, well equipped plant, both
steam and electric, at the institution.

Plans for the Contagious Disease Hospital have been completed and are ready, at such time as the Citv may be able to
make an appropriation for this building. There are, however, —
available buildings now on the Shea [’arm, so-called, which, at
a comparatively small figure, can be remodelled into an Isolation Hospital, suitable for the needs of the City for some years
to come.

The additions to the Elmwood Engine House puts this
building among the modern structures of the city. considerable amount of work was necessary to provide individual sleeping rooms for the men, feature that is to be generally desired
in all of the Fire Department houses.

If there is to be steady continued increase in the cost of
fucl as the Board has experienced in the past years, an additional
appropriation in this department must be made in years to come
over and above that which would ordinarily be needed to care
for new buildings.

A general demand, which is increasing, has been made upon
the Forestry Department for trees this year. The planting of
new trees and care of the existing trees has been done at an

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
expense of one thousand five hundred twenty dollars ($ ).
It is with regret that the Board records the death of William
A. Chase, Forester, which occurred February |

A large number of new sewers to mect the demands of new
houses, have been constructed the past year, the total expenditures in the Permanent Sewer Department being six thousand
nine hundred ninety-seven dollars and fifty seven cents ($ and for additional maintenance and construction of
sewers fourteen thousand six hundred ninety-eight dollars and
sixty cents ($ ).

Considerable ayitation has been had that large numbers of
automobiles pass through the outskirts of Holyoke without
the city receiving any attention from them or having any direct
or indirect benefit from the traffic, neither does the city receive
from such trafic return upon the investment of constructing
and maintaining the highways in this location. This trafhe
is mainly through trafic up and down the Connecticut Valley.
By campaign of education and co-operation on the part of
city and automobile clubs it may be possible that some way
might be devised whereby Holyoke would receive its proper
share of benefit that naturally ought to come to it from the
vast amount of this trafic through its borders. Many plans
have been suggested, some of them very expensive if carried
out. There is without question solution of the problem and
without making any definite recommendations the Board is 
content to lay the matter before the people, believing that a
practical solution can be had if proper attention and consideration  given the subject.

A complete and detailed statement covering all the work
done in the various departments is annexed hereto. We therefore submit the same for your earnest consideration.

The Maintenance of the Water, Gas and Electric |
departments are not included in the foregoing diagram becaus€ |
those departments maintain themselves without any cost tO
the taxpayers. a
As matter of fact the Water department pays annually
about  year net to the city in taxes, while the Gas
department by its low rates for lighting and power and the
maintenance of certain lights at its own expense contributés
its share towards lessening the taxpayers’ burden.
Respectfully,
D. W. Kenney,
City Auditor,
. City of Holyoke:

REPORT OF THE
CITY AUDITOR
To the Honorable, the Mayor, and Board of Aldermen.

Gentlemen:—I present herewith the annual statement of
the receipts and expenditures for the fiscal year  in the
form and manner required by the State of Massachussetts. :

I have audited the accounts of the Water department,
Gas and [lectric department, found them corrcet, the receipts
properly recorded and promptly deposited and the expenditures
approved in due form. The Tax Collector's books and entries
have been audited so far as possible. The postings here reach
the thousands and as each  separately checked it takes quite
a while to complete his accounts. The report also contains ,
detailed report of the expenditures in the Contingent Account,
City Indebtedness, Sinking Funds and Vax Collector's exhibit,
the bonds issued during the year with the purpose for which
they were issued, the cash on hand and the borrowing capacity.

There was  borrowed during the year for the
following purposes: White Reservoir,  Gas and [Hlectric
Plant, Sewers Construction,  Highways Construction, Sidewalks Construction, Schools,
$ .

Payments of the City debt and additions to the sinking
funds during the year were as follows: City debt, serial bonds,
$ Gas and Itlectric Plant bonds, Elolvoke and |
Westfield R. R. bonds, Water Dept. bonds, ;
Payments to City debt sinking fund  and earnings,

  REPORT OF CITY AUDITOR
$ Water Dept. sinking fund earnings, ;
grand total, Total bonds issued excess
of payments over loans, The-net debt is ;
a decrease in the net debt of The borrowing capacity
is an increase over the year of .

There was given additional appropriations to various
departments  out of revenue receipts or surplus and this
within the  tax rate. .

Respectfully submitted,

REPORT OF THE
Board of Park Commissioners
To the Honorable the Mayor and Board of Aldermen, of the City
of Holyoke:

Gentlemen:—The Board of Park Commissioners beg to
present herewith the following annual report of the work of
the Park Department for the past season together with detailed
statement of the Receipts and Expenditures and recommendations for the coming year.

The parks were opened for the season on Monday April  ,

 and remained open continuously until November  The
work has been carried on very successfully and has been source
of satisfaction to the Board and the people of the city, who have
commended the appearance of the different parks for the past
year. The Board hopes to continue the good work next season
and asks your careful consideration of its recommendations.

We give herewith an account of the work on the several
parks with suggestions for the coming year.
| HAANIPDEN PARK.

This is the oldest of the parks of the city and is very popular
by reason of its central location. The park was in poor condition in the spring owing to the improvements of the previous
fall. Several of the grass plots had to be recovered and seeded
and the banks bordering on the cross walks had to be graded
and returfed, owing to the damage from the installing of the
gutters on the cross-walks. The tree belts on Dwight and
Chestnut streets were turfed and adds great deal to the
general appearance of the park; the board hopes to turf the
belts on Hampden and Alaple streets another year. The shrubs
were cut back and the usual maintenance work carried along.

D  REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS
PROSPECT PARK.

The park has been in bad condition for the past few years
but ts beginning to show improvement and we hope another
vear will bring it back to its proper condition. great need of
the park ts better walks and the Board would recommend the
construction of concrete walk along the Paraphet Wall; it
would also add greatly to the appearance of the wall and the
park, if proper lights were placed on the wall and the unsightly
poles removed from the banks. children’s playground  s
connected with the park and should be fenced in and  better

. equipped. ‘The Board would also like to install one or two
drinking fountains for the accommodation of the patrons of the
park. ‘The usual maintenance work has been kept up in the
park.

KLAIWOOD PARK.

The park has been well cared for the past vear, the flowers
and shrubs having received considerable amount of attention.
The Board has made much needed and artistic improvement
in the construction of set of concrete steps at the corner of
Maple and Jackson streets, making an attractive entrance to
the park at this point. The fountain house had to be re-built
and the Board intends to place better drinking fountain here
next season. ‘The walks in the park must be recovered next
year as they are ina dangerous condition at the present tine and
more lights should be placed in the park to preserve better
order at mht. skating rink is conducted on Bh street each vear and ts much appreciated by the people of the city.
Vhe shelter and tool house at the rink was destroyed bv fire
early in the vear but it is intended to replace the same at an
early date. Vhe Board would dike to see the improvement
work on this Park continued next season by the taking of steps
for the construction of Bridge from Pine street to the Elmwood
side and also the laving out and improvement of the ball field
on Bh street. sanitary is also needed in the park.

REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS 
RIVERSIDE PARK.

The Board has given this park great amount of attention
during the year. ‘The grading has been carried along to considerable extent and the large area of shrubs thoroughly pruned
and treated. new three inch chestnut curbing was placed
around the wading pool and new sanitary drinking fountain
installed. The grass and walks have been kept in good condition and the regular maintenance work performed in satisfactory manner. The children’s wading pool still continues
to be enjoyed by the children of the locality and the Board
would recommend better shelter facilities in connection with
the pool and also lady attendant. skating rink is also
conducted on the wading pool in the winter months. We
would recommend the completion of the grading on the park
and the laying out of boys’ baseball diamond, also the addition
of more settces. :

GERMANIA AND HAMILTON PARKS.

These small parks being in the heart of thickly populated
district are used to great extent and have been well kept the
past year. It would add much to the appearance of Germania
Park if cement or granite curbing were placed around the
same and the tree belts cobbled, the tree belts at Hamilton
Park might be treated in the same manner and would tend to
keep them in satisfactory condition.

CANONCHIIVE PARR.

Nothing but the usual maintenance work has been done
on this park. It has been kept in good condition. Cinder walks
were laid on the north, south and east side of the park.

JONES PARK.

Jones Park is the largest of the Parks of the city and will
eventually become popular outing place because of its fine
location and the beautiful view to be had here. ‘The Board has
plans for the development of this park and would recommend

  REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS
a start be made. The brush was raked up in the spring and
about thirty permanent scttees built.

: LAUREL PARK.

The Board has received many compliments for the
appearance of this small park which has been of no benefit up
to this time. By the laying out of the park an attractive
addition has been made to the parks and the locality. pretty
cobble fountain was built in the center and two curved cement

 walks laid out to the both sides of the park. The grass-plots
were graded and shrubs and flowers will be added another year.
FAIRFIELD AVENUE PARKWAY.

This was added to the park area last year but little work
was doneonthesame. This yeara man has been kept at work all
season. The lawn was given therough cleaning in the spring
and several flower beds installed; the shrubs which were in bad
condition were trimmed in the fall. The Board would like to
have cement curbing placed around the grass plots.

SMALLIER TRIANGLES.

Ranger and Sullivan Squires have been kept in condition
the past year and the Corser Triangle graded by the Board of
Public Works. The Coughlin Triangle is in poor condition but
will be looked after next spring. fence must be placed
around this last named plot as it will not remain in good condition otherwise.

IN CONCLUSION. |

The Board would again call your attention to their recommendations, especially the following:— 

Walks and lights for IImwook Park.

Walks and lights for Prospect Park.

Shelter and Grading for Riverside Park.

Development of Jones Park.

In order to continue the present maintenance of the parks
and prod with the improvement work the Board would

REPORT OF THE
P layground Commissioners
To the Honorable the Mayor and Board of Aldermen:

The Playground Commission has closed very successful
year, demonstrating the fact that much can be accomplished
with small appropriation. Work has been conducted. on five
Playgrounds, Hampden, Maple, West Street, Main Street and
the William Whiting School, called the Chestnut Street ground.
In addition to these the Park Board has conducted Playground at River Side Park and on Bh Street, so that the city

has really had seven large, commodious playgrounds.

In connection with three of these playgrounds, wading
pools have been established, including wading pool at River
Side Park which have been, in the summer, very decided
benefit, and have helped in keeping smaller children from the
river and canals.

Playgrounds have been used for some purpose or other
during the greater portion of the year. In the winter the grounds
have been flooded and used as skating ponds. Last winter the
Playground Commission had six of these skating ponds located
in the following places: Highland Park, Highland School,
Hampden Street Playground, Maple Street, West Street, Main
Street, and the Park Commission had two skating ponds, one
on Bh Street and one at River Side Park. These skating
ponds or rinks have not only afforded genuine pleasure to a
very large number of children and young people but have
insured absolute safety.

The Playgrounds have been used during the year for Base
Ball and Foot Ball including both the American and Association
Games. ‘The use of the grounds for such games should be in
every way encouraged, and if such usc interferes with the younger

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS |
, [
* children then small playgrounds should be secured for the |
benefit of such children.
The summer work was placed under the control of Mr. P.  
H. Kelly and he has proved most efficient supervisor. The
report which he has made to the Commission contains so many
features of genuine interest that it has been decided to include
it in the report of the Commission and is given as follows:
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE \
Supervisor of Holyoke Playgrounds.
To the Honorable Board of Playground Commissioners of the ‘
City of Holyoke, Massachusetts:—
I have the honor to submit to you my first report as Supervisor of the Holyoke Playgrounds, for the season of  .
PROGRESS.
The playground season of has shown marked advancement in several important respects, chiefly among them
the matter of organization, and in the systematizing of our
play programs.
With corps of twenty-five playground workers, and with
well qualified directors and assistants at each playground, the
Success of the work was assured from the start. It is my opinion that under the guidance of the directors, the teachers have
made steady advancement in learning the essentials of our play
problems, and are capable staff of playground workers.
PHYSICAL EDUCATION TOR GIRLS.
The earnest and enthusiastic efforts of the directors and
their assistants, with the girls in the department of physical
education, showed marked advancement in interesting the older
girls in play and recreation. This was forcibly brought to my

  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS

attention by the interest shown in modified game of baseball,

called playground ball; also by the intense interest taken in

the interplayground meets. Folk dancing was more popular

this season, as more attention was given this department by

the supervisor, and number of new folk dances were introduced.
RAFFIA AND BASKETRY.

A more instructive occupation cannot be found for children than basketry. It is not only fascinating in itself, but
develops patience, judgment, dexterity and skill, and embodies
the satisfaction of making beautiful and useful article. It
teaches concentration and arouses the inventive faculties in
the child.

The articles made were of practical value to the child and
for the decoration of the home.

Some of the articles made were:— |

Picture frames in colors, Baby bonnets,

Whisk-broom holders, Opera bags,

Raffia Mats, Card receivers (two colors), |

Sewing dolls hats, Twine bag-holders,

Covered coat hangers, Candy baskets (reed rafha),

Sewing baskets (reed raffia), Work baskets in two colors

Hats (all designs). :

SEWING. DOLL CRAFT

This occupation mects the every day needs of the children,
more than any other, in providing an opportunity for the girl
to acquire knowledge of materials, and manual dexterity in
processes which will be of inestimable value to her in her girlhood as well as in her adult life. The work consists of the
complete dressing of same, including all the necessary apparel.

STORY TELLING.
 The story telling department is one which is least restricted.
Having practically the whole world to draw from its material,

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
and the possibilities in story telling for guiding the child’s mind
to the best of everything in the world, are limitless. The
directors and assistants are to be commended for the care and
intelligence manifested in telling their stories. We are greatly
indebted to Mrs. James A. Allen for her hearty co-operation
and assistance. Her story hours given the workers and the
list of splendid stories suggested by her were of great value.

. PHYSICAL EDUCATION FOR BOYS.

The program of this department was under the charge of
the directors, with one male assistant on each ground, except
On the Chestnut Street grounds, where at the commencement
of the season we had large attendance of boys. But with no
male assistant to guide or look after the boys’ interests, the
attendance soon decreased. The work among the boys was
not what would like it to have been, but with everything
Considered, great results were achieved. number of new
activities for boys were introduced during the past season,
and great interest was manifested in the inter-playground
tournaments held about the middle of the season. The greatest
interest was shown in our great Amcrican game of baseball.
Each ground had team represent them in the league. A
Schedule of sixty games was played, Chestnut street winning
the pennant in very close race.

| SLOYD WORK.

This department was under the direction of Miss Helen C.
Moriarty, who visited each ground one day week. This class
of work was very much enjoyed by the boys. About the middle
of the season we doubled the number in the classes on each
ground.

The list of articles made were: 

Paper knives, spindles, tops, pen and pencil holders, spool

racks, spindle and key boards, pin cushions, match strikers,

  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS
post card holders, pictures frames, bird houses, broom brush
holders, dolls’ beds and furniture.

REED BASKETRY.

Reed basketry was introduced the latter part of the season
with the boys. This class of occupation they enjoyed, and a
number of very pretty and useful baskets were made. would
recommend that provisions be made next season to do more of
this work.

ATTENDANCE. )

two and four p. m., the total number being divided by two to
find the attendance for each day.

credit for the manner in which they administered their duties.

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
NEW ACTIVITIES INTRODUCED.

Playground. ball was introduced at the commencement of
the season, and proved to be very popular, especially among
the smaller boys and larger girls. This game is much like
regular baseball. It is played with large ball and small
bat, and the bases are forty feet apart. The game became so
popular that junior league was formed and regular schedule
of games played on the different grounds, the Hampden street
boys winning the pennant.

SPECIAL EVENTS.

The special events which occured during the past season
are all worthy of record. During the week July  th to August
 nd, series of inter-playground tournaments were held, each
ground having two meets, one on the home grounds and one
away. The interest displayed, not only by the children but
by the parents, especially the mothers, showed that they feel
the playgrounds are of vital importance in the lives of their

, growing children. The attendance of adults at these games was
large, and much enthusiasm was shown.

The events for boys were and yard dashes, relay
races, three-legged races and leap frog races. For the girls  
yard dashes, relay races, chariot races, basket ball throw and
playground ball game. The winners were given blue badges
for first, red for second and white for third prizes.

CLOSING EXERCISES.

The closing exercises held on the Maple street grounds,
on August twenty-third, were fitting finale to our season of
summer activities and were witnessed by over two thousand
people. The display of the articles made by the children on
the different grounds was on exhibition under large tent at
the north end of the grounds. The games and dances shown the
visitors were some of our every day program on our five playgrounds. To the children the event meant everything in the way

  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS 

. of eager, enthusiastic expectation, joyous and willing participation, and pleasant and lasting memories. It also gave to
them sense of what large undertaking they were part ol.
It was big lesson in co-operation and opened their eyes to what
the City is doing in big way, through the playground commission, to make them happy and give them good time. To
the spectators the games were great object lesson, and many
realized as never before the importance of the child in the life
of the community.

RECOMMENDATIONS.

I would recommend that the Commission add youfig men
in training to the staff of workers, and that one or more be engayed for each ground to assist the man in charge of the boys.

CHAIR CANING.

There should be more ample provisions made for chair
caning by the boys. This is form of creative play which brings
the home very close to the playground, and has the decided
approval of the parents.

REED BASKETRY.

This instructive occupation should also be extended and
provisions made whereby larger number of boys may be
enrolled in the classes.

SEWING.

Sewing should be extended and provisions made for the
making of larger articles, such as dust caps, aprons, utility
bags, etc.

To the Playground Commission am greatly indebted for
their hearty co-operation and assistance, and wish at this time
to acknowledge my sincere appreciation of the help received.

To the Superintendent of Public Playgrounds am also
grateful for his ever ready and willing response to assist.

The Press—The Transcript and The Telegram, were most
generous in giving space and news of our City’s playgrounds.

Respectfully Submitted,
P. H. KELLY,
Supervision Municipal Playgrounds Season  .

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
RECOMMENDATIONS.

The Commission believes that the playground work is one
of the most important undertakings in which the City of Holyoke
is engaged and that the City should give the Commission as
‘large an appropriation as  possible.

The Commission desires to make certain definite recommendations.

Ist. The most important thing to be done in connection
with the playground movement at the present time is the
employment of supervisor during the entire year. The work
which Mr. Kelly did last summer shows what can be accomplished if such work could only be continuous.

 nd. playground should be purchased in Ward two
while there is land to be obtained. The time willsooncome when playground can not be bought in that locality except at
an almost prohibitive cost. |

.  rd. The playground should be well lighted for the protection of property owners and the citizens in general.

 th. The Maple Street grounds should never be used for
any other purpose than playground. It is the central meeting
place of the city and its use as center of sport and athletic
exercises should be encouraged. To place building upon
this land would be crime to the young people of Holyoke.

 th. As fast as the City can afford it the playgrounds
should be fenced.

 th. Shelters and sanitarics should be erected on all the
grounds owned by the City.

In closing the Commission again extends its thanks to
City Officials and to the Press and especially to the Knights
of Columbus and the Elks, for their generosity in the donation
of small prizes, and to the Atherton Millinery Company for the
ribbons and flowers so generously given by it.
