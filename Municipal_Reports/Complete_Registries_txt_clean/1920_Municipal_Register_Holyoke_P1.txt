MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
To THE HonorasLe Boarp oF ALDERMEN:

We are at the threshold of new municipal year. You
with certain duties, with certain duties; both, however,
working toward common goal, namely, honest and efficient
government. That goal will) not be reached if we consider
self above the many. Disinterestedness must govern every
act. The present and future welfare of our people must. be
our guide. Our problems are many; they are varied; but not
of the kind that cannot be solved by us, if we are of the true
type of American public servant.

FINANCES

Bonds amounting to  were issued during this
year for the following purposes: Highway Construction,
$ Sewer Construction, .

Payment of the debt totalled  as follows:
City Debt, Gas and Electric Debt,  Holyoke
and Westfield Railroad Debt, Water Debt, ,
and  paid to the Sinking Fund, Water Debt. Sinking
Fund accumulations, Excess of payments over
loans, .

The total net debt from all sources is  as
against  last year; decrease of This
does not include the outstanding temporary loans in anticipation of taxes, which this year was  against 
last year.

  MAYOR'S ADDRESS

The borrowing capacity is  as against ,
an increase of .

I would like to eall the attention of the Board to the extraordinary growth of the city’s ordinary expenditures in the
past ten years. In these ten years Holvoke’s population
growth has been less than per cent. In the city’s expenditures, exclusive of the Gas and Electrie and Water Departments, were Last year the amount was also exclusive of those two departments. The inerease
amounts to more than per cent. Such tremendous
rrowth in expenditures might. be warranted if the eity had
shown corresponding growth in population and taxable
wealth. It is evident that the expenditures for ordinary
operation of the city are mounting too rapidly.

Nor can we, during the coming year, look for the unexpected increase in revenue from the State, which helped us
materially last year. It will be well for us to have these faets
in mind always, as we consider the demands for departmental
expenditures.

Your attention is urgently called to the need of much
permanent building for the city in the near future. From
the report of experts working under the direction of the
Board of Public Works it appears that there is grave danger
to hfe and property involved in the present condition of
many of the city’s bridges. At least five of the canal bridges
should be replaced with structures suited to the needs of
present and future traffic conditions within the present year.
We are further advised that these five bridges, built on the
same general plan, could be constructed for the cost of four
bridges, built at different times. The need is for bridges that
will be useful and enduring rather than ornamental. The
subject of ornamentation in bridges is one for which we have

. strong distaste, in view of recent experiences in bridge affairs. My opinion is that relief should again be sought from
the Legislature from the most unjust tax levied on us for the
Springfield Bridge.

, MAYOR’S ADDRESS  

Provision has been made for adequate repairs and paving of the county bridge. An investigation of the Willimansett bridge has recently been made and it is probable that a
recommendation will be made in the near future. In any
event, bridge building should have the right of way in the
permanent construction program of the year. 

Of other projects calling for the expenditure of large or
smaller amounts there seems no end. One which seems

| desirable to take up as soon as conditions permit, is the widening of Maple Street, from Dwight Street to Essex Street, by
the removal of the tree belt. The development of the street
. as business district within recent years and its use for auto
traffic and parking makes the project desirable one.
| The city is wasting money each year by its failure to
| provide quarters for the automobiles required for carrying on
the business of its various departments. municipal garage
could be made wise investment. Space should also be pro, vided for the machinery used by the city for building and
| repairing its highways, and for the storing of supplies in
such building.

A new barn must be built at the City Farm as soon as
possible. There, too, the machinery and carts are at all times
exposed to the elements, because of no place for their storage.

The city has expended large sum of money on bath
house in Ward One which is now unfit for use. reeommend
an appropriation to make this bath house useful.

, The school house building problem is only bit less
pressing. Both the School Department and the Board of
Public Works urge strongly the construction of large
school building on the tract of land near the Publie Library.

| They state that the schools in the vicinity are both inadequate
for the number of pupils, and not suited for modern school
needs.

The Trustees of the Vocational School also have in mind
a new building for the vocational work. At the same time
there is an increasing dissatisfaction with the results ob|
t
  MAYOR’S ADDRESS
tained from our great investment in school buildings and
school maintenance. .
It is my personal opinion that any sehool building program which leaves an opening for more experimenting with
edueational fads and fancies, and lessens the time and effort |
devoted to the educational principles on whieh the greatness |
of this community, this state and this country rests, ought to !
be curbed rather than encouraged. :
First steps have been taken for the construction of a
school at Smiths Ferry suited to the present and probable
future needs of the district. hope that in the not too dis- |
tant future some provision may be made for the West Hol- |
yoke district, from which the city secures much of its farm |
produce, and anything the city as whole might do for the |
welfare of the district would only be its Just due. The present school strueture is, speaking plainly, disgrace to the city.
CONCLUSION
The past year has been one of harmony. The Officials
and Boards have been most helpful, and wish to publicly
thank them for their assistanee and co-operation. sineerely
hope for the same measure of co-operation for the coming
year, and am confident that if it is given, our city affairs !
will be well eonducted.

REPORT OF THE
e
Gas and Electric Department.
City of Holyoke, Massachusetts.
Office of Gas and Electric Department,
January .
To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen:
GENTLEMEN: have the honor to submit herewith the
report of the Gas and Electric Department for the year ending November it being the eighteenth annual report
of the Department. :
The amount of gas sent out im was eubie
feet, an increase of seven per cent  over the send-out of
 .
The amount of electricity sent out in was kilowatts, an increase of twenty per cent  over the
send-out of  .

In the history of the Department the year will undoubtedly always stand out as year when the costs of manufacture reached unheard of and undreamed of heights. In
the Gas Department the increased eost of the three principal
items, Coal, Oil and Wages was  over  an increase of fifty-three per cent ). The inerease in the
total expense was an increase of forty-four per
eent ). In the Electric Department the increased cost
of Coal and Wages was  over  an increase of
sixty-two per cent  ). The increase in the total expense
was an increase of forty-two per cent ).

The comparative tables on pages and show the inerease in expenses since  .
 

  REPORT OF GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT

In spite of the increased cost of generating electricity
we were able to maintain our low lighting rate of six cents
per kilowatt. The rates to users of power were re-arranged
to eliminate some inequalities in the old rates. This change
made slight increase in our larger consumers, and we now
have rate under which the average cost per kilowatt deereases In straight line proportionately with the amount
consumed.

The price of gas was raised August Ist, from  to
$  net per thousand eubie feet, with minimum eharege of
fifty cents per month, but as the average cost for the whole
year was about  and the inereased rate was in effect for
only four months of the vear, the Gas Department shows a
net deficit for the year.

| On July Ist the Department proposed to establish a
service charge of fifty cents per month per meter, but the
objection to this charge was so great that it was decided to
change the rate per thousand ecubie feet instead. It is unfortunate that the consumers in general are unable to anticipate the benefits to be derived from charge of this
nature, which would distribute the cost of serviee equitably
among all consumers. The Department would then be able
(because each consumer had paid his share of the cost to
serve) to sell the gas itself at much lower rate. 

THE ELECTRIC STATION.

We had hoped at the beginning of the year that some
definite decision could be reached regarding the construction
of new station. On recommendation of the joint committee
of the Board of Aldermen and Chamber of Commerce, the
Legislature was petitioned for an increase in the borrowing
eapacity of the Department, definite decision being postponed
until this petition was granted. This petition was referred
to the next General Court, which delayed action for at least
another year. As the need for increased capacity was imREPORT OF GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT  
parative, it was decided to install two new H. P. boilers
with the necessary stokers, super-heaters, ete., aS soon as
possible. The boilers are now in place and such of the other
appliances‘as are not in place are shipped and will be erected
as soon as they arrive.

With this additional boiler capacity we will have reached
the absolute limit of our present station. If our largest unit
should be shut down, our generating capacity would be  
K. W. and we have had during the past year load of  
K. W. at one time. It is plain, therefore, that should anything
happen to our generating plant we would be unable to supply
the demand for power.

During the year, new electric meters were Installed.
This is the largest inerease in any one year in the history of
the Department, and is an increase of per cent in the total
number of meters installed.

This large inerease in the number of meters has made
necessary many changes in the lines and transformers necessary to carry the inereased load, new transformers having
been added during the year. New feeders for hght and power
must be provided during the eoming year, and some of the
material has been purehased and  on hand.

THE GAS WORKS.

During the year materials were purchased and the work
of re-modelling our two water gas machines was started.
These machines at present have capacity of ecubie
feet per hours. The changes under way are planned to
increase the capacity to eubiec feet per hours, and
renovate the machines throughout. new blower, electric
driven, larger air blast pipe, new valves and fittings, air and
steam meters, etc., are being installed. When these changes
are completed the machines will be more easily operated, the
raw materials accurately measured, the fires cleaned more
readily and the machines brought thoroughly up to date.

  REPORT OF GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT

A new turbine driven fan has been installed on the main
line to the storage holder on Canal Street. This holder contains our chief reserve supply of gas and maintains the
pressure on the mains throughout the City.

The new fan will send the gas as it  made to this holder,
and is capable of passing cubie feet per hours
avainst the pressure of the holder. duplicate of this
machine should be installed to provide for emergencies.

The distribution system was increased by the addition of
  feet of inch mains, feet of inch, feet of inch,
  feet of inch, and feet of inch. In addition to
these extensions to the mains new house services were laid.

The total number of meters installed is only more
than last year. This small increase is due to the fact that a
number of meters which were installed for emergeney or aceommodation, and from which the Department received no
revenue have been removed since the minimum charge of fifty
eents per meter was established.

Bonds amounting to  have been retired during
the year.

Respectfully submitted, .
JOHN J. KIRKPATRICK, Manager.

health work. No attempt should be made to compute in dollars and cents the value of human life.

Many complamts of all kinds have been received and
careful attention has been given to each one and steps taken
to improve eonditions and remove the cause.

The general health of the city is influenced by many
factors and In order to accomplish the best results the work
of the Board of Health must cover many. lines and each year
sees an Increase In the amount of work required of this department, not only mn the prevention of contagious diseases
but in many. other lines bearing upon the safeguarding of the
public health.

REPORT OF THE
Sani it
anitary Inspector.
"  THE BoarD oF HEALTH:
Gentlemen: As Sanitary Inspector submit report of
the work done during the fiseal year ending November .
INSPECTING AND ABATING NUISANCES.
Forty-six official notices have been sent to owners of build- ngs where nuisances were found and twice that number were
personally requested to abate minor nuisanees. All was accomplished without resorting to court procedure.

During the year number of complaints were received
at this office and same were inspected.

Five hundred twenty complaints were received at this
office, three hundred forty-nine of which were for uncollected
garbage, other causes of complaints were for dirty yards,
cellars, leaking roofs, dirty toilets, dirty tenements, keeping
pigs, rabbits, hens and coal gas odors. All these complaints
were inspected and cared for and reports to this office of results were made by me.

‘ INSPECTION OF TENEMENTS.

During the year number of tenements were inspected
to find out under what conditions the people were living. I
find that owing to the scarcity of tenements that everything
with walls and roof on is occupied including dark bed rooms
where no ray of sunshine ever reaches and by far too many
families are occupying such tenements. yearly inspection
of tenement conditions should be inspected. During this
year made such inspections,

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH  
INSPECTION OF ALLEYS AND YARDS.

The efforts to improve the conditions in the alleys has
been continued during the year and most of them have been
cleared of ash boxes and other obstructions. The alley between Main and Race Streets from Appleton to Spring
Streets has been paved at the expense of the property owners :
and this is much needed improvement. number of other
alleys in the business section would also be improved by
paving. :

INSPECTION OF GARBAGE RECEPTACLES AND
COLLECTIONS. ,

I have paid special attention to this important work and
have installed during the year new garbage cans to replace leaking and broken ones and would recommend that
the rules of both the Board of Health and Board of Public
Works which forbid the mixing of garbage with ashes or other
refuse to be strictly enforced. By so doing thousands of |
tenants will be protected from dangerous nuisance, not only
in the tenement blocks where they are living but also the
thousands who live in the blocks in the vicinity of our public
dumps.

CO-OPERATION NEEDED TO BE EFFECTIVE.

Again positively state, that if the City Ordinances
were more rigidly enforced our streets and alleys would look
at all times much better and no hardships need be imposed,
but honest co-operation of the Police Department with the
efforts of the Board is required.

In conclusion desire to thank all the members of the
Department for their courtesy and co-operation.

Respectfully submitted, .
DANIEL D. MAHONEY,
Sanitary Inspector.

during the period, the amounts due the Department with the

Balance, net income for year .. 

The receipts for water rents were  more than
those of the previous year. The greater part of this increase
came from the record breaking consumption of water for

* manufacturing purposes, most of the mills having run at full

REPORT OF WATER BOARD  
eapacity until the elosing month of the year. From the
present business depression, and the indications that it will :
continue at least until spring, it can be’ forecasted that the
receipts for water rents during the coming year will be considerably less than they were for  .

On account of the high price of materials and searcity
of labor, little new work was done except extensions of the
pipe system where necessary to provide water service for
new houses constructed. An itemized account of work done
and general information concerning rainfall, height of reservoirs, ete., is given in the Superintendent's report which is
hereto annexed and to which you are respectfully referred.
The largest item of expenditure for was the payment of
$  for taxes: this item amounts to twenty per cent
of the total receipts for water rents and is about sixty per
cent of what remained of the total vearly income after maintenance and fixed charges, other than taxes, were met. If
the wise policy is to be maintained of paying for ordinary
extensions from the yearly receipts, rather than by bond
Issues, the income of this department will soon either have
to be increased, or reduction made in the sum which the
water takers annually turn over to general taxation.

Since  the year when the first payment of taxes
was made, this tax levy has inereased from  to
$ while the payment by the city for water used and
for hydrant rentals has decreased from  in to
$  in  In other words while the Water Department has installed new hydrants and made extensions
and replacement in the distribution system costing about
$ wholly for increased water supply efficieney for
fire protection, the taxes have increased while the
receipts from the city for water rents and hydrant charges
have decreased From this it will be seen that some
of the burdens of increased costs of the general government
is being shifted on to the Water Department, whose increased

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD ;
income has not corresponded with the increased amount that |
has to be raised by general taxation.
The total sum received by the Department for furnishing
water for fire protection, both public and private, at present
. amounts to only  annually, which barely meets ‘the cost
of hydrant maintenance. If the annual hydrant rental were
increased from  to the Water Department would receive
an amount approximately what it costs to furnish fire protection, and, at the present rate of taxation the general
treasury would annually net about as much as was originally
provided.
In the matter of the private fire protection for buildings
having automatic fire sprinkler svstems the’ Board is making ,
investigations with the view of establishing regulations for .
their installation and maintenanee, and also, how much, if
any, charge should be made for the service the department
now renders free.
A conference was held during the year with the Board
of Public Works in reference to their request that the Water
Department pay substantial part of the cost of concrete
or other suitable surface for that portion of the highway  
leading to Westfield which is adjacent to the Ashley Reser- |
voir. This Board recognizes the great need of improving this
highway and heartily endorses any efforts which will bring it
about, but it regrets that this Department has only com- |
. paratively small sum which could be devoted for that purpose, even though it should be legitimate expenditure of
water rents, which ought, strictly speaking, to be spent only
on improvements and extensions for the benefit of the water
takers.

Report of the Superintendent.
To THE HonoranLteE Boarp oF WATER COMMISSIONERS :

Gentlemen: have the honor to submit to vou the report of your Superintendent for the vear  .

The consumption of water for the vear was at the rate
of gallons per day per capita, about gallons more than
the rate for the vear previous: the greater part of this inerease being in the quantity used for manufacturing purposes.

The rainfall for the vear was greater than the average
and the level of the reservoirs was high all during the year.

There was more water in storage in all the reservoirs on
November  th of this year than there was on that date in .
any other vear in the history of the department.

There were no unpleasant tastes and odors due to organic
growth and but few complaints of dirty water in the mains.

Considerable more new mains were laid than for any
year since the pre-war period, although the cost of labor and
material was at its peak. All of these extensions were laid
to provide for development. of new tracts exeept the main in |
the City Hospital grounds which was laid to strengthen the
gridiron system in the viemity. Enghty-eight new services,
which is three more than the number last vear, were installed
at an average cost of and one hundred and eleven
services were replaced at an average cost of Six new
hydrants were installed and five hydrants were replaced.

Nothing but maintenance work was done at any of the
reservoirs except the setting out of five thousand white pines
and five thousand seotch seedlings around Ashley Ponds
reservoir in accordance with the policy of reforestation whieh
was adopted several years ago. New gates were erected at
the Kemlworth Castle and Sheldon Avenue entrances to

Whiting Street Reservoir, and it is now possible to restrict |
driving around the reservoir at times when the surface of
the roads would be damaged.

To THe Honoraste Mayor anp Boarp oF ALDERMEN OF THE |
City oF ILOLYOKE:
Gentlemen: We beg to submit for your consideration
and approval the detailed report of Supervisor P. I. Kelly m
of the Holyoke Municipal Playgrounds for the past year. |
Your attention is again called to the needs of eur grounds, :
so that we may obtain the greatest possible returns from
them, and that they be maintained to the highest possible |
standard of efficiency.
We, therefore, heartily endorse the recommendations of ;
Supervisor Kelly: viz, placing our ball fields in best possible
condition, purchasing new apparatus and providing greater
facilities for swimming.
We trust that provision will be made to make these
much needed improvements.
PLAYGROUND COMMISSION,
A. A. BROOKS,
Chairman.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE
- Supervisor of the Holyoke Playgrounds
| FOR  
To THE HONORABLE BoaRD OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS:

Herewith respectfully submit my ninth annual report
as Supervisor of the Holyoke Playgrounds for the season of
 .

The past year has been one of unusual interest and
activity on our playgrounds. The attendance, besides being
larger than any previous year, was distinctly noticeable for
the number of smaller children visiting the playgrounds.
There was an evident decrease in the number of children between the ages of fourteen and sixteen, owing to the fact that
business conditions were such that there was demand for
young boys and girls, and many of those between the ages
mentioned were employed during the day. This also accounts
for the large attendance at the evening sessions during the
past year. believe that the people of Holyoke have been in
closer touch with the affairs of this department, and have
made greater use of the facilities afforded than in any previous year.

It has been source of great satisfaction to note the increasing interest of the citizens in the recreation movement
brought on largely, no doubt, by the fact that organized
recreation played such an important part in the training and
entertainment of our Army and Navy during war-time.
However, feel that as yet the people of Holyoke, as whole,

  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS
do not fully realize what is being done by this department. !
If every organization in the city would send representative, :
| at least once during the year, to visit the different centers !
and report what he sees there, it would be instructive and
would encourage those who are working hard to make recrea”
tion work successful. I. SUPERVISION.
The summer season of our playgrounds opened July  th
. and closed August  th, covering period of eight weeks.
The work was similar to that of other years, which consists
of sewing, damming, crochet work, millinery, story telling,
chair eaning, folk dancing and games. Conducted as follows:
A. At school yards:
Elm Street, Hamilton, Kirtland, Springdale, Morgan
and William Whiting.
B. At public parks: |
Iliehland Park.
C. At publie playgrounds:
Elmwood, Maple Street, Hampden Street, West !
Street and Prospect Field. |
D. At bath houses and baths: |
Ward Four, Whiting School and Holyoke Poys’
Club. |
Our playgrounds offer great variety of activities; thus
children cannot fail to be interested, as is shown by their
response. Each playground adapts itself to the needs of its
own neighborhood; thereby creating better influence for public good and making itself part and parcel of the daily
community life.
The primary aim of playgrounds is to provide, through
various facilities offered, an opportunity for the people,
young and old, to gather for physical improvement and
mental relaxation. With this aim in sight, we try to arrange

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
the program of activities so that all may feel the attachment .
and interest of the playgrounds. .

As measure of promoting efficiency, administration
meetings were held frequently for the discussion of playground topics and the exchange of ideas and experiences
applied to the respective grounds.

II. DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION
FOR GIRLS

All the activities of this department were arranged with
the idea of promoting health, enjoyment, recreation and
sport, consisting of organized games, playground and volley
ball, field athletics and group games.

At the end of the season the girls participated in the
closing field day events. The unusual enthusiasm shown in
all of the activities by the girls was evidence of how thoroughly they enjoyed and appreciated the work.

Great credit is due the directors and their assistants for
the interest shown, also for the able manner in which the
games were presented by them. The activities adopted were
those that provided for the greatest number and catered to
the need of the whole play community.

The beneficial results from this source were three-fold:
first, in creating the desire in the girls for better physical development; second, in arousing their social consciousness of
the rights of others; and third, in making them feel in a
social sense, the need and value of co-operation. To this end
each year we seek to enrich the program, so that our girls
may feel more keenly the attachment of the playgrounds.

»
II. FOLK DANCING
Mary A. McCormick, SUPERVISOR

This department was conducted under somewhat of a

handicap during this past season, because of the illness of

  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS
| Miss McCormick, the elected supervisor, at the opening of
the season. It was impossible for her to fulfill her duties
and her position was filled during the first four weeks by Miss Mary Cronin, the former supervisor, and later by Miss !
Helen Dunn. |
Folk dancing continued to be the most popular activity
for girls. All the playgrounds were visited twice week by |
the supervisor, and one hour each day was devoted to folk |
dancing on each ground. .
} Through the folk dances we have many opportunities to |
educate the social and moral side of the child and to direct
the formation of good habits and high ideals of conduct.
The form of folk dance is as definite as the words of |
a folk song, while the manner in whieh it is daneed and the |
spirit and attitude of the mind, are as definitely part of the
dance as the actual steps and figures. The ‘‘folk manner’’
is of utter simplicity and directness, with no thought of the
appearance presented nor attempt at ‘‘grace’’ or ‘‘daintiness’’. These qualities give folk dancing universal appeal
and make it applicable to our own every day life as an innocent happy form of relaxation and social enjoyment.

, IV. INDUSTRIAL WORK
| BASKETRY AND CHAIR CANING
Miss Bripe C. IlERBERT—SUPERVISOR
Basketry and ehair caning were under the supervision
of Miss Herbert, who deserves creat credit for the work accomplished and the advancement shown in this department.
The success was not alone in the amount of work completed,
but also in the quality of the finished work.
The girls on each playground were divided into two
groups—the elementary and the advanced. With this plan,
and the co-operation of the girls with their teachers, greater
results were aecomplished. Pieture frames, napkin rings,
whisk broom holders and book marks were made by the
younger children. Braided raffia brought forth mats, dolls’
hats, tea-pot mats and baskets. In some eases children used
this braided raffia in the making of articles for their own )
personal use. |
The sewed baskets made of raffia and reed were beautifully designed and proved valuable additions to many
homes. Among these might be mentioned pin trays, pencil
trays, small and large sewing baskets, utility bags, jardinieres and small vases. ,

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  

Pine needle baskets of all shapes and designs were
turned out by the older girls. Pine needles make very attractive basket and were in great demand. In fact more pine
needle baskets were made this year than ever before. Woven reed formed the most attractive trays. For these
trays, wooden base is used and this foundation is made attractive by the use of eretonne and glass. These articles are
both useful and decorative, being made in various sizes and
shapes, to be used as fruit, serving and glass trays.

Chair caning still retains its popularity. visit to any
of our playgrounds during the season will find groups of
boys oeeupied in this class of work. Some of them use this
means in earning considerable pin money. The playground
furnishes the cane and the boys are encouraged to eane as
many chairs as possible.

V. SEWING DEPARTMENT
Mrs. Mary KostreNBADER—SUPERVISOR

This course in sewing on our playgrounds has been
found practical and satisfactory. Every season the interest
in the work increases. The instructions were given daily on
all our play centers. Each plavground was visited once a
week by the supervisor, who plans and designs the work.
The course was practically the same as that of other seasons.

The garments are cut by the girls, either from patterns
or by directions as the teacher deems best. Each process of
construction is followed in logical order until the garment is

. made. The materials selected are those of pleasing color and
good texture. .

The most popular article made this year was the school

bag. They were in great demand by the children. The
- materials used in making these bags were donated by the
Germania Mills Co., to whom we are very grateful.

  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS
Through the faithful co-operation of the directors and
the kindly assistance of the supervisor, sewing is well established on the Holyoke playgrounds. The girls are receiving
valuable instructions under pleasant conditions and gaining
knowledeve as to the use of needle and thimble which will
make them good home workers and desirable citizens in the
eommunity.

VI. EVENING PLAYGROUND SESSION —

. Nothing was more gratifying than the attendance at the
evening sessions. Five playgrounds, Maple Street, West
Street, Elmwood, Hampden Street, and Morgan School
grounds, were open evenings with supervised play from seven
to nine o’eclock, during the months of July and August.
Many younger and older folks who work during the day,
visited our playgrounds and obtained much needed recreation. During the evening hours the baseball diamonds on
the various fields were used exclusively by those who were
employed during the day. Many ‘‘big brothers’’ and visitors

| played in the same games with their smaller brothers and
sisters, while others used the apparatus. The evening sessions
have proved very popular.

During the eight weeks that the playgrounds were open
the total evening attendance was  The average
nightly attendance was  )

VII. PLAYGROUND BASEBALL

To give to every boy an opportunity to play bascball is
one of the problems of playground director. At the beginning of the season three leagues were organized as usual,
the Midect, Junior and Senior leagues. schedule of thirty
frames each was arranged. The Midget league played on
Thursday and Tuesday afternoons. The Junior league games
were played on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings.
And the Senior league played on Monday, Wednesday and
Friday afternoons. The grounds represented were the Elm  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS
wood, Maple Street, William Whiting, Hampden Street,
West Street and Morgan School. !

A total of one hundred and fifty games were
played, representing two hundred and sixteen different boys. Great interest was manifested in each league
and the games were witnessed by thousands of spectators and
friends of the boys. The West Street grounds carried the .
honors in the three leagues this year. }

| VIM. BAND CONCERTS

One of the features which furnished great deal of
pleasure to the public and was appreciated alike by all classes
was the band concerts and moving pictures held on our parks
and playgrounds. They were held on Wednesday evenings

from to P. M., on the Prospeet Field, Elmwoed,
Maple Street, West Street and Springdale Park. The concerts were given by the Holyoke City Band and the Amerjean Legion Band, and were under the supervision of this
board. This arrangement was very satisfactory as permits
for twilight baseball were handled from this office in such a
way that the ball games did not interfere with the band
concerts.

In addition to the concerts, moving pictures were contributed by the Americanization Committee and were in
charge of Mr. F. W. Beaman of the Y. M. C. A. believe
that no other fund provided by the City Government eontributed so much enjoyment to the people as that appropriated for musie on our playgrounds. |

IX. BASEBALL LEAGUES

The great American game of baseball, as might be expected, was the most popular game on our local playgrounds.
During the summer months, our baseball diamonds were in

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
constant use in the afternoons and evenings on week days,
holidays and Sundays.

The past season there were more organized baseball
teams than ever before in the history of baseball in Holyoke.
The City League which has, for number of years, furnished
amusement and recreation on Sunday, for thousands of

. spectators, as the leading league in our city, was somewhat
affected by the. newly formed leagues and was noticeably
weaker than in former years. This league started the season
with eight clubs but soon dwindled down to six and later to
only four clubs. Its schedule was revised and with the most
eareful management it survived through the season.

More permits, for the use of our ball fields, were issued
this season than in the former years, and many requests from
independent teams for the use of our grounds were refused
as all the available diamonds were in use. There is an
urgent need for more baseball diamonds from many sections
of the city.

Following is list of the baseball games played on our
playgrounds, by the different organized leagues and indei] /
pendent teams, together with an estimate of the attendance.
This does not include the Playground League and the hundreds of games played by the youngsters.

XxX. SWIMMING AND BATUIING
This is one branch of our playground department that
is sadly neglected. Tolyoke is going backward in this movement, through no fault of the Playground Commission.
In the year of we had three bath houses under the
; direction of this department, while at the present time we
have but one lone bath house in operation. If there is any
doubt as to the wisdom of providing better swimming facilities, it should be dispelled by the record attendance at this }
one bath house. One of the most enjoyable and health giving
reereations  swimming, and every child should be given the
opportunity to learn to swim. Year after year the building
of more bath houses is suggested but nothing in the way of |
funds to construct them has materialized. |

XI. SKATING RINKS
Skating rinks were maintained at Hampden Street, West
Street, Joseph Metcalf School and Newton Pond. The
weather during the months of January and February was
very bad for skating, but during the month of December al!
of the rinks were open and large crowds enjoyed this healthful sport. Caretakers were placed in charge of each rink
keeping them in the best of condition, and great eare was
taken to prevent accidents.

XII. ATTENDANCE :

This is the most pleasing part of my report, as the popularity of our playgrounds is evidenced by the large number of
children that visit our grounds daily. This serves as an excellent index to the feeling of children in regards to the playgrounds.

NIII. SPECIAL EVENTS ,
It is our aim each year to hold number of special
events during the playground season. The events held are all
worthy of mention. At the opening of the season meeting
of the directors and workers was held at the playground
office and plans were talked over to stimulate and increase the |
attendance. It was planned to hold such events as Mothers’
Day, Carnival Day, Dolls’ Day and Baby Carriage Parade. 
The results were very gratifying. Each director planned her
own program and looked after all of the details. At some of
the events other grounds were invited to visit and take part
 "with them. The Baby Carriage Parade proved the most
popular event held. It was first planned to hold one hig
parade for all the grounds combined, at Hampden Park, but
this arrangement was abandoned and each ground held their

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
own Baby Parade. This plan proved very satisfactory as it
gave each section of the city an opportunity to witness a
baby parade in its own vicinity. ,

XIV. FIELD DAY AND PICNIC

It is customary each year to hold large Field Day the
last week of the playground season. The experiment last
season, of holding picnic in connection and permitting the
girls to take part in the events, proved so successful that the
same plan was carried out this season. The event was held
at Springdale Park, Wednesday, August  th.

This Field Day is looked forward to with great interest,
as all compete for the championship ef the city in their respeetive divisions—the Midgets, Juniors and Seniors. The events
consisted of potato races, return races, and relay races, together with forty, sixty, and eighty-vard dashes. Prizes were
awarded the winners of first, second and third p:aces in each
event. The prizes were donated by S. Davis Sons, Thos.
S. Childs, A. Steiger Co., C. E. Walker Co., and the Osborne Hardware Co., to whom we are very grateful.

Six playgrounds were represented and the ground scoring the greatest number of points received silver cup. This
was presented by the Playground Commission and was won
by the Maple Street Playground.

XV. PLAYGROUND STAFF

The successful operation of our playgrounds is due partly
to the splendid co-operation of the directors and the workers
in charge. Their effective work in organizing teams, teaching
athletics and games and promoting play in all features, added
materially to the usefulness of the playgrounds.

They are inspired by high motives and have earnestly
striven to help the children, through the playground activi  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COM MISSIONERS
ties, to robust physical health and strength, and the formation
of right habits of conduct. The hours of the workers were
divided into shifts so that the vamous centers might carry
' on their programs during the mornings, afternoons and evenings. This accommodates the younger children and ‘‘little
. mothers’’ in the earlier periods, permitted quiet imterests dur, ing the heat of the day, encouraged the participation on the
, part of the older girls and boys in the late afternoon and of

the adults in the evening. 
XVI. RECOMMENDATIONS

This brings to mind the most vital needs of the department forthe coming year. Very few improvements have been
made on our playgrounds during the past three years. This
is due to the fact that the appropriation granted the Playground Commission has not been sufficient to meet the upkeep
or permit any improvements. There are three things of vital
importance which should be attended to.

First—The need of better swimming facilities. At the
present time we have but one bath house where children can
swim. This is located in Ward Four and there is an urgent
demand for more bath houses in other sections of the city. |

I would suggest that special appropriation be asked for this
‘purpose and at least one bath house be erected each year until
all sections are provided for.

. Sond—Apparatus. Most of the apparatus on our playgrounds, such as swings and slides, are out of date and sadly
in need of repairs. Some of the apparatus has been in use
for several vears and instead of spending money on repairs,
I suggest that provisions be made to install new and up-todate equipment.

Third—Baseball and Football Fields. In my last report, .
attention was called to the condition of our play fields, i. e.,
Elmwood, Maple Street, West Street, and Prospect Field.

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
These fields are in very poor condition and are in need of .
) repairs. recommend that these grounds be put in proper
condition. They should be re-loamed, leveled and re-surfaced.
XVII. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Valuable assistance was rendered the playground movement during the past season. We restate our appreciation
for the co-operative spirit manifested by the other eity departments. Particularly, the School Board, for granting the
use of school buildings and grounds for play purposes. The
Park Board is to be commended for its generous co-operation
in permitting the use of parks for play and band concerts.

A word of thanks must be extended also to the Holyoke Water
Power Company for the use of the Berkshire Street grounds .
for baseball, and to the A. Steiger Co., Thos.  Childs, Inc.,
S. Davis Sons, and to the Osborne Hardware Co., for their
generosity in furnishing prizes for the Baby Show and Field
Day. Also to the Germania Mills Co., for the gift of cloth

 which furnished many children with school bags.

In closing my report, wish to thank the Playground
staff and employees for their hearty co-operation.

I feel grateful and appreciative to the Playground Commission, who have so willingly given their time to working
out the details for the development of our playgrounds, which
means so much for the healthy growth of the vouth of the
city. To Mr. M. J. Gleason, our Playground Superintendent,
I am very grateful for his ever-ready and willing assistance.
Also to the press—the Holyoke Transcript and Telegram,
Springfield Republican and Union—which was most generous
In giving space and news for our city’s playgroui:ds.

: PART II.
REPORT OF THE SCHOOL BOARD.
To His Honor, the Mayor, and the Citizens of Holyoke:

The School Board respectfully submits herewith this
Annual Report for the calendar year of  It is merely
a summary of the more important activities and recommendations of the Board. For fuller and more complete
account you are referred to the reports of the Superintendent of Schools and his assistants.

FOREWORD.

An usually large number of important matters were
presented to the School Board during the past year for
action. They inelude questions of sehool finanee, school
policies, and school administration. Of necessity, these

, questions required many meetings, much thought and individual investigation on the part. of the members. In addition to the regular monthly meetings and sub-committee
meetings, the Board sat in special session ten times to consider problems which pressed for solution. Many of the
votes taken represented sharp departures from the past, and
will long leave their mark on the conduct of our schools.
All of these questions cannot be outlined here, but among
the more important are the following:

SCHOOL FINANCE. .

The question of school finance, which is always of major
importance, this vear offered peculiar difficulties. At the
outset the city government, though under serious embarrassREPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
ment itself, granted the Department an appropriation
substantially larger than that given in any other year.
Immediately after, the School Board encountered an almost
endless chain of requests and petitions for imereases in

salary. In considering these requests, the members tried to
be as discriminating and conservative as possible, though it
soon became apparent that, in all fairness, the salaries of
teachers and other employees must be increased. Then, too,
the cost of maintenance grew by leaps and bounds, until it
became well-nigh impossible to live within the original appropriation. Through the generous cooperation of the Board
of Aldermen, however, certain transfers of funds were made,
which enabled the Board to meet all of its obligations, and 
to close its books for the year, having spent the imposing
sum of .

SCHOOL SALARIES.

The most persistent question before the Board during
the year was that of school salaries. Early in the year it
was voted to accept the principle of equal pay for equal
work, and during period of two months women teachers
in the High School received the same salaries as men
teachers. Later, however, the members deemed it advisable
to rescind this vote. Then, in response to general petition
from the teachers, countersigned by several thousand citizens,
the Board granted straight  increase in salary to every
full time teacher. The result of this action has been to place
our elementary teachers in the rank of the highest paid in
the country, and Holyoke’s salary schedules are attracting
the attention of the entire state. It is interesting to note at this
point the percentage of increase that has been granted each
group of teachers over the maximum pre-war salaries of  .
Kindergartners increase  elementary teachers increase grammar grade (Junior High School) teachers
  High School women High School men  .

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
SCHOOL BUILDINGS.

The Board has found plenty of opportunity during the
year to carp at the condition of the school buildings. So
vreat was the irritation felt at times, that movement to
transfer the responsibility and control of the repair and 
maintenance of school property from the Board of Public
Works has erystallized. On paper the plan of investing a
special board with the care of all public buildings seems
ideal; bunt practically the schools have suffered. There they
stand, with the antiquated equipment and appurtenances of
another day; without lights, with inadequate or dangerous .
heating systems, with unelean or broken walls, with rickety
window-frames, leaky roofs and nauseating sanitaries. The
process alone which must be gone through in order to get
even minor repair is in itself diseouraging.

No amount of argument can exeuse these conditions.
From financial standpoint, the continued neglect is costing ,
the city many dollars in the depreciation of public property ;

| educationally, it is apparent in the impaired efficiency of the
schools.
SCHOOL ACCOMMODATIONS.

For some time past, it has been rather generally recognized that several of our school buildings are inadequate, and
that the children of certain districts are improperly housed.
Other Boards have taken cognizance of this situation, but out
of deference to certain fallacy regarding school expense,
did not press the issue. However, the day of construction
eannot long be delaved. The conditions in the central seetion
are notoriously bad, while some relief must be found for the
Highland and South Holvoke distriets. The erection of the
new two-room rural school in Smiths Ferry will not have
any perceptible effect on the general situation. It is the
reeommendation of this Board that courageous and forward
looking building program be immediately formulated, that

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
will start with the construction of the much talked of new
Lawrence Junior High School.
| CONTINUATION SCHOOL.

The establishment of proper Continuation School for
employed miners between the ages of and  as required
by Chapter of the Acts of the Massachusetts Legislature
of  has been vexatious problem, which changes and
transfers as to the local board of control have served to
retard and complicate. In reviewing the development of this
project, we find that in the beginning the chief obstacles in
the path of suecessful Continuation School were two,
namely space and money. Both of these were physical wants
which this Board of itself could not hope to dispel. How
to find accommodations for school with an enrolment of
approximately pupils in system where there is seareely
enough room for ordinary needs, except in the outlying districts, waS perplexing enigma. The question has been
settled temporarily by housing the school in different buildings throughout the city; the girls in the Park Street School,
and the boys in the High and West Street Schools. This
arrangement cannot be permanent, however, sinee it interferes too much with the program for the regular day schools.
Next year’s Board must give plenty of thought to the Continuation School. .

AMERICANIZATION.

In common with other cities, this Board accepted the
provision of Chapter of the Acts of and embarked
on program of Americanization. director of Americanization was named and full time teacher elected. The cooperation of local civic bodies and local industries was
enlisted, factory classes, neighborhood classes, evening school
classes and special classes organized, and the project so developed that today Holyoke stands out as recognized leader
in this work. Indeed at several State conventions Holyoke

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
was referred to as the banner Americanization city of New
‘England. The School Board rejoices in the eminence which
the city has thus attained, and recommends that future
boards take up the matter even more inténsively. The business of making all people good American citizens must con stitute the foremost aim of public education.
EVENING HIGH SCHOOL.

The Sehool Board eannot conceal the satisfaction which
it feels in the rapid growth and expansion of the evening
high school. Every effort has been expended to make this

school as attractive as possible for the public of whatever age.

The rule of the Board has been to conduct classes in any :
subject in which an enrolment of eight could be maintained.
Work is given in academic subjects, in commercial work, in
cooking and in manual training, and several special classes
not ineluded in these classifications. But the finest classes
are those that are preparing men and women for American
citizenship. These classes are well attended, containing
representatives from every group of our foreign born element,
and are cooperating with the United States Bureau of Naturalization.

The present large enrolment. of pupils in the school
indicates the great interest of the public for further educational opportunities and the duty of the School Board to
serve not merely the children of the city but also the adults
in this respect.

SCHOOL ORGANIZATION, .

The reorganization of the school svstem begun in  ,
was completed this vear, and the plan of sehool organization substituted for the old grammar grade arrangement. This is in line with what either has been done or is
now being down im all the progressive communities of the
country. There are now five distmiet junior high schools in
the city, each centrally located to meet the needs of the

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
different sections. Hereafter only three years will be required to complete course of study in the Senior High
School.

Another practical innovation introduced this year was
the double session plan for kindergartens. It is too early yet
to forecast the results of this experiment, but it is heartening to know that it has already commanded the attention and
earnest commendation of the United States Bureau of Edueation at Washington.

| MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. |

The Medical Department was amended in two important
particulars. First of all, school nurse was added to the
staff, and then Dr. St. Georges was promoted to fill the position of Dr. Harold E. Miner, resigned, as full time Medical
Director. In the interests of economy, the position of school
physician, formerly held by Dr. St. Georges was abolished.

Under this arrangement the Board feels that the sehools
are amply protected against the spread of contagious diseases,
while the nurses, through their follow-up work, will do much
to remedy gross conditions,

It is sincerely hoped that next vear will see the introduction of dental dispensary the sehools. The plan for
this work has been completed, and all that is necessary is —
affirmative action by the Board.

The picture on the next page, of typieal medical inspection exercise in the classrooms, is illustrative of this
phase of our child welfare work.

ADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOOL AFFAIRS.

Our schools are our greatest institutious and their administration is trust of no small moment. At the present
time the Holyoke Schools are giving Holyoke ehildren the
best education available within the limits of the money at
the disposal of the School Board.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

The School Committee are profoundly sensitive of their
duties and their responsibilities. They have always sought
to transact the business of the schools in an honorable and an
efficient manner. Social, political, personal, nepotic, and |

; other unworthy considerations never furnished basis for
action. Every vote passed has been done so with full appreciation of its consequences,

In discharging responsibility of such primary importance, it is inevitable that some criticism should attend
their actions. This the Board welcomes as token of public

| interest. Healthy criticism must react to the benefit of the
schools. On the other hand criticism based on prejudice,
lack of information or erass ignorance is fraught with harm
and mischief.

The business of the schools is of most engrossing
nature, and in the handling of the multitudinous questions
that come before the Board, differences of opinion naturally
arise. Tlowever, in reaching final decisions the Board has’
been wont to disregard selfish interests and to eonsult only
the welfare of the school children and of the community.
In following such policy, the members feel that they are
best carrying out their missions as public servants.

Respectfully submitted,
NATITAN P. AVERY,

A .
. PART III
REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT.
To the School Board of Holyoke:

In accordance with vour rules, have the honor to submit my first annual report as Superintendent of Schools for
the vear  This is the fifty-seventh volume in the
series of printed reports issued by the School Board.

FOREWORD.

 Immediately following his) promotion, your Superin-tendent undertook an examination of the system’ to which he
had become the responsible head. His findings are satis- .
factory. He discovered therein an organization in splendid
working order, corps of teachers unsurpassed in traming
and in experience, and course of study thoroughly practical
and up-to-date. By every token, our schools deserve to rank
among the highly efficient.

He was particularly careful to investigate certain apprehensions regarding the presence of ‘‘educational fads’’ in

- the sehool curriculum. He found none. Criticisms on that
score, at least. are eratuitiously made. Pertinent eriticism
would deal more with what is not in the schools rather than
with what is. Imperfections do exist, and in several important respects the work is) cireummsenbed by conditions
wholly beyond the repair of an exacting supervision, But in the main our schools are tribute to the teachers and
administrators who have developed them. Holyoke may well
feel proud of its svstem. Parents may confidently believe
that their children are receiving the best edueation obtainREPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
able, and that every moment is profitably employed; taxpayers can suppose that they are reaping handsome return 
on their investment.

SCHOOL MEMBERSIIIP.

The school attendanee records show that on December  ,
 there were pupils in our schools. This number
represents gain of approximately per cent, or to be more
exact, of pupils over the membership of year avo.
These figures invite comparison, wo per cent has long been
regarded as proper and normal rate of inerease in the publie schools, as against this vear’s per eent. The gain of
  pupils is equivalent to full classrooms of pupils to
a room, or greater than the enrolment of such schools as the
Kirtland School or the Sargeant Street School. This eam,
is the more satisfying because it was accomplished without

the addition of single teacher in-fact there are now  less
terchers in the schools than there were year ago.

There are more pupils in our sehools today than at auy
time sinee December when we reached the high
record of pupils. On December  there were  
more pupils in the schools than on December while

the total shows loss of pupils. Evidently we have
recovered from the slump experienced im that year and have
fairly entered upon period of normal healthy growth.

The Wilham Whitine and the West Street Sehools made
the best record among the schools with an  inerease of  
pupils each. Here again we have cause for rejoicing, sinee
the enrolment of both of these schools has been declining at
an alarming rate in recent years. In the South Holyoke
district there are more pupils attending school than
there were year ago. In Elmwood and Oakdale substantial
though less striking gaims are noted, and the Liehland
Sehool, though already overerowded, is taking care of  
more pupils than in  The High School reports loss

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
of pupils, but this was rather expected as one of the prob' able effects of the Junior High School. Due to the transfer
of the seventh and eighth grades to Morgan School, there
. was falling off of pupils in Springdale. The central
and outlying districts show about the same attendance.

We ean see in these figures the operation of the new
state law requiring children to complete the sixth grade
before receiving an employment certificate. This same law
will act to fill our elementary schools to overflowing. We
must consider whether we have sufficient seating aeceommodations to provide for them. |

SCHOOL FINANCE.

During the fiseal vear ending November this
Department expended Of this sum 
Was used in the payment of salaries, and  was
spent for supplies. The eoming year it is conservatively
estimated that  will be required to run our day
schools alone, and an additional  for the Continuation
School, one-half of the latter to be refunded by the State.
This large increase In running expenses is due chiefly to the
general salary revision of the past year, calling for an inerease of  for each teacher, and smaller imereases for
nearly every other employee. Advancing prices, inability to
obtain bids, ete., cost the city heavily in purehasing supplies.
It would seem as though the peak of maintenance and operation costs had been reached and that policy of retrenchment
is in order. It is true that our city spends its money for no
better purpose than education, but still we must remember
that there are many other municipal activities entirely
essential to the life of the community, which must be maintained.

SCHOOL ACCOMMODATIONS.

This threatens to become the chief administrative problem of the Department. It has already been pointed out
that the school membership increased per cent during the

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
past twelve months. While this rate has not been constant,
and is likely to be lower in future vears, nevertheless we are
facing situation of serious congestion unless measures are
taken to offset it. Recent State legislation has placed a
heavy tax on our accommodations. The compulsory Continuation School is oeeupying elassrooms urgently needed
for regular school purposes, and changes in the employment
law, which will -have more marked effect as time goes on.
may be expected to require more grades in the elementary
schools. |

Our seating accommodations at the present time are not
sufficient. Two hundred and thirty-two children are loeated
in attic or overflow rooms that are wholly inadequate. The
average size of classroom in the eity proper is pupils,
a number mueh too large to combine, and there are classes
with membership of over pupils, the super-maximum
number whieh all educators agree should, under any eireumstances, be seated in an elementary sehool room. Save in
the outlying district of Sprinedale, there is not single elassroom available for expansion, for speeial classes, or for probable inereases in population.
Disiricts seeking relief are the Central, the South Holvoke and the Wighlands. In the eentral district the South )
Chestnut Street Sehool, which is loeated in the heart of a
large tenement area, has lone been unable to aeeommodate )
the children living there. About seventy children that
belong to this sehool are now attending the Morgan School,
adding to the attendance problem in that) district. The
small classrooms of the Elm Street Sehool are crowded to
capacity, While in the Wilham Whiting School there are few
seats to spare. and these only in the upper grades. In South
Holvoke classes have been combined and consolidated to the
limit+in order to make room for the Continuation Sehool,
while in the Highlands overflow classrooms are even now in
service, to take care of the fast growing population of that
district.

/
  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

From an educational standpoint, our schools are not
satisfactory because they are lacking in most of those faeilities which are regarded as necessary in modern school systems. In all our elementary schools there is but one
auditorium, and that in the Ilamilton Street School. The
few shops in our Junior Tigh Schools are found in poorly
ventilated basement rooms, while there are no properly fitted
scienee rooms, eooking rooms or sewing rooms. In the
Morgan School, for example, the sewing room has been
crowded into teachers’ rest-room.

The physieal condition of the buildings, too,  poor.
The use of the Lawrence School, of course, is indefensible.
The Tigh School is dirty and neelected. Our elementary
schools have often been foreed to suspend work because of
the absence of electric lights. The eross lehts playing
through the small window panes of the Hamilton Street
School are severe and distracting, and the heating apparatus
of the Nonotuck Street School is constant source of anxiety.

Since the Joseph Metealf School was built in  not
a schoolfonse has been ereeted by the city. Of the nineteen

. buildings now under our control, ten have been standing
over quarter of century, while six of these were ereeted
over vears ago. In the decade between and  ,
three buildines were construeted, while between  and
 far-seeine city officials directed) the building of five
schools. Certainly it seems as though the time had eome
again to continne the work of those ten vears.

To remedy these conditions will) require considerable
expense and thoughtful planning, but no temporary patehwork will meet the situation. Some sort of building proeram must be adopted. As aio fundamental poliey this
program should seek the elimination of the small school as
a cheaper and more efficient arrangement. It should ecommenee with the construction of the new Lawrenee Junior
Tigh School—a eombined elementary and intermediate school

: REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
—large enough to replace both the South Chestnut Street
and the old Lawrence building, and to reheve somewhat the
Elm Street School. It must contemplate the erection of a
new elementary building in the Ilighlands, one capable of
replacing the present Nonotuek Street School, and of caring
for the large influx into that district. It should comprehend
the erection of large elementary building in South IHolyoke
that will permit the abandoning of the Park Street Sehool
and Sargeant Street School. It must make allowance for
two-room rural schoolhouses in Siniths Ferry and West Ifolvoke. These arrangements seem elaborate, but they are
necessary. For if we are to clinch our investment, if we are
to eliminate congestion, and provide adequate seating aceommodations and proper school facilities for our children, we
must prepare to take up this matter imtelligently.

KINDERGARTENS.

With the general increase in teachers’ salaries everywhere throughout the eountry, there came the question of
the proper use of kindergarten teachers’ time in the afternoon, It was question quite pertinent to our city, since
kindergartners for vears had not been responsible for any
afternoon work. After considering several expedients, we
decided to try the double session, This was contrary to pted theory and practice. Still if hygienic conditions were
richt, that is to say. if the amount of activity eould be
reculated, and if the children were enjoying enough rest,
food, and fresh air, there did not seem to be any serious
objection tothe plan. It might even help to solve the problem
of the neglected child, whose mother must be away all day
at work. Accordingly the experiment was entered into.
Oniv the older kindergarten) ehildren were permitted to
return in the afternoon. We also decided to allow smalt
groups of first @rade ehildren to participate in the kinderearten activities of the afternoon, for we felt that these
children, too, should have some of the advantages of the

— REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

equipment and the floor space of the kindergarten room and
of the kindergartner’s special training in activities that do
not relate primarily to reading.

| It is yet too early to report the entire suss of the
scheme. It is sufficient to explain that mothers seem to have
accepted the new arrangement without reserve. Our kindergarten membership has increased over per cent in the past
year, and in several districts where the kindergarten at- ,
tendanee was always very low, waiting lists are now resorted ;
to. The plan has likewise been reviewed by the National
Bureau of Education, and has received this commendation
from Miss Julia Wade Abbott of that Department, that we
‘fare working out our plan for double session in the kindergarten in Holyoke in very wise manner.’’

. ELEMENTARY DAY SCHOOLS.

These comprise the most important grades in the sehool
system, since it is during these years that the foundation of
the echild’s education is laid. system of schools will be
sussful only in proportion to the strength or weakness of
the first six grades. Hence it is gratifying to report the execllent progress of the work being done in them in our city.

With the introduction of the Junior High Sehool and
the elimination of the  th grade, it became necessary to
revise the entire course of study in the elementary schools.

. This work has been eompleted. Much review work and
many formal exercises have been eliminated, and the courses
greatly enriched by the addition of subject matter formerly
reserved for later vears, 

Many changes have also been made in classroom methods.
The old) formal teaching is giving way gradually to the
socialized form of recitation, the projeet-problem method of
presentation, and the supervised study period. These changes
for the most part have been brought about through the able
supervision of Miss Seollev. They must surely result in
better pupils and improved standards everywhere throughout
the school system.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL.

This is our most engrossing educational concern, When
the Junior High School was first introduced in our city in
 it was regarded as great adventure. The reaction of
the community to the innovation, however, was not unanimous, Many people accustomed to refer any suggestion of
change back to some fact within their own experience shook
their heads. Others, more familar with eontemporaneous
educational thought, saw in the move only the elements ‘of
progress. |

The Junior High School has now passed the purely experimental stage. It is daily proving its right to survive, by
surviving. Ninety per cent of the school systems of the
country have adopted the Jumor Tigh Sehool under one

form or another; and to come even closer, practically every
city and town in the State of Massachusetts has ‘embraced
the movement. ‘‘So far as know,’’ writes one superintendent, ‘‘all state departments of education, all teachers’ associations, principals’ associations, and superintendents’ associations, have endorsed the plan.” All of which attests to the
judgment of those responsible for its adoption in our city,
and offers rather trustworthy evidenee that any step away .
from this form of organization would be distinetly reactionary.

The chief aim of the Junior High School is not to save
time, aS many suppose, by reduemg the number of vears in
our school system from thirteen to twelve, or by abolishing
one grade in the elementary schools. In itself that would
be worthy end and defensible one. For nowhere outside
of New England did it seem necessary to require children to
finish nine grades in the elementary schools.

But the Junior High Sehool seeks to accomplish more
than that; its underlying principle is one of vocational
guidance. The Junior High Sehool represents conseious
attempt to uneover to ‘a pupil his speeial abilities and

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

aptitudes, his interests and his predilections. It is the exploratory period in child’s edueation, the period during
which the child tries to find himself, to attain certain facts
about different studies, courses, or even pursuits in life which
will enable him to make an intelligent selection of those best
suited to him. It has many other advantages, such as saving
of time, retaining of pupils, affording better teaching, bridging the gap between the elementary and the high school, ete.,
but all of these are subsidiary to the great principle of ‘vocational enidance.

The Junior High School seeks to accomplish its great
objective by introducing in the last three years of the
elementary schools certain basic secondary school subjects.
All of these subjects have an approved value, so that whether
the pupil pursues them to greater or less extent, he must
benefit through them. In thus bringing in to the elementary

, curriculum secondary school subjects, however, no detail of
the child’s) primary training is omitted. Every subject
hitherto considered fundamental to the edueation of children
of that age and development is retained. Only those subjects
are abridged and shorn, as it were, of all sham and artifice.
Wasteful and discouraging reviews are eliminated, duplication of work, formal exercises and every extravagant motion of
the old eonventional nine-grades system is avoided. As a
consequenee, in leu of the elaboration of elementary school
subjects, secondary subjects of sound practical value are introduced to take the place of that whieh was purely artificial.

| Of course many objections have been raised against the

Junior Tigh School, the most potent of which seems to be

| the cost. It is true that the Junior High Sehool organization

does mean increased school expenditures, because it involves

smaller classes, greater variety of subjects, and more equipment. Put the advantages of the school are great enough to
overbalanee any Inerease in cost that it entails. REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

The project, as it has been established and is now working out in our system, is good one. It was ineorporatzd as
an integral part of the organization in quiet conservative
way, and with minimum of friction. Certain changes have
been made during the course of the year, and other changes
are contemplated which will doubtless add to its effeetiveness. For example, this vear we moved to safeguard the supervision of the secondary school subjects in the Junior FHigh
School by extending the supervision of the department heads
in the Senior High Sehool downward through the seventh,
eighth and ninth grades. We plan now to modify the pro- gram of subjects. and to change the time schedule, so as to
more closely realize the peculiar funetion of voeational
enidance.

The program of the Junior division should be devoted
exclusively to try-out period in shop and household art
work. The program of the Junior HI division should eontain foreign language as means of testing the child’s lanenage ability, or commercial subject for try-out in that
particular phase of edueation. The Junior ITIL division
should see the fruition of the entire plan with different
courses of study, viz., language course, commercial course,
and an industrial and household arts eourse, each containing
enough common subjects to permit of an easy transfer from
one to the other. These courses would be selected by the pupil on the basis of work done in the preceding two years. A
pupil passing through such training might be expected to
enter the Senior Iligh School prepared for intensive work.
The time schedule of the Junior High Sehool should provide
for six periods rather than the present arrangement of seven
 -minute periods, and more attention should be given to
such eultural subjeets as musie and art. When these changes
have been accomplished we ean perhaps more easily perceive
the true merits of the Junior Tligh Sehool.

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL.

Our Senior Iligh School has, for many years, held a
high scholastic standing. Its certificate has long been accepted for admission to the normal schools and colleges, while

its graduates in these institutions have been more than ordi| narily successful.

The aim of the Senior High School is to produce leaders,
leaders in the professions, leaders in the business world, and
m citizenship. The courses are planned to educate broadminded men and women with confidence in themselves and
eager to be of some service to mankind. The different de. partments of the High School are organized for intensive
work; the academie and technical departments to prepare
bovs and girls for higher institutions, or for voeation; the
commercial department to meet the demands of the city for.
competent clerical and stenographie help. The social life of
the school is well regulated and is centered in various student
organizations, each furnishing an ineentive for much individual and purposeful work. In short, the general atmosphere of our Ihgh Sehool bespeaks traming, culture and refinement.

HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY.

One of the finest marks of progress in our entire school
svstem is the growth of the High School Library. When
Miss Lillian W. Fav in was put in charge of this work.
the library was an unimportant and little-used school accessory. It eontained about thousand inappropriate or obsolete volumes, most of which had to be discarded. Under her
direction the library has become vital factor in the aecomplishment of the work of the school. It has about  
reference books and magazines, all of which have been earefully selected, not merely for their intrinsic value, but for
peculiar adaptability to the need of the pupils and of the

. departments.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
The most helpful phase of the library work is the ref-.
erence work done in the library. That the teachers and pupils alike recognize the value of this work ig shown from the |
fact that approximately two hundred pupis use the library
daily. The lbrary has no circulating feature, because its
books are far too precious and in tuo great demand to allow
them to be out for more than twenty-four hours. One of the
very practical benefits of the library is the training and instruction which the pupils receive in library usage. Gradually they become accustomed to the ecard eatalogue, Poole's
Index, the Readers’ Guide, and the book index. Standard
forms of elassifving, listing and catalogueig books are emploved so that the pupils are able to help themselves in the
city library. As one boy remarked, ‘‘A fellow doesn't have —
, to hunt all over creation for book if he knows what those
little cards and numbers mean.’’ |
The school library is greatly indebted to the city library
for its loan of fiction books, biographies and essays. As
soon as it is practicable, the Department should endeavor
to purehase these books for itself. In return we hope that. |
the eireulation of the eity Hbrary will be augmented and that
a reading publie will come to appreciate and use intelligently the avenues of knowedge which the eity library holds
for them.
SPECIAL DEPARTMENTS.
Appended to this report may be found excerpts from
the al statements to the Superintendent of the supervisors of special departments. Your Superintendent has personally investigated the conditions mentioned therein, and  s
quite ready to coneur in nearly every recommendation. As
a good business poliey, if for no other reason, we should see
to it that our special teachers are given sufficient time and
equipment to accomplish the results they are seeking.
EVENING SCHOOLS. .
For several vears past the attendance at the evening
elementary schools has been unsatisfactory, and this year’s

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
figures show only meager increase over those of year agu.
Still, improvement is noted. The number of illiterates and
non-English speaking foreigners over years of age is
larger, while the number of voluntary pupils,  e., minors
possessing at least fourth-grade education (hereafter a
sixth-grade education) has decreased. This latter condition
is probably due to the compulsory Continuation School, private educational projects, and the change in the employment
laws. The Evening Iligh School, however, with its variety
of subjects and opportunities for special work, continues to
attract goodly numbers,

In connection with the Americanization movement, eriticism has been made of the character of the teaching and the
methods emploved in the English elasses for foreigners im
evening schools. It has been charged that the teaching
lacked direction, that it smacked too much of the primary
erades, and henee was unsuited to ‘‘grown-ups,’’ and that
the foreigner in the evening schools was being ‘‘exploited.”’
In order to safeguard our evening schools against this charge,
the Enelish classes have been organized as Ameriecanization
elasses under the direction of trained Americanization teachers, all of whom hold state certificates. This poliey has not
only strengthened our evening sehools, but carries with it
the added advantare of securing reimbursement from the
State under Chapter of the General Acts of  ,

. CONTINUATION SCILOOL.

Tlis is combination educational and welfare project,

which the Department is committed to maintain under Chap ter of the General Acts of the Legislature of  By
the provisions of this act, all empldyed minors between the
aves of and are required to attend school at least four
hours week, between the hours of and in the morning,
and and in the afternoon on any week day except Saturday. About children in our city are affected,

‘

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
The task of providing profitable courses of study for
these pupils is no easy one. Your Superintendent has followed the lead of those responsible for this movement in orvanizing general improvement and pre-vocational classes for
both boys and girls. These include woodworking elasses for
the boys, sewing classes for the girls, and commercial classes
for both groups. Plans for the coming year eall for an additional pre-vocational printing shop for the boys and an extension of the household art work for the girls.
For obvious reasons such school as this should be lo) eated elose to the industrial seetion. Moreover, it should be
located in building devoted exclusively to part-time work
instead of in scattered rooms throughout the schools. The
Park Street Sehool building, both as to eonstruetion and Jocation, is admirably suited for Continuation School purposes.
Ifowever, we cannot think of giving up this building or of
even continuing the present arrangements through another
vear without seriously impeding the work of the regular day
schools. The quickest and most practical solution of the
housing problem of the Continuation Sehool would be to eonvert the rear of the assembly room in the Ilamilton Street
Sehool building into elassrooms sufficient to eare for the
girls’ division. Unless some arrangement of this kind is decided upon and earried through, we will soon be eonfronted
with overflow conditions everywhere throughout the South

IIolyvoke district. .
TEACHERS’ SALARIES.

The act of the School Board in granting to every teacher
a  merease in salary will long be remembered as one of
the most important developments in the history of the Holyoke schools. Our salary schedule, though always in keeping with those of other cities of its size, will now compare
most favorably in its mnimums and maximums with many
of the most advanced in the United States. This is espeelally true coneerning the salaries paid to our elementary

. zs
  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
school teachers, for not even many of our capital cities can
boast of the generous maximum of  year. The salaries of our principals, supervisors and high school teachers,
however, do not bear the same relation to those paid in other
cities. .

The teachers have many reasons to be grateful. The
professional character of their work has been finally recognized and they have been vouchsafed not merely living
wave, but wage that will enable them to engage in cultural
pursuits and to open up savings account for the future.
The people have shown great faith in them. Several thousand eitizens and taxpayers subscribed to their salary petition for  increase, and the same general sentiment favored the special school appropriation of approximately ,. needed to make that increase operative during the
months of May, June, September, October and November.
Approximately,  will be added to the school budget
to pav these salaries during the coming year.

The public, however, expect. large returns on their new
investment. The teachers must give back to the city more
than one hundred cents for every dollar spent for school purposes in the form of boys and girls better trained for citizenship. The School Board and the public have done their part ;
the teachers will not fail to perform their trust. THE COMING YEAR.

Under the head of specific reeommendations for the ecoming vear, your Superintendent wishes to include the followIng:

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
. append herewith the annual report of the Assistant
Superintendent, Miss Jennie E. Scolley :
Lo the Superintendent of Schools: .

I herewith submit brief report of some phases of my
work for the past vear. .

SUPERVISION,

In the general supervision of the work of the elementary
schools, report marked progress in every branch.

The active interest shown by the teaching foree in the
development of modern educational methods and praetices
Is most praiseworthy. )

The work of the teachers, in the main, shows professional attitude, unity of purpose and an understanding
of school policies and ideals.

The results achieved) prove an understanding of the
course of study, the goal it sets up. and the principles under- —lying it.

Emphasis was given certain phases of classroom istruetion during the past vear with worthy results, namely:
supervised study, interpretive reading and the socialized
recitation. The Enehsh work in the grades shows great provement; the oral English periods have been better  organized.

This year, as during the past, much attention will be
given to teaching methods. The teaching of the various subjects alone the ‘‘project-problem"* plan, which holds strong
possibilities for more effective teaching in all educational subjects, will be eneouraged. The advantages of this method
are that it carries over the child’s interests from his world
outside to the schoolroom, that it is In harmony with laws
governing his growth, and that it  fitting him for problem. solving and for living in co-operation with his fellows.

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
Teachers’ meetings were held at various times and were }
‘ of three kinds: general, group and grade. The purposes of
 such meetings are to lay out and discuss and elaborate
subject matter and methods; to develop unity and cooperative effort; to secure sympathy with and an un| derstanding of new project; to give directions about
things requiring uniformity—routine procedure—habits that
save time; to present for discussion criticisms applicable
to groups both favorable or unfavorable with their underly| ing principles; for demonstration work.
THE KINDERGARTEN. :

- The keynote of education all over the country is experimentation—discovery of new methods, policies and equipments. This year is to be one of experimentation in kinder' garten policies, methods and activities. We are studying the
: various local problems, investigating methods and standards
in various cities, and spending some time in observation, discussion and conferences. .

Edueators everywhere are giving attention to this question, and it will be of interest to compare results of these
investigations. |

The kindergarten should be considered vital integral
part of our school system. There must be closer co-ordination between the kindergarten and the first grade. Modern
methods must be introduced in systematic and professional
way. There must be on the part of all connected with the
work thorough knowledge of the little child, the methods
used and the goal to reach.

The kindergarten work needs to be reorganized so as to
show its own lines of work form the foundation of that which
is to follow. ‘‘The kindergarten should take the child to the
point where interest becomes intense in the use of signs to
represent language—to the psychological age where the pas, sion for reading begins. It is the psychological age and not
the chronological age which should determine the change.”’

) REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

It is also true that first-grade teachers should understand the pedagogy of the kindergarten, thereby aiding in

that perfect adjustment so much desired. The integrity of

the entire school system demands that ‘‘each successive stage

of development shall not exclude its predecessor, but shall
transform and ennoble it.’’

Our kindergartners are all interested and are wholeheartedly assisting in strengthening this branch of education. Among them are many who possess the qualities that
make for successful leaders in the work, the spirit of nurture
or mothering, systematic understanding of how little
child feels and thinks, and an insight into the significance of
erude beginnings. |

Our objective is to prepare outlines of methods, projects
and rhythmic games, to determine periods of attendance,
and to arrange for the full time of the teachers.

SPECIAL CLASSES. .

In every good school system special classes should be organized to assist particular groups who will not receive the
right training in the regular grades or would hinder the
regular class groups.

The atypical class housed in the Elm Street School has. .
been most successful. Here children from different parts 
of the city meet and receive special training to meet their
particular needs. The hours of attendance are from nine .
o’clock in the morning to two o'clock in the afternoon.

The course of study includes physical and manual training, and many of the school activities have for their object
the development of the senses of touch, sight and hearing.
The manual work includes basketry, sewing, chair-caning,
and brush-making.

Reading, writing, spelling, number, drawing, singing
and special training in English, through story-telling and
dramatization, comprise the academic work.

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS |

The teacher of this class has been very successful in her
efforts to establish sympathetic relations between the school
and the home from which these children come. Therefore, the
parents co-operate in her plans for the physical and intellectual improvement of their children.

We-need accommodation for at least one more class of
this type, as we have group of eighteen children who need

| this special training.

There is also need of accommodation for two or three
classes for over-age non-English speaking pupils who need
special teaching in English to fit them for the regular grades.

JUNIOR RED CROSS.

In war-time the pupils in the schools enjoyed many edu- |
cative experiences which the usual round of studies does not
provide. The various activities engaged in taught them the

. true meaning of service.

The Junior Red Cross in our schools is most successful
organization from many viewpoints, and the results achieved
were remarkable and have been reported several times. The
generous praise we received for the work accomplished by our
pupils, in the past two vears, has been most gratifying.

The underlying principle of the Junior Red Cross is a
far-reaching one—the training of Young America in habits,
ideals, and attitudes of service. Its purpose is patriotic as
well as humanitarian, The goal of the Junior Red Cross is,

‘That live interest in behalf of all children may be

aroused; that, in their school days they may come to be

moved by spirit of helpfulness and interdependence; all in

the hope that men and women of tomorrow may ever think in

terms of service to others and that we may all enjoy big- .
cer, better, broader ecitizenship.’’ We must all realize that

the sole hope of any nation is with the children.

Every pupil from kindergarten to high school inclusive
is member.

: REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
Besides sewing, knitting and toymaking when needed, a
new project will be undertaken this year—Interschool Correspondence. This work is being carefully planned and wil
be systematically assigned. The project cannot help but develop form of edueational service which will be of dirsct
benefit to educators in America and other countries by providing contacts between the teachers for thé exchange oi alucational material and ideas.

, Sympathy will be broadened and prejudice dispelled.
Pupils will learn to think of nations and of our relations to
other nations.

The assigning of this privilege to the cities of Massachusetts is in the hands of Dr. Payson Smith of the State Board
of Education. He has given the privilege to Holyoke, and
it will be placed before the pupils of the High School English Department at once. We await results with interest.

November we had  in the treasury. We
paid out  for fifty-seven subscriptions for Junior Red
Cross News to be distributed among the different schools. We
have on hand, January six dollars and eighty-one
cents.

AMERICANIZATION.

This great movement should be considered community
project under centralized authority but with state supervision.

The Holyoke plan of Americanization work met with the
approval of the state authorities as well as of other leaders
in the work in the State. Frequent inquiries concerning our
plan, clesses and results have been received from. cities
throughout New England.

The School Board is the central authority, the Director
represents the School Board in supervising the work.

Last vear classes were conducted in both the evening elementary and high schools. Twenty-two classes were organized in the various industries. Three special and three neigh- .

‘

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

borhood classes met with much success. During the month

of July two classes, consisting of forty men, were instructed

in eltizenship at the Lawrenee School. There was total of )
thirty-six classes and an enrolment of four hundred thirtyeight.

This year opened with prospects of great work in different directions. In October Miss Nellie Perry, who was the
full-time teacher during the vear, resigned to accept position in Quincy. Mass. Miss Anna Warren was appointed to
fill this vaecaney. ,

The industrial depression has interfered, In measure,
with the reeruiting of new classes. This interesting fact,
however, should be reported—both men and women have attended the English classes on days when the factories were
closed. ,

We have organized forty classes, as follows:

  classes in Citizenship at Evening High School.

  classes in Citizenship in school buildinygs.
  classes in: various industries.

  classes in Evening Elementary Schools.

  Neighborhood classes in school buildings.

  Special Classes in school buildings. ,

The total enrolment is  .

We feel that the work is well established here and look
forward to greater results. We believe that there are five
things necessary to make effective the great Americanization
movement; they are the vital interest and support of the
pubhie, authoritative leadership, intelligent co-ordination or
working agencies under public direction, more irained
teachers, and adequate publie funds.

CONCLUSION, .

In conclusion wish to report that the amount. of
ground eovered and the high standard of the work obtained
in the primary grades this fall is exceptionally good. There

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
are several reasons for this, not the least of which is the
regular attendance of the pupils this term. The good
weather, the freedom from serious epidemics and plenty of
coal have made it possible for all our little folks to attend
school regularly.

I acknowledge the hearty co-operation of principals and
teachers at all times. take this opportunity of thanking
you for your courtesy and kindness, as well as for the advice
and help given me in the various phases of my work.

PART IV.
REPORT OF PRINCIPAL OF THE
HIGH SCHOOL.
To the Superintendent of Schools:
There has never been time in the history of our nation
where education counts for more than it does today. This
new education must emphasize the social and industrial life
of the future citizen. It is in the high school where these
phases of education should be fostered in every way. It  s
said that boy or girl with high school education has eightyseven times the chance of rendering distinguished service
over the boy or girl without high school training. Every
effort should be made to give all of our boys and girls high
schoo] education or its equivalent. The form of the work in
the high school and the methods of teaching can be changed
to tie up the high school work with the duties and responsibilities of citizenship without impairing the content of the
subject matter.

More is being done this year than ever before in many
of the classrooms to place the responsibility of the preparation of the lesson and the classroom recitation on the pupils
themselves. This, when intelligently directed and supervised,
awakens in the pupil greater interest in the subject and a
development. of individual responsibility. In the English

Department this phase of classroom work finds its most appropriate field. Topical recitations, project work, investigation of original sources and group forums are made part of

the classroom period. It has been found possible to carry on

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
active recitations with very little direct help from the
teacher. Such work, however, can only be successful where
both pupils and teachers have made proper preparation.
Efforts similar to this are carried on in many of the depart
ments, such as the History, Language and Science classes.
It is the kind of work that will grow and give to both pupils
and teachers larger vision. We must think more of the
boy or girl and less of the subject matter, more of mental
and moral development and less of the percentage in ex- —
aminations.

In some of our departments it is possible to come into very close contact with the community. This is particularly
true of the Commercial Department. More was done in the
last year than ever before in sending our boys and girls into
offices as part of their high school work. In our graduating
class there were ten pupils who were excused before the close
of the year for full-time work and six for part-time. To
receive credit the firm employing the pupils was obliged to
give satisfactory report to the high school. All of these
returns were extremely gratifying, the pupils continuing in
most eases in their positions after their graduation. Some
of the firms co-operating with the high school were: The
National Blank Book Company, The Affleck Ruling and
Stationery Company, Besse-Mills Company, The Fisk Rubber
Company, The American Writing Paper Company, Potter
Knitting Company of Springfield, Holyoke National Bank,
National Fruit and Produce Company. Many other pupils
were working outside of school hours along the lines of their
courses but it would be difficult to furnish the exact record
of such employment.

The success of our pupils in the College Board Examinations in June is evidence of the ability of this school to give
satisfactory preparation for college work. The record of
Miss Rose Fitzgerald of the class of is one that reflects
great credit upon the young lady and to some extent on the
school that prepared her for college. As result of the Com  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
- prehensive College Board Examinations taken by large
number of the entering class of Smith Miss Fitzgerald was
awarded prize of  for submitting the best set of exam
ination answer papers. This competition comes from both
public and private schools in many parts of this country.
The records received from the colleges during the year show,
with hardly an exception, satisfactory college work of Holvoke Iligh School graduates.
In the class of  which numbered  the Alumni
Prize given in the Classical Department was awarded to
Miss Rose Fitzgerald, and in the Science Department to
Richard Lassister.
Members of this class are represented in the following

present expect to do so sometime in the near future. It is
eertain that over of the class will continue their edueation in advanced institutions of learning.

The High School does not show great loss by the withdrawals of pupils. One of the reasons is that the number of
pupils in classes is not excessive. Our reeords show the following in regard to the size of classes. From pupils—

are found in the History, English or Household Arts Courses.
Besides the methods of teaching previously mentioned
other means are taken to keep our pupils in school. One is
the daily communication with the home in eases of absences.
Another is the frequent reports sent to the homes and still
another is the time taken by the teachers to give individual
assistance to pupils who need it. Our reeords show. that
since the opening of school up to December  the time of
the writme of this report, thirty pupils withdrew. The
reasons given were as follows: To go to work— Entered
other schools— TIness— Advised to withdraw— Poor
work— Moved out of town— Entered army— Postpraduate who withdrew to enter business school— Kntered Voeational Sehool— Reasons not given—l. This
record, IT helieve, shows the effort on the part of the high
school authorities to maintain the maximum pupil membership and every effort will be continued to keep in school
pupils who are able and willing to receive the advantages
afforded here.

The organizations inside the school that take the form of
clubs or associations are as follows: The Athletie Association which holds four meetings vear and has membership
of  The Phi Alpha which holds ten meetings year and

 The French Club holds five meetings year and has a
membership of  Boys and girls who have had at least one
year of French are entitled to membership. The Musieal
Club holds fifteen meétings year with membership of  .
There is no restriction to the membership in this club. These
organizations are supervised by teachers.
The arrangements for the earrying out of the programs
for the meetings are in the hands of the pupils themselves.
These societies are democratic in their membership, and
occupy place in the school of almost as much importance as
the classes in regular school work. They funetion im the
development of the pupils by bringimg them into social relations with their fellows and on the literary side they encourage voluntary effort in debate, public speaking, reading,
writing themes and story-telling. Many of the clubs undertake projects of social service. The most important for the
year was the pledging and successfully seeuring of
the sum of  for Holvoke’s Village in Franee. The
French Club, through series of motion picture entertain- 
ments, the ‘‘Q’’ Club by small weekly individual assess- )
ment and the other clubs either by entertainments or through
individual subseription were able to give to Miss Belle Skinner on her return from France in October purse of .
This presentation was made before the school and invited
guests by representatives of the ‘‘Q’’ Club and French Club.

the direction of the English department but all of the departments Joined in the effort to make the occasion success.
Many original posters, poems, and themes were posted
throughout the building all in the interests of better sph.
At the beginning of the week two speakers representing busi- hess mstitutions spoke to the sehool. On the last day of the
week several original plays were given. These plays were
the product of our own pupils. The benefits of this week
eannot be estimated, but it is certain that the manner and
method with which the idea was carried out will create
lasting impressions upon all of the pupils and greater care
in the use of English is sure to be result.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

In my report of last year referred to the establishing
of the Junior College and an optional four year High School
course. Now that the Junior High School is in permanent
form so that in the future we will have but three classes in ,
this building, would again emphasize the recommendations
of last year. trust that the Board will take some action
soon in investigating the advisability of carrying out these
recommendations. .

The physical equipment of the high school is good eon, sidering the building was erected years ago. Everything
considered it is in good state of repair, but some changes
should be made. One is the installation of iron stairways
with stone treads in place of the original wooden stairways.
I would also suggest that an entrance to the building be
made on the Bh Street side similar to the entrances on the
other three sides of the building. Many of the classrooms
need redecorating, in fact do not believe it is asking too

, much that this coming summer the building be overhauled as
far as the walls and woodwork are concerned.

The action of the School Board in increasing the salaries
of the teachers has awakened new interest on the part of
our teachers in their profession. Not many of our teachers
are working with the dollar sign in sight but an appreciation
of their efforts  certain to result in better teaching and a
better student product. satisfied teacher is more willing
and efficient worker and would in behalf of the teachers
in the school express our appreciation to the School Board
for its generous action.

e
REPORTS OF SUPERVISORS.

This part of the volume is devoted exclusively to
excerpts from the statements submitted annually in December, to the Superintendent by the supervisors of special departments. In addition to these are extracts from the reports
of the Principal of the Evening High School, of the Supervisor of Home and School Garden Work, and the Schoolhouse
Agent. As special feature, Mr. Appel has made complete
report on the swimming pool.

Mr. Robert E. Hamill, Supervisor of Industrial Arts,

, has made the following report:

“Progress in the development of manual training has been’ somewhat retarded during the past vear because of the lack of funds, but
we may now look forward to the addition of equipment and materials

: which will make our department fully developed one in the Junior

High Schools. The primary requirement at this time is revisal of our

program or the adoption of new one.. It is necessary that we have an

additional teacher or at least the services of teacher for part of

. each week. We are working on plan of shop work development that
will accomplish the change from the old style grammar school manual |

training to the newer Junior High shop practice. During such change

it is essential that the supervision of the course of study, the work of

teachers, and the purchase of supplies and material be adequate to

make the work efficient and economical.

“In the high school shops several important changes should be
made, and space for the storage of pupils’ work should be provided.
Indeed, since classes in Continuation School shop practice are conducted in the same room, this is important. The benches and vices,
having scen continuous service for over twenty years. now need attention. It should be possible to re-top the benches, and replace the vices
at moderate cost. It is also imperative that certain definite time be

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
assigned for the care of the expensive wood-working machinery and
foundry equipment in the high school shops. ‘The only arrangement
now possible is one in which the instructor takes time from classes to
do such work as repairing belts, oiling and cleaning machinery, ete. It
would be matter of real economy to have such important work properly done.

“One of the problems we hope to solve this year is the question of
equipment for teaching mechanical drawing at least to all practical arts
pupils in the junior high schools. This is practical and teachable
subject, requiring minimum outlay for material and for which much
of the standard equipment may be built in our school shops.

“Among the things of general interest accomplished during the past
year was an exhibit of about two hundred toys placed in Horticultural
Hall in Boston for the American Red Cross Exhibit. These toys were
classed as Junior Red Cross work, and were the subject of highly favorable comment.”

The Supervisor of the Household Arts Department,
Miss Teresa L. Dowd, submitted the following statement:

“Work in the classes in sewing of both the Senior High and Junior
High has been most satisfactory. The three first-year classes in High
School have completed, since September, two hundred and twenty-five
undergraments and are now ready to make dresses. The two secondyear and one third-year classes have completed fifty dresses or work
equal to them. These include garments made of serge, silk, satin and 
cotton material. Fifteen of the senior class made their Class Day, and
two their graduation dresses last year. These were exhibited during
the month of June, as were also the hats made in the millinery classes.
Mr. Conant gave three prizes to members of this class for excellence in

. work.

“In the Junior High School the work has advanced great deal.
The work in the first year being elementary, and growing more advanced until the last year, many pupils are able to make dresses for
themselves not alone in school but at home. The work by Miss Fenton
at the Joseph Metcalf School deserves special mention.

“The work at the Morgan School  greatly handicapped because
of proper serwing room space, lack of equipment, and difhculty in getting the children to bring material to work on. certain sum of
money should be appropriated by the School Board to buy material,
then the finished garments could be distributed among the poor children who are often compelled to remain away from school because of
lack of clothing.

 

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

“The sewing and cooking at the Lawrence School has been very
satisfactory. The work in cooking should be carried through the |
school year in order to get the best results.

- “We hope that by the next school year all our Junior High Schools
will be properly equipped for sewing and cooking, so that each teacher
may be able to do the same amount of work and the work in the different schools be kept on the same basis.

“The number of pupils in sewing classes in the High School
should be limited to twenty-four, and double periods twice week
should be established. Millinery should be added to the course of
study at the High School, and teacher appointed for the work.”

Mrs. Ferry, the Supervisor of Drawing, deplores the
little time which is given to this subject in the Junior High
School. It is probable that before another year, ‘the time
schedule will be so changed as to add an extra period for
this work.

 

“The work in my department, from Grade to Grade VI inclusive,
is generally satisfactory, both as regards Manual Training and Drawing, which are both under my direction in these grades.

“The work is made interesting to the children, and they, in turn,
are interested in it and as much is accomplished as can reasonably be
expected in these grades. valuable foundation is laid here for future
teaching in the upper grades, but the future teaching fails to materialize
in the Junior High Schools, where we ought to be able to secure our
most attractive results. know of no other place where so little time
is given to the subject of drawing in the upper grades, as is the case
here in Holyoke, and the effect of this neglect in the Junior High —
Schools is very noticeable in the pupils who enter the High School.
They are not prepared to do at all the same grade of work as in former
years, but even this lack of training is not the worst feature of the
case, the fact is, they have lost all interest in the subject because they
see so little result of their work. It is most discouraging to pupils as
well as to supervisors.

“IT had hoped that making drawing an elective subject in Junior
High IJ] would be help, and it would be if it had the co-operation
of the principals and the amount of time that is allotted to the subject
in Springfield, for instance. Pupils in Junior High III, who elect drawing in Springfield, have four periods week, two double periods. Naturally, those who elect it are pupils who have some ability, and given
pupils of ability and four periods week, excellent results are assured.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
Conditions have been entirely different here, however. Pupils in Junior
High and II have had only one period week instead of two, and in
Junior High III the time has not been lengthened on account of its being made an elective study, so matters are rather worse than better.

“TI fear that you will think this very pessimistic report, in fact it
is the most discouraging one have ever made during my long term of
service here, but we have had the reputation of doing excellent work
in my department for many years—work that has received high commendation from the state authorities. and it seems to me real tragedy
to have our work deteriorate to such an extent, from circumstances entirely beyond my control. hope that the present condition of affairs
here may prove to be confirmation of the old saying, ‘It is always
darkest just before dawn.’ ”

| The following brief excerpt is taken from the report of
Miss Esther A. MaeDonnell, Supervisor of Writing:

“The department of writing during the past year has been carried
along the same lines as the preceding one, the Palmer Method being
used. To cach grade is designated certain number of drills to perfect. This work comprises the entire book. the work of each pupil
being kept on file and ts open to inspection at all times. What we have
striven mostly for has been to make this drill work and form study
serve aS means to an end, that is free legible body writing, such as
language, compositions, etc., and improvement has been made along
these lines. It also has given me pleasure to note an improvement in
the presentation of teachers’ board work to the pupils. This is very
important, especially in the lower grades, where imitation plays so
large part. would ask that better quality of paper be supplied ;
both for specific and general written work.”

Mr. Hugh Craig, Supervisor of Musie, also complains
that his work is being slighted in the Junior High School.
He has the following report to make, in part:

“The primary schools have gone along as in previous years, and are
maintaining high standard. Weare still using sight-singing exercises
as an aid in helping the children to be more ready and eager to sing
their songs at first sight, and they are doing very well.

“The time schedule for the primary grades allows one hour week
for singing. This is divided into three periods, giving them minutes’
practice three days during the week, which works very well. When we
reach the Junior High School our troubles commence, as we are al  REPORT. OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

lowed only one period of minutes each week. When you think of |
teaching rudiments of music. two, three and four-part singing under
such conditions, find it very discouraging. Just think of child taking private music lesson once week, and during the rest of the
week no practicing was done. am sure you will agree with me that
it would be very unsatisfactory. Therefore, would ask that might
have two periods weekly; that is what other cities are giving. We are
now about to put new music system in our schools, but no real progress can be made until the time problem is solved. In all my enquiries
I have failed to find city giving so little time to music in the Junior
High as we do. It would please me very much if you would give this
your serious consideration.

“We have an orchestra in each Junior High School, and they are
doing very satisfactory work. At the High School we had two choruses, about voices in both, and for feature we sang last April, a
cantata, “The Rose Maiden,” by Cowan, assisted by New York soloists.
A great deal of pleasure is afforded the school by the Bovs’ Glee Club
and the orchestra, in their singing and plaving at the Wednesday exercises. The singing of the seniors at graduation has never been exa celled in our schools.” |
The Evening High School is one of the most important
units in our school organization. Principal P. J. Garvey of
the Evening Ifigh School has this to report:

“The commercial department has held its own fairly well, the
standard of pupils, particularly in the typewriting classes, is excellent.
Many young women, as well as few married ladies engaged in various
lines of clerical work, enrolled this year, in addition to the usual number who are employed in the mills. class in office appliance work was
opened this year for the first time, and Nas done very good work.
Next year this class ought to prove very popular.

“The best classes in regular High School work this year are mechanical drawing and mathematics. The enrolment of in the mechanical drawing class is high, and the per cent of attendance is well
above the average of the school. The boys are doing fine work and
receiving much practical benefit from the instruction given. There is
inimediate need of sets of instruments and few more text books. A
cabinet with individual drawers should be provided for this class in
the near future, for under present conditions the pupils are working
under handicap. The mathematics class is made up of pupils for

the most part who are taking college preparatory work, and the course,
as arranged by Miss Barry of the High School faculty, has proved very
attractive. ,

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

“Classes in general cooking which were opened last year and
proved so popular, have grown to such proportions as it was impossible to provide for more than one-third of those who enrolled. When
the class opened in October last, sought admission, and we could
accommodate only  Since then many others have applied for ad- .
niission, and it has proved great problem to handle the situation.
Naturally, many were disappointed. We selected first the recently
married and about to be married ladies, young women who had little
or no experience in cooking and home management. and we have undoubtedly helped to preserve peace and happiness in manv homes by
providing young brides as well as prospective brides with instruction in
one of the great essentials of home management. Incidentally, feel
that this class has contributed in some degree at least to the continued
happiness of their wedded life. There is strong demand for instruction in general cooking, and we ought to be able to supply it. It was
a keen disappointment to me to be obliged to refuse admission to more
than women during the past term. Another room could be fitted up 
and supplies furnished with little expense. If this were done we could
take care of about more pupils, by conducting four classes, meeting
twice weck, instead of two classes, as at present.

“During the present term two classes in special subjects were
cpened—basketry and china painting. The basketry class was discontinued shortly after opening because the teacher found it impossible to
do satisfactory work with the large number in attendance, and she gave
up the work. The school department did not deem the work of suthcient practical value to warrant its continuance, and no other teacher
being available, the class was closed. The china painting class is conducted under special arrangement, whereby about one-half the teacher’s salary and the cost of all supplies are paid for by those attending.
This class has proved very popular, but on account of the nature of the
work it ought not to exd ten or twelve members.

“Classes in naturalization and citizenship continue to be well patronized. At the present time there are four classes in this subject,
which includes also instruction in English for foreigners. pleasing
feature of this work is the increasing number of women in attendance.
The work is conducted along the line of previous years and covers the .
whole field of American government, national, state, county and municipal. This particular phase of Evening High School work has become well known throughout ‘the state, and has received much favor* able comment from federal officials. pleasing feature of the graduation exercises of the school last year was the awarding of diplomas
by the Department of Labor to about members of this class, and
Congressman Treadway deemed the occasion of sufficient importance

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC. SCHOOLS .

to come from Washington and deliver the graduation address. The
classes are well equipped with text books, pamphlets, etc., most of
which were furnished by the federal government.

“It is time that the Board of Public Works awoke to the necessity of installing proper lighting system in the High School building.

When this building was erected twenty years ago, no provision what-  .
ever was made for Evening School work. and with the exception of a
rearrangement of lights in few rooms, the hghting system remains
the same as it was originally installed. The result is that pupils at
night labor under considerable strain upon their eyes, and many of
them are compelled to abandon their work entirely because of injury
to their eyesight. The whole system ts antiquated, the corridors are
dingy, six coat rooms have no outlets whatever for lights, the fixtures
in nearly all the rooms are high up close to the ceiling with some of
the reflectors broken, and the general appearance of some rooms spells
. neglect. It is very hard for pupil to gather inspiration and develop
worthy ambitions for the better things of life when forced to study
in room hike number  It would seem that the members of the
board having this matter in charge would have pride enough in such a
splendid building as that of the High School to at least keep it clean
and in good repair. The standard of any school depends materially
upon the personnel of its teaching force, and we cannot retain teachers
unless they receive adequate compensation. The Evening High School
teachers are underpaid at present, and unless some provision is made
to remedy this condition we shall lose some of them next year.”

The Home and School Garden work this year was ear- |
ried on as distinctly school project, with emphasis on the |
educational rather than the productive side of the work.

Just previous to his resignation, Mr. George D. Hearn, who
has been in charge of this work ever since its inauguration,
submitted this final report:

“The Department of Home and School Gardens has again closed a
profitable year, as the following statistics indicate:

“During the summer the Massachusetts Agricultural College held
a pleasure-profit field day for the club workers of Hampden County..
Holyoke sent enthusiastic canners and gardeners, by far the largest
delegation present. The trip was made in autos and trucks loaned by
public-spirited Holyokers. ,

“A group of canners went on picnic to South Hadlev at another
time in truck loaned by one interested in the work.

“At the annual exhibition held at High street, there were  
separate exhibits. Approximately people visited the exhibition,
and there were many expressions of appreciation. All displays were
judged, and the best received prize cards. Through the Rotary Club,
cash prizes were given for the very best displays.

“Through the material co-operation of the Holyoke Rotary Club,
again, the Holyoke School department was well advertised at the Eastern States Exposition by large garden and canning booth, which was
maintained through the entire weck. In arranging the booth, the garden supervisor was ably assisted by the Manual Training supervisor.
Needless to say, it called for considerable expenditure of time anil
energy on the part of both.

“A prize of  was given by the Chamber of Commerce for the
best garden in the city;  by the School-Department for the second
best garden, and boxes of fine stationery by the White Wyckoff
Company for the next best gardens. One hundred more gardens were
awarded Honorable Mention.

“Especial notice should be taken of the fact that one High School
girl made over  from her flower garden, which was the best in
the city. The money is being saved toward an education.

“A distinct advance was made this year when each school gardener
was required to make deposit of  for his garden. This not only
served to make the boy or girl more interested, but it also provided a
small fund for the improvement of the soil. ,

“Next year, because of the stealing from the gardens, and the poor, ness of the soil in the Northampton street gardens, the supervisor feels
that it would be better to concentrate on one large school garden in
Springdale.

“It would also be big step forward if all the parochial schools
could be brought into the canning and gardening movement. The St.
Jerome School made an exceptionally fine canning record this past
season.

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

“The supervisor feels that additional appropriation should be made
in for more assistants, there being only one in gardening this season; and for photographic work, especially set of local slides.

“The present canning supervisor has made good beginning, and it
would be an advantage if she could be secured, at an early date, for
next season, so that plans could be made accordingly.

“The aim of the Home and School Garden Movement is, not to
make farmers, but to produce citizens who know how to make the environs of their homes both attractive and profitable. The success of the
first aim is attested by the appearance of the homes, and the latter by
the fact that the produce raised by the school children may be conservatively estimated at seven thousand four hundred dollars.” "

Mr. Cadieux, the Schoolhouse Agent, submitted the following recommendations, most of which concern the Board
of Public Works.

“The work in general has gone along very satisfactorily, and the
janitors, for the most part, have given efficient service.

; “It  with regret that am compelled to report the accident which
occurred early in the year in the swimming pool, which resulted in the

| death of Mr. Michael Fahey, one of our most faithful and efficient
’ workers. His death by accidental drowning was real loss to the department, and he is missed by all those with whom he came in contact.

“It was found necessary to rearrange some of the furniture in several of the buildings, and in so doing, desks and chairs were removed and reset in cach of the following buildings: West Street,
Springdale, Morgan, Park Street, Hamilton Street and the High
School. These, together with the desks and chairs which we provided
for the Continuation School, totalled about  .

“In order to furnish the Continuation School sewing department,
we gathered such odd tables and chairs as we could find in the several
buildings, repaired them, and put them into use, thus saving considerable sum of money for the Department. In the Hivh School alone,
over chairs and tables were repaired by Mr. Brown and  his
assistant.

rooms, new pipe and valve for soda ash in boilers. Four new closets

inside and out.
Following the opening of school in September, Dr.
Harold E. Miner resigned his position as Medical Director.
Dr. Miner was capable and efficient public servant, unusually su ssful in public school work. His loss is mitigated
- only by the fact that he has entered broader field of
 public service.
Dr. Wilfred M. St. Georges, who was promoted to Dr.
Miner's position, submitted summary of the work performed during the year. Among other facts, he points out
that all the children in the elementary schools were weighed
and measured during the year, and the results carefully
tabulated and placed on file. Children were inspected also .
for enlarged tonsils and deeayed teeth. About children
were examined for working certificates; while upwards of |
one thousand children were vaccinated. Dr. St. Georges
earnestly recommends dental clinie and the addition of
another nurse, stating that there should be nurse to every
four elementary schools.
Supplementing this report are the reports of Dr.
Honoria Shine, who assists Dr. St. Georges, and of Miss Bess |
KE. Sullivan, senior school nurse, as follows:
Report of Dr. Shine:
“During the year my work in the High Schools was as follows:
“ Complete physical examination of all the girls in the public
and parochial high schools.
“ Special prescriptions of corrective exercises for acquired and |
structural defects resulting in faulty posture. |
“ Weekly medical inspection of gymnasium classes.
“ Follow-up work with cases of malnutrition, faulty posture, |
skin diseases, eye, ear, nose, throat and teeth defects. |
“ Treatment of all other cases referred by the Dean and physical |
training instructors.
. |

:

REFORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

“As result of the physical examinations, seven girls had operations for the removal of diseased tonsils, three for chronic appendicitis,
and fourteen received treatment for poor eye conditions. It was encouraging to note the large number of pupils who received dental care,
although there is still much work to be done in that regard.

“In general the health of the High School girls during was
especially good. This is due. to great extent. to the co-operation of
the parents and also to the attitude of the girls themselves, who are beginning to realize the important role that sane living plays in building

- the foundation for future good health.”

Report of Miss Sullivan, School .Nurse.

“The duties of the School Nurse in Holyoke are composition of
both nursing and social welfare work—assisting the Medical Inspectors
in combating contagious disease—assisting with vaccination, and in the
physical examination of all school children.

“We have already started in some of our schools the monthly
weighing system of the children, hoping thereby to locate all true cases
of malnourishment. ,
uring the past year summary of all children was made, results already given in the report of the Medical Inspector. We also
have had sixteen children operated upon for the removal of adenoids and tonsils. Through the generosity of the local eye and ear specialists, we have had nearly fifty children examined and fitted for glasses.
This does not include children cared for by their respective families.

“Schools are visited weekly, and in the congested districts have
taken on the form of clinic, for example; one month’s record of one
school is as follows:

enough to care for themselves, home visits are unnecessary.

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
“We have found the baths at the William Whiting School most
valuable for children in other districts, and we strongly recommend installation of baths in other parts of the city.
“Our department has been especially fortunate in the appointment
of Miss Ella Cleary, as School Nurse, thereby increasing our efficiency.
“T wish to acknowledge my appreciation of the hearty co-operation
of Miss Mary McMahon, The Needlework Guild, The St. Agnes Guild,
eye and ear specialists, Board of Health, and the, Relief Department.
who have rendered assistance in many cases of neglect which have
come to my attention.”
Mr. Louis K. Appel in his capacity as Supervisor of
Iveiene and Director of Physieal Edueation in the grades,
submitted the following interesting account of the vear’s
activities:
(A) PITYSICAL EDUCATION, |
Primary Grades.
“The work in Physical Education of the primary grades has been
conducted along the same line as in preceding years. In September,
Miss Mary McCormick was appointed to sucd Miss Ruth Yoerg,
who became swimming teacher at the Hish School. For her work,
which deals with the first four grades and the kindergarten, she is admirably fitted. since she has an unusually sympathetic interest in little
children.
“Miss Mary V. Cronin devotes two and one-half davs weekly to
the fifth and sixth grades. Under her direction the children acquire
that precision of execution which cannot be obtained from the younger
children. Folk dancing, which has proved so popular, has had to be
curtailed in these grades, for the afternoon sessions of the kindergartens have taken away the only available space where this activity can
be practiced. !
“The time allotment in the primary grades is satisfactory, for |
minutes daily is allowed for calisthenics, plays and games. |
\ |
Junior Tigh Schools.
“The work in the Junior High Schools is conducted by the Director. The course of study which has been worked out in previous vears,
supplies abundant material in calisthenics, marching, folk-dances and
indoor and outdoor games. !
“Under existing conditions no more can be attempted.  !
“Since Junior III corresponds to the Freshman year at the High :
School, the need for gymnasia has become more imperative. ;

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

“Time allotment: Two periods weekly are devoted to physical
education and hygiene. scheme which has met with favor is the division of  -minute period into halves: minutes being devoted to
physical education, and minutes to the instruction of hygiene.

“There is no uniformity among the various Junior High Schools
in regard to physical exercise outside of the alloted two periods, owing
to the fact that conditions in the different buildings vary. It is advisable, and perhaps the new program for Jumior High Schools will
find it feasible, to have more frequent short periods of exercise and
play daily. ‘The benefits of exercise are apparent only when small
amounts are taken frequently rather than long periods bi-weekly.
Athletics.

“Baseball and soccer leagues were organized as heretofore. Fach
team played four games on its own grounds and four games on the
visitor’s grounds. This method has led to the strengthening of school
spirit, which is so desirable.

“All games are referred or umpired by Mr. Thomas Finn, whose

. influence has led to the disappearance of that petty wrangling that was
so prevalent among the boys years ago. With the co-operation of the
principals, the boys have learned to recognize the principle that it is
more honorable to play ‘fair,’ irrespective of whether one wins or loses,
than it is to ‘win at any cost.’

“With this lesson learned, the boys will contribute their share
teward the betterment of sport in general. The leagues finished as
follows:

“Baseball: Morgan, Metcalf, Highland, Lawrence and West.

“Soccer: Metcalf, Morgan, Highland, Lawrence and West.
ainnual Field Day. ,

“The Sixth Annual Field Day was held at the Hampden and the
Prospect playgrounds on June Competition among the  
entrants and among the grammar schools was keen. The Metcalf
School won both the boys’ and the girls’ meets, as well as both relays.
The Elm Street School won both the relay races for primary school
boys and girls. .

“Until an enclosed athletic field is attainable where non-participants can be kept off the ficld, success of the enterprise will vary inversely with the inconvenience occasioned by spectators crowding the
contestants.

“Thanks are due to all the many individuals who helped to make
the event success. :

Efficiency Tests.
“The efficiency tests: Dash, standing broad jump. and chinning for |
the boys; and dash, standing broad jump and knee-raising for the girls, .
will always remain the most effective method of reaching the entire
body of children. The results of this test are herewith given:
“Grammar School Boys: Highland,  Metcalf,  Lawrence,  Morgan,  and West,  .
“Grammar School Girls: Lawrence, Highland, Metcalf, Morgan,  and West,  .

“Silver trophies, to be retained one year, were awarded to the win- —
ners. The South Chestnut Street School retains permanent possession
of the Primary School cup, having won it three times and the Springdale School having won it twice.
(B) EXTENSION WORK IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION.
Saturday Morning Classes.
“Saturday morning classes at the High School gymnasium and pool
for boys and girls of Junior JEI are as popular as ever. large per{  .
centage of the pupils avail themselves of the opportunity to pfocure
that phase of physical education that needs must be neglected during
the week on account of the lack of facilities.
“An innovation, swimming meet at the end of the year, was instrumental in increasing both the attendance and the interest in swimming. ‘The. Lawrence School won the boys’ meet, and the Metcalf
School the girls’ meet.
Evening Classes.
“Classes in Physical Education for Evening High School and
: Evening Vocational School boys and girls were organized. class of
  women were given instruction in the gymnasium and in the pool
by Miss Septa Lynn. Two classes of men, averaging to in each
class, were instructed in the gymnasium for the first term by Mr. Dawson, and for the second term by Mr. Davenport. Mr. Francoeur had
charge of them in the pool.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
Continuation School Classes. |

“On account of both the success and the necessity of physical education for the evening schools, similar scheme was put in operation
for the Continuation School boys. Gymnasium classes are in charge of
Mr. Appel, and swimming classes are instructed by Mr. Francoeur.

-“Tt is hoped that this scheme will be extended to include also the
girls. Extension work in Physical Education is not an experiment, for
leading educators recognize the values that come from systematic and
properly supervised physical activities: health,-mental development and
character building.

(C) HYGIENE.
High School.

“Weekly lectures, recitations and demonstrations have been given
by the Director to the Freshman classes at the High School. Pupils
are required to pass an examination which entitles them to one-half .
credit.

“At its best, such short course can cover only limited field.
The important underlying principles of health can be sufficiently emphasized, however, to interest the pupils in their bodily needs,

Junior High Schools and Grades.

“Instruction in Hygiene in the Junior High Schools has been conducted by the section teacher, who follows course of study embracing
the best of several text-books. In similar manner, the subject is
taught by the primary teachers.

“While the advantage of departmental work in some branches is
apparent, it  advisable to have the regular classroom teacher impress
upon the pupils the many habits which have bearing upon health.
Inasmuch as evcry teacher is responsible not only for the teaching of
the subject, but also for the putting into practice of the health habits,
the practical knowledge gained is consequently greater than by the departmental method of teaching, since each teacher is brought face to
face with the practical operation of health habits.”

In addition to his regular school duties, Mr. Appel has
been assigned the direction of the rental of the High School
Gymnasium and Swimming Pool by publie classes. Both of
these are in constant demand, The use of the gymnasium  s
given without charge, but fixed sum is assessed for the use
of the swimming pool. The receipts of the swimming pool

are placed in fund, outside of the regular school appropriation; and are used to pay instructors’ salaries, to
purchase new equipment for the pool, and to improve con- ,
ditions generally. Mr. Appel reports periodically to the
Superintendent on the finances of the swimming pool. These
reports ever since the beginning are on file and open to
public inspection.

His statements on both the Gymnasium and Swimming
Pool are printed in full. ,

PUBLIC USE OF HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM.

. ‘‘The fiseal year ending December has been the
most suecessful, so far as the number of people using the
gymnasium is concerned, since the construction of the gymnasium.

It has been the policy of the School Board to grant
permission to parties other than the High School to use the
gymnasium for physical activities. Following is list of the

have been submitted annually and  bi-annually to the
Superintendent and the Sehool Board, but they have never

Respectfully submitted,
LOUIS K. APPEL,
Director. ,
Improvements made in the last year.
 On account of the larger classes of Tigh School girls at
the pool, two new hair-dryers have been installed during the
current year, which has added to the convenience of both
the High School and the publie classes. ,
During the month of November the three  -inch .
pressure filters were overhauled, new gravel and sand being
installed. deeided change in the appearance and clean- ,
liness of the water has resulted. for the filters had not been
overhauled since the construction of the pool four years ago.
sO An: automatic oil dripping attachment and blow out
fuse have been attached to the pump, which permits the
: water to be ecirenlated constantly through the filters. Heretofore the pump was closed down when the night janitor left
the building. Now the pump runs constantly. It is during
the night that the filters clear up the water more efficiently
than at any other time. since there are no bathers using the
pool.
Recommendations. |
There is urgent need of obtaining vacuum cleaner
to remove the sediment that collects at the bottom of the
pool. At the present time this sediment is brushed to the
strainer and is then sent through the filters. This operation
stirs up the sediment and spreads it throughout the pool,
and also puts an unnecessary strain on the filters, hecause
the dirt is sueked in from the strainer directly into them.
It is hoped that sanitary dust removing cleaner and
- necessary pump can be obtained in the near future.

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ;

As matter of safety first there should be gas light installed in the pool, which should be lighted as soon as artificial
light is necessary. The serious consequences that might result from the pool being thrown into darkness by the blowing
out of main fuse is too evident to need much comment.

Fixptxncs oF Mr. McSHERRY’S INSPECTION TRIP.

Mr. MeSherry after an inspection trip throughout the

East last spring writes as follows:
July .

My dear Mr. Appel: .

I have been long time sending you report regarding
the conduct of swimming pool, the investigation and report
of which were one of my last duties in connection with the |
School Department.

My investigation proved to be successful check-up of
the eonduct of our local swimming pool. should say that
the way in which you are conducting the classes is in line
with the best things that saw in Providence, Springfield
and Boston. In the Sprinefield Y. M. C. A. they purify their
water for the pool by passing it over violet rays. They make
a specialty of cleanliness in the Boston Y. M. C. A. school—

see enclosed circular. When vou get chance you should
visit these places. My report is wholly favorable to the construction and operation of the Holvoke Pool.
 Sincerely yours,
F. McSHERRY. ;

The High School Pool is difficult plant to manage. In
order to give satisfaction to all the various parties using the
pool, cooperation is necessary. And am glad to report that
this has been fortheoming.”’

Mr. John P. Whalen has written about the Physical
Edueation work in the Ifieh Sehool as follows:

|

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

‘*The work in the Physical Edueation department of the
High School is carried on along the same lines as last year,
consisting of marching, calisthenics, apparatus work, games,

’ athletics and aquatics.

Regular gymnasium classes report twice each week, a
portion of one period week is devoted to aquatics. Each
boy is required to show that he is capable’ of swimming  
certain distance. Special instruction is given to those who —
cannot swim. During the year interelass meets were held in
basketball and swimming and these developed great deal |
of enthusiasm. Besides these, the boys held four swimming
meets with outside schools and displaved good ability.

| During gymnasium classes, games are held and varied
as the class develops. These games are taught to develop
poise, cooperation, skill, quick-thinking, self-control and
leadership. ;

Many more boys reported last vear for the various
athletic teams which are developed during the year.

Self-control and fairness: are the elements drilled into
the candidates along with team play and individual skill. |

A great deal of interest was shown in soccer this year, .
and championship team developed, which went to New
York to play the champions of New York State, and were
defeated by the seore of to  .

Physical training for girls has consisted of marehing,
tactics, grade exercises with and without hand apparatus,
folk and aesthetic daneing, games of low organization and
swimming during class periods. In the afternoon more time
is provided for games of higher organization, swimming,
daneing and apparatus work. Only upon recommendation
from physician are pupils excused from gymnasium work.

In the resignation of Miss McCaffrey the department
loses competent instructor, but the work is being earried
on in very capable manner by Miss Ruth Yoerg.’’ .

PART IL. ,
REPORT OF THE BOARD OF
TRUSTEES
To His Honor, the Mayor, and the Citizens of MWolyoke:

The Board of Trustees for Vocational Education respectfully submits the following, the seventh annual report, covering the year  .

’ Ever since this school started the question of properly
housing it has been much debated. The activities of the Vocaticnal School are practically those of light manufacturing
plant. Yet without adequate reinforcement, against the
advice of the State Board and the protest of the City Engineer, the school was installed in its present cramped and potentially dangerous quarters. ‘

The State Board's objection was so strong that in order
to gct the present location approved even temporarily, a
pledge had to be given by the eity and certain prominent citizns that suitable building would be provided at the earliest
possible date.  |

Holvoke usually keeps her promises. Both official and
individual Holyoke incurred definite obligation in this matter, and it seems as if the time had come to meet it.

The school itself has been and is severely handicapped by
the utter unsuitableness of the plant furnished. It cannot possibly expand in any direction. The Pattern Shop, supposed to
accommodate fifteen boys, now has twelve benches in it and no
room to put another. The Print Shop is without lnotype

|
or cylinder press and has no place to set up either, not to |
mention the faet that there might be trouble with the building
authorities over putting that much extra weight on the floor. |
Th Carpentry and Cabinet Department boys ore surfacing
jobs by hand, and when surfaced are attempting to finish
them in the dust-laden air of the shop. The Machine Shop,
by order of the Board of Public Works, was compelled to
move its planer into the basement two floors below as safety
precaution, and is now short of machines to accommodate its |
students.
| The membership of the Day School is at present the
greatest in its history and both the Trade’ Extension and ,
Practical Arts Sections are doing the kind of work which
draws back to them vear after year following of former )
pupils bringing with them their friends and associates.
The work undertaken in conjunction with the Federal
Board for the retraining of soldiers suffering from vocational
handicaps has made steady progress, and  now almost as
completely laid out and standardized as the regular work for ,
the boys.
. Because of the tremendous volume of business handled
by the Federal Rehabilitation Division, it is extremely diffieult
to perfect the equipment of this school through the regular |
Government channels, and it may be desirable for the city
to purchase the little necessary machinery which is almost
certain to be paid for later on under the hill to reimburse
cities and towns retraining ex-soldiers for all expenditures
not covered by tuition fees, State reimbursement and Smith- |
Ilughes’ funds. Holyoke is in position to perform this .
service and we should be proud to render it to any ex-soldier |
regardless of his place of residence or nativity, whether repayment does or does not come. ,
It seems highly probable that these retraining schools for
the soldiers are leading the way toward the solution of an
economic difficulty which has troubled the world for years,

REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS  
namely, what to do with the eripples of industry. It is
evident that if we can retrain, and make valuable industrially,
men suffering from war-inflicted handicaps; it is just as
possible to salvage in the same way the victims of our mill
and railroad accidents. The rehabilitation school for the

soldier may be forerunner of rehabilitation schools for his
peace time maimed brother. Why not? We will have the
equipments, we will have the teachers and the experience. |
Ifumanity demands that we continue to use then.

The Continuation School, which this Board was asked
by the School Committee to organize in compliance with the
Act of the Legislature passed in  was opened here in
September. At the beginning of the new fiseal year, it
having become apparent that conditions made such course
wise, it was returned to the direct control of the School Board.

The high standard attained by Vocational Education in
this city is indicated by Ictters received from Mr. R. O. Small,
Director of the Division of Vocational Education for the State
of Massachusetts, notifyng us that all work under the jurisdiction of this Board for the past year has received State
approval and been recommended for maximum reimbursement.

Since the first meeting of the first Board of Trustees for
Vocational Education in this city in December of the
progress of this work has been guided and advanced largely
through the efforts of one man. Mr. Francis McSherry, the
first Executive Officer of the Board of Trustees, is entitled
to much of the credit for whatever has been accomphshed
here in this comparatively new field of education, and it is
with deepest regret we chronicle the severance of his connection with the organization. Mr. MecSherry’s resignation took
effect April and M. S. Herbert, who has been
identified with the school for several years, was elected to
sucd him.

All statistics will be found in the-report of the Executive
Officer. .
