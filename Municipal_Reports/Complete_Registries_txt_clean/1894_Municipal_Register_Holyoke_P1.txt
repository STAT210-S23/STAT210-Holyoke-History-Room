MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
Gentlemen of the City Council :

Elected by our fellow-citizens to conduct the business of the city for the current year, we have met this
morning to take the oath of office, and assume the
duties of our respective positions.

, According to custom, it becomes my duty to pre, sent to you the situation of the different departments,
with such suggestions relating to the work of the
future as may now be clearly apprehended.

The financial condition of the city is as follows:

length of time to insure low rate of interest, with a
provision for payment into the Sinking Fund of a
sufficient amount yearly for payment at maturity.

The amount which the city can now borrow under
the debt limit statute,  .

It is hardly necessary for us to say that this narrow margin admonishes us to be very careful in enterIng into any new or large expenditures which are not
imperatively demanded.

SCHOOLS.

This department, one of the most important and
certainly the most expensive, merits your serious attention. The expenditures for the year amounted to
$ an increase over the previous year of
$ and an increase over the estimate at the beginning of the year of .

This increase of expenditure was caused by the
opening of new schools in Elmwood and Ward One, to
accommodate the increasing school population, and the
building of the High School addition, the cost of
which was charged to the contingent fund of the
school department.

This latter item amounted to and the
Increase of teachers’ salaries over the preceding year
was, in round numbers, .

  Mayor's Adtress.
The number of schoolhouses owned by the city is
 containing regular school-rooms. In addition
! to these, eight schools are now occupying outside or \
irregular rooms. QOne hundred and thirty teachers are
required to take care of these schools. The enrollment of pupils for the year .
In our rapidly growing city constant demand for
increased accommodations for our schools is to be
expected, and though new rooms were added in the
past year, there ts still need of additional room in Ward
One, where four schools are now held in outside and
inconvenient rooms; also in Oakdale to accommodate that rapidly growing section and relieve the overcrowded South Chestnut and other buildings.
The need of new high school building is very
pressing, and if the financial condition of the city will )
permit, it would seem wise to purchase alot and adopt
plans during the year. commend to your careful perusal the lengthy and exhaustive report of the School
Committee and Superintendent.
CITY ENGINEER.
The report of the City Engineer is full and comprehensive, both in regard to the work done in the past
year, and as to the needs of the present year. ‘
The most of his recommendations come to us in
reports from other departments, but suggest to you
a careful study of his report, that we may have thorMayor's Adiress.  
ough understanding of the condition of the city property, and be able to judge wisely between expenditures
that are imperative and those which may be desirable
but can be deferred without damage to the interests of
the city.

The expense of this office for the year closed has
been It seems to me that smaller sum
will suffice in this year.
HIGHWAYS.

The report of the Superintendent of Strects  s
voluminous, but clear, and will repay careful study.

His total expenditures were of which
$  was for permanent work, like the paving of
High and Dwight streets, and the widening of Northampton street and the Springfield road. The balance
was for bridge planking, graveling and general repairs
on streets and country roads. [‘rom personal knowledge of our country roads do not hesitate to say
that they have been kept in excellent condition during
the year. Much remains to be done in the line of
permanent work upon our city streets.

The continuation of the asphalt paving on High
street, from Essex to Cabot, seems desirable if finances
will permit. Some permanent work should be commenced on Appleton street, from the New York &
New Haven railroad crossing westerly, as far as an
appropriation can be made to cover.

  Mayor's Address.

An experiment in macadamizing on Dwight street,
from Maple to Elm, has been made the past year. If
this roadway (which is adopted in many cities of our
state) meets with your approval, it would probably be
economy to purchase steam roller, at cost of about
$ rather than to hire one at  per day.

I call your particular attention to the recommendations of the Superintendent of Streets as to the
permanent work desired upon various streets. Whatever can be done in the line of permanent road-beds
Is wise economy in the end.

SEWERS.

The great outlay on the I:lmwood and Oakdale
sewer system, amounting to over Ought to ,
entitle us toa rest in this department the present year.
The ordinary sewer expenditure was 

No large amount will be called for in this line as.
far as am advised, unless it be on repairs of the Jackson street sewer, which the Superintendent considers
ina dangerous condition.

This matter will doubtless receive your early and
careful consideration.

SIDEWALKS. |

Nine thousand five hundred and twelve dollars
and forty-six cents has been expended in this department.

Mayor's Address. II

Some of the old walks need repairing or renewing, but am not informed that any extensive demand
for new walks is to be anticipated. moderate appropriation for this department will suffice.

FUEL AND STREET LIGHTS.

This department shows an expenditure of  during the year, of which amount about 
was for fuel for the various city buildings, and nearly
$  for street lights. The number of lights in
use is as follows :—
Electric costing 
Gas  
It will be seen that our street lights are maintained at
an average cost of one hundred dollars per year, a
larger price, think, than most cities are required to
pay.

Our contract with the Holyoke Electric Light Co.
expires during this year, and if the contract  to be
renewed suggest that it be after most careful inquiry
as to the cost in other cities. It would seem that our
local company is as favorably situated to furnish lights
cheaply as any other company in our commonwealth.

Petitions for new lights are constantly coming to
the city council. If we remember that the granting
of one light entails permanent charge of one hundred dollars year upon the city, we should be careful

  Mayor's Address,
to grant only such as are needful for the safety of our
streets.

WATER COMMISSIONERS.

The report of the Water Commissioners is very
favorable one. They have added to the Sinking Fund
$ making the total of this fund an
amount quite sufficient with its natural increment to
retire the issue of water bonds, at maturity
in the year  .

The total receipts have been .

The constantly increasing demands on our water
supply and the nearness of failure to meet that demand during the past year, admonish us that an
additional supply must be sought in the near future.

Our commissioners are fully alive to the situation, )
and commend to your careful consideration whatever
propositions they submit during the year.

LIQUOR LICENSES.

This vexatious and troublesome question has happily been removed from the immediate control of the
board of aldermen by the appointment of license
commission, under the provisions of an act passed by —
the last Legislature. |

The character of this commission is sufficient |
guarantee that the best possible results will be obtained
in this line.

Mayor's Address.  

I am informed that the licensees of the commission have faithfully observed the conditions imposed
upon them, and, taking this for granted, they are entitled to protection against illegal selling.

POLICE.

The police department remains the same as last
year, namely, one marshal, one assistant marshal, one
captain, one lieutenant and thirty-four patrolmen.

Suggestions are made by the marshal and others
that the force should be increased by the appointment
of from two to four additional patrolmen. Iam not
prepared to recommend this at present.

This will be matter for future consideration.

The report of the City Marshal is worthy of your
attention. He calls particular attention to the large
increase of ‘‘tramps” during the year. This question
IS vexatious one, not only to the police department,
but to our citizens in general, who are subjected to
great annoyance by the visits and importunities of these

 men of the road. recommend to you careful
inquiry into the methods pursued by other cities in dealing with this question, to the end that we may, as
far as possible, abate and control this nuisance.
— Strict morality, sobriety, obedience and firm discipline should be the inflexible rule in this important
branch of the city service. Failure to observe this rule
should be met with swift and sure punishment.

  Mayor's Address.

ORDINANCES AND CITY CHARTER.

A movement was made during the last year toward |
revising and codifying the city ordinances, but resulted in no action. suggest that this matter be given
early attention by the appointment of committee from
the city council, or commission outside of the body,
as may scem wisest to the council.

Much has been said in the public print and by
many citizens of the need of new city charter. The
present charter, adopted twenty years ago when the
city had population of fourteen thousand, may be
poorly fitted for city of our forty thousand population.

I am not prepared to make recommendation in the
matter, but commend it to your thoughtful consideration, only reminding you that whatever is done must
be attended to very soon, in order that it may be presented to the Legislature in due season.
PAUPER DEPARTMENT.

The report of the Overseers of the Poor indicates
that the poor are still with us, and have been well cared
for in the past.

The total net expenditures have been :
of which sum  was expended for the Alms- |
house and the balance for outdoor poor, including
insane persons at asylum.

Mayor's Address.  

I call your attention to the need expressed by the
board of an addition to the insane department building
at the Almshouse.

The board justly refers in terms of commendation
to the late warden of the Almshouse, William A. Judd,
who died in the service, after having been connected
with the department more than twenty years. During
all this time he gave faithful service to the city, and
kind, considerate attention to the unfortunate.

FIRE DEPARTMENT.

This department maintains its well deserved record
for efficiency of service.

The report of the commissioners gives the total
number of fires for the year as  .

The amount of property endangered was nearly a
million and quarter of dollars, and the total damage
$ on which the insurance paid was ,
leaving net loss to our citizens of an average
loss of  for each fire. most extraordinary
record, and one that speaks loudly in praise of the skill
and work of the officers and men in the department.

The total expenditure of the year was .

The report of the commissioners is full of interesting data, as well as of recommendations for the
improvement and strengthening of the service though
lengthy, it is worthy of your careful perusal, and |
doubt not will receive it, with thoughtful attention to

  Mayor's Address.
the many suggestions for the expenditure of money
for new equipment.
CITY SOLICITOR.

The report of the City Solicitor shows that his
department has been well and ably managed during the
year, inasmuch as no settlements have been made of |
cases against the city, outside of the courts, and in
every case that has come to trial the city has been victorious.

The Solicitor has adopted the rule to “try every
case,” and this rule seems to have had the salutary
effect of discouraging suits against the city.

So many frivolous cases are brought against the
city for injuries received on our streets, which are usually the result of carelessness of the persons injured,
that some deterrent action of this kind seemed necessary.

There are still many cases pending against the city
of various kinds, for full list of which refer you to
the Solicitor’s report.

BOAKD OF HEALTH.

The report of this board, which may also include
the report of the City Physician, and the Inspector of
Plumbing, has much of interest for your consideration.

The general health of the city has been good, though

the City Physician reports large increase of calls and

Mayor's Address.  
of medicine used, which he attributes to the fact that
many people called upon him for services who in more
prosperous times would have employed their own physician.

Early in the year smallpox epidemic broke out
in Ward Three, but by prompt and vigorous measures
put in force, it was confined to limited area, with
twenty-nine cases and three deaths resulting.

The total cost to the city of this epidemic was
$ .

The board highly commends the operation of the
new plumbing ordinance enacted during the past year,
and the service of the Inspector—Mr. Joseph Murray.
You will doubtless find it necessary to give immediate
attention to the request of the board for new dumping place for the city garbage collected from the
alleys.

The present places are insufficient and so far
removed from the center of the city that the cost of
cartage is greatly enhanced.

The expenditure in this department was and the board asks for an appropriation of
$  for the present year.

CONCLUSION.

In conclusion, gentlemen, crave your support
and co-operation in carrying on the affairs of our city.

  Mayor's Address.

The city is great business corporation; we are
the board of directors and managers we have accepted
the trust and have assumed the responsibilities with a
solemn oath. :

Let us divest ourselves of all partisanship and
seek only the highest interests of our city.

In our votes and decisions upon the various matters coming before us, let us be governed only by our
conclusions as to what will best conserve the highest
interests of our city, after faithful and conscientious
study.

If we discharge our duties upon this basis we
shall not fail to meet the just expectations of our fellow citizens who have honored us with their suffrages,
and, what is of more importance, we shall have the
approval of our own consciences.

Let us remember that

‘‘ Honor and fame from no condition rise ;
Act well your part, there all the honor lies.”

Report of Water Board.  

There has been very little repairing done to our
reservoirs during the course of the past year by reason
of their healthy and otherwise excellent condition.

We completed the raising of the roadway on the
south-easterly side of Ashley Pond. This was begun
in the previous year. It was on account of the overflowing of the ponds on this side that we were forced
to prosecute this work the water was wasted and the
way was rendered impassable to people in vehicles or
on foot. The elevation of the roadway has obviated
this great inconvenience to travelers, and by it the
water is held in its proper place and the containing
capacity of the pond is increased.

The protection of the thickly-settled locality in
the neighborhood of Suffolk street has been improved
by laying on that street to-inch main from High to
Walnut streets, an  -inch main from Walnut to Oak
streets, and  -inch main from the latter street to
Linden street. Hydrants have been placed at most
advantageous points along the sides of the street.

Another most useful main was laid on Canal
street from Appleton to Mosher street.

In completing this work we have given to the
large factories in the lower section of the city ample
protection in times of fire they have also at their disposal two direct mains of equal pressure, either of
which can be used when leaks or other damages make
it necessary.

  Report of Water Board.

Restrictions on the use of hose for washing windows and sprinkling purposes have been the cause of
much inconvenience to our people and of decrease
in the revenues to this department. This, of late years,
has been common and annual occurrence. We
would that we were not called upon to make such restrictions. That we are, however, obliged to make
them during the warm, dry and dusty weather ts because the reservoirs during the spring months never
fill, it matters not how much care we exercise or what
our efforts are to prevent any unnecessary waste of
water.

You remember that, in July, your honorable
council were notified of the scarcity of water, and that
you were, in consequence, earnestly requested to take
from the canals whatever water you needed for the
sprinkling of the streets. You remember also the
daily and weekly notices in our daily papers whereby
we enjoined upon all the sparing use of the hose. You
can easily call to mind that we limited its use to one
hour per day for three days each week, and that the
residents of the Highlands and Elmwood were ordered
to use their hose on specified days alternately with the
people of the lower parts of the city. This was
ordered with the hope that the pressure, which was
then too small to raise the water even to the second
floor of our ordinary dwelling-houses, might become
greater.

Report of Water Board.  

In August, the water in the ponds became so
alarmingly low by virtue of the scarcity of rains that
we were moved to make preparations for the much
dreaded and yet expected water famine. The methods
of relief which we were about to adopt—and seemingly the only advisable ones were to pump water
from the river, either immediately into the pipes, or
into the Whiting Street reservoir. In this emergency,
however, we sought and obtained from the State
Board of Health advice as to the more  sanitary
method. Here is what the chief engineer of the State
Board wrote :

OFFICE OF STATE Boarp oF HEALTH. )
Boston, Sept. |
Board of Water Commissioners, Holyoke, Mass.

Dear Siks: Your communication of September
 relative to pumping water from the Connecticut
River into the Whiting Street Reservoir, and inquiring
if there is any objection on the part of the State
Board of Health to such action, without filtration, has
been referred to me for reply.

The experience of polluted streams as sources of
water supply in Massachusetts has been very unfavorable, as there have been epidemics of typhoid fever in
most cases where such sources have been used, notably at Lowell, Lawrence, and Newburyport, which
have taken water from the Merrimac River, and at

  Report of Water Board.
Chicopee Falls, which has taken water from the Chic- opee River. In  the city of Hartford, Conn.,
which usually obtains its water supply from storage
reservoirs, on account of the failure of the regular
supply pumped water from the Connecticut River,
and the use of the river water was followed by a
marked increase in the number of cases of typhoid
fever in that city, which is referred to in paper in
the report of the Connecticut State Board of Health
for  In all these cases which have mentioned
the water was pumped directly from the stream to the
consumers.

It would, undoubtedly, be safer to use the Connecticut River water after it had stood month or
more inthe Whiting Street Reservoir than it would be
to pump it into the pipes directly from the river, but I
do not believe that either method would be safe, and
I therefore advise you to seek some other method of
supplementing the supply.

We should be very glad to analyze sample of
water from the river for you, if we felt that it would
do any good; but in this case the danger does not
come from the impurities which can be detected by
chemical analysis, but rather from infectious matter
which cannot be detected by chemical analysis, and
which may enter the river with the sewage of Easthampton and Northampton, or other places. As the
specific infection of typhoid fever and other diseases

communicable by water may be in the water only
occasionally, there is no test that know of which will
prove whether the water is safe or not. We have to

Report of Water Board.  
depend more upon our experience with such waters
in causing disease.

Respectfully yours,
F. P. STEARNS,
Chief Engineer.

This cautious and timely advice led us to go
slowly in the erection of pumping station which we
had already planned. The necessary pipe, however,
had been purchased and soundings were made along
the river bank for the purpose of selecting the most
suitable place for filter gallery. pump with
  capacity was held in readiness by the Deane
Steam Pump Company in case we should need it; but
as we did not put this pump to use we were under no
obligation to purchase it.

After the season advanced somewhat, and before
we were put to any expense other than the purchase
of some pipe which now can be utilized in the laying
of ordinary mains, the fall rains came to our rescue and
saved us from what would otherwise have been most
critical condition. The estimated expense of putting
in this pumping station and filter gallery was .
This sum if applied to some permanent addition to our
present system would aid materially in the payment of
the same.

The experience of the last summer then must be,
to the observing and interested citizen, most forcible argument in discussing and deciding the question

  Report of Water Board.
whether our water supply should be increased, or not.
We advocate an immediate increase, for we feel that
when the pressure at certain times of the year is not
strong enough to drive the water in the pipes to the
second floor of the houses on the Highlands, no too |
active measures can be taken to relieve the people of
this unhappy inconvenience.
We have done our utmost to bring them relief.
We have gone as far as we were permitted to go in
the business of increasing our water supply. Munn’s
brook, Granville, Mass., to our minds, was the place
that offered the necessary relief; but in our efforts to
secure the right of taking water therefrom we have
encountered serious objections on the part of the town
of Westfield. We feel, however, that we have done
everything in our power to bring about successful }
issue to the contest between us. hasty glance at |
what we did in our business relations with them and
others will readily show this.
In the early part of January,  we had printed
  copies of the reports of Engineers McClintock
and Tighe, which compare the several available water
sources, one with the other, and give many convincing
reasons why Munn’s brook is the best suited to the
wants of our growing city. The water therein, they
tell us, is pure and wholesome and suitable to domestic purposes. It is of sufficient quantity, too, to
meet our demands, though we should increase in

number to the hundreds of thousands, for an indefinite
number of years; furthermore, it can be conveniently
conducted into Ashley pond, and thus make saving
of continual outlay of dollars for pumps, etc.; and
at the same time our department for many years to
come will not be compelled to build any storage reserVoIrs.

Having full confidence in the recognized ability
of the aforesaid engineers, and relying upon their
honesty and good judgment, we took steps to gain
possession of this most desirable source. Our  petition, praying for the right to take said waters, was
properly filed, and, in due time, submitted to the State
Committee on Water Supply. The first hearing was
given at the State House, Boston, March .
There was no strong opposition in evidence at first.
Still, the representatives of the towns of Westfield
and West Springfield asked that the hearing prod
with the understanding that the remonstrants have an
Opportunity at some future time to enter their protest.
At this first sitting of the committee our case was almost wholly submitted. The adjourned meeting took
place at Springfield, March when the remonstrants presented theirside of the case. The committee, finding that even at this hearing all parties interested could not be fully heard, kindly continued the
hearing to March at the State House, Boston.
A full expression of opinion pro and con was here

given and the case was closed. Weare satisfied that
our petition was most ably presented, and our only
regret is that the committee did not see fit to give a
decision in our favor. The petition was referred to
the Legislature of  ‘This temporary postponement of our request does not discourage us for we feel
that ours is just cause, and that our efforts are made
for the happiness and convenience of our people. We
intend to urge the justice and importance of our claims
upon the law-makers in this present Legislature. We
call upon you to give us your most hearty co-operation, since “in union there is strength.”

The condition of our sinking fund, which we
herewith submit, warrants us in saying that the revenue of our department, less the actual cost of maintenance, can be applied to the payment of the expense
incurred. The fact that we have actually in this fund
$  is sufficient guarantee that our water
bonds, when they mature in  can be easily met,
and that, too, without any transfers other than the  
per centum of the principal required by the water act.

This pleasing condition of our sinking fund certainly reflects great credit upon the wisdom and  foresight of our first boards of water commissioners. Their
plans to develop and perfect our system of water )
works so as to give our people good and pure water at
reasonable rates have surely been crowned with success. These same plans have enabled our predecesReport of Water Board.  
sors and ourselves to meet the running expenses of
the department and to pay dollar for dollar the , , the construction cost of our water system.
Moreover, we are now able to meet at the specified
time the maturing bonds of and to continue to furnish the people of our thriving city with
water at the lowest price of any city in the commonwealth.

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSION.
OFFICE OF FIRE CoMMISSIONERS,
December ,
To the Honorable Mayor and City Council.

GENTLEMEN In accordance with the requirements
of the city ordinance, the Board of Fire Commissioners present their annual report for the year ending
December ,

On the first day of February, A. D.  the
board organized by the choice of Charles L. Newcomb
as chairman, and John Hildreth as secretary.

We feel that our citizens have reason to be proud
of our Fire Department, and that the department
never was in so good condition before. The men
have shown promptness and ready and cheerful
obedience at all times, and notwithstanding the fact
that we have had very large number of fires, the fire
losses are surprisingly small, and they might have
been considerably smaller if the recommendations of
the Fire Commissioners had been adopted, to wit: the
purchase of chemical fire engine and the placing of
 -gallon tanks in each hose wagon under the driver’s
seat. very large per cent. of our fires are put out
by fire extinguishers, but they are too small to do

  Report of Fire Commission.
much service when fire has gained much headway.
We therefore respectfully urge, that in making up the
appropriations for fire department work, you will provide for modern chemical fire engine and for chemical tanks on all hose carts, and for two new horses for
the two hose wagons in Ward Seven. It is both cruel
and poor economy to run these two heavy wagons
with one horse on each wagon. They have to make
long runs, and during the winter months have often to
break out the roads, and the time lost in getting to
fires is invaluable.
We have held twenty regular meetings during the
year, besides many informal ones. We have received
and examined twenty-six applicants for membership in
the various companies, and thirty-one applications for |
permanent positions in the department, and have made
six appointments to fill vacancies.
We have this year employed the permanent men,
when not on fire duty, making zincs for fire alarm use
and making the charges for fire extinguishers, thereby
saving during the year quite large sum of money to
the city.
ee |
|
MANUAL FORCE. |
The manual force of the department has been
increased by the appointment of an engineer and
stoker for Engine No.  The department has had a

Report of Five Commission.  
good deal of practice drill work during the last summer, thereby increasing their efficiency very much.

The permanent force on the department is classified as follows :

Chief, Superintendent of Fire Alarm Telegraph,
engineer steamer No.  fourteen drivers, one tillerman,
and three men on Hook and Ladder No.  Total,
twenty-one permanent men.

The call force consists of five assistant engineers,
five engineers of steamers, six stokers of steamers and

 hose and ladder men and twenty-one substitutes,
making total of available for fire duty.

We again call your attention to our recommendation, that the department can be greatly strengthened
and improved by the employment of more permanent
men, especially in the suburbs. Experience has shown
that small force always ready for service is to be
preferred to large call force. Influential petitions
have been received by the Commission signed by the
residents of the suburbs asking for the appointment of
permanent men in their districts, giving as reason
for such appointments the fact that nearly all the male
residents are down town during the day, leaving them
almost entirely unprotected during the day. And we
ask your honorable body to make sufficient appropriations so that we can grant these petitions.

  Report of Fire Commission.
APPARATUS.
During the year we have purchased heaters for i
engines No. and No.  so that all our engines ex- |
cept the reserve engine, No.  and engine No.  all |
start to fires with hot water, so that by the time they |
arrive at fire they have steam. The apparatus now
in active service consists of steam fire engines,  
two-horse hose wagons, one-horse hose wagons, I
aerial hook and ladder truck, hook and ladder trucks,
  exercise and supply wagons, chief's buggy,  
superintendent fire alarm wagon and sleigh. The ap- .
paratus isin good order except hose wagon No.  ,
which needs considerable repairs to make it safe, and
the old engine No.  which is to be used only in an
emergency. Again we recommend that the rotary
La France be disposed of and lighter engine purchased.
HOSE.
Owing to the fact that no money was at our disposal for this purpose, we have purchased no hose
this year. We have in the department hose as follows:
High Street house, feet; Steamer No. 
feet Steamer No.  feet; Steamer No.  F
feet; Steamer No.  feet; Hose No. feet; total, feet, of which feet is poor,
leaving feet of good hose.

Report of Fire Commission.  

We should purchase at least feet the coming year, so as to keep our department well supplied.

HORSES.

Veterinary Goodwin reports twenty-seven horses,
all in good condition. We have purchased nine new
horses during the past year, transferred two to the
pauper department and sold four, and we have put 
one extra horse on hose No.  hose  hose and
hose  .

HAY AND FEED.

We are all out of both. Several times during the
year being entirely out of both bedding and feed;
cause, no money in the repairand contingent account.

HOUSES. |

With the exception of the High Street engine
house, all the houses are in good condition. This
house is in very poor repair, needing painting and
repairing all through; indeed, as the Commissioners
think, new house in better location, as the house
is altogether too small for the apparatus. We again
respectfully call your attention to the unprotected
Oakdale district, and urge that either you build small

  Report of Fire Commission.

engine house and locate chemical fire engine there,

or open St. Jerome avenue so that this rapidly growing section may have the advantage of the Highland ,
department.

We have put electric lights in all the engine
houses possible, thereby saving large sum to the
city, and we now keep the lanterns burning on all
apparatus all night, so that it is not necessary to use
as much gas.

TELEPHONES.

The telephone service has been all that could be
desired. Our experience has shown the great value
of this branch of our department.

The Commissioners, on behalf of the city, thank
the telephone company for their generous offer in case
of large fire to place at our disposal capable man
and all their wires free of charge.

FIRE ALARM TELEGRAPH.

This branch of the department under Superintendent Castle has more than maintained its previous
high standing. The importance of this branch cannot
be over-rated, the safety of the city depends upon the
apparatus in this department working properly.

The Fire Commissioners believe that it is good
policy to have plenty of fire alarm boxes, so that in no

Report of Fire Commtssion.  
part of the city would citizen have far to run to reach
a fire alarm box, and we urge our citizens not to wait
until the fire has got beyond them before pulling in a
box, but ring the alarm as soon as fire is discovered,
so that department may get to work before the fire
assumes serious proportions. If the alarm is rung at
once nearly all our fires can be put out with chemical
fire extinguishers, with very little loss.

The service now consists of five circuits, and one
SIX Circuit repeater seventy-eight non-interference
fre alarm boxes; forty-six owned.by the city and
thirty-two by private firms. Two new boxes have
been added during the year and are numbered as follows:  City Hospital;  corner of Essex and
Maple. Three other boxes were petitioned for, which

| Commission voted to put in, but lack of funds prevented. The rapid growth of our city will make it
necessary to still further extend our system.

We again draw the attention of your honorable
city council to the fact that the safety of the property
in Circuit No. demands that it be divided. It is
altogether too long. We also call your attention to
the fact that it will be necessary to furnish the new
engine house in Springdale with new tower bell and
striker, and one  -inch gong and indicator combined,
to call out the department in this section of the city.

We again recommend that separate circuits be
constructed with small gongs, these to be placed in the

  Report of Fire Commission.
homes of the members of the call force, so that members would know when and where all fires were, and
we could then depend on having them at the fires.
Two miles of wire have been taken down and
replaced with new during the past year. There is on
hand in this department one-half mile of line wire,  
pole brackets, goo locust pole pins, goo pounds of
blue vitriol, gravity battery jars, and gravity
zincs. ‘
The property in this branch of the department is
as follows:
  miles of wire, 
  tower bells and strikers,  
I  -circuit repeater,   battery cells,  mechanical gongs,   telegraph poles,   strong current protectors, Gamwell signal boxes, Gamwell signal boxes (private),  -inch gongs and indicators combined, indicators without gongs, fire alarm tappers in engineers’ houses,

FIRES AND ALARMS.
During the past twelve months there have been
  fires and alarms, of which were rung in from
signal boxes, of which were false alarms, still
alarms, fires where no alarm was given, that were
in Chicopee, and one call for help from Northampton
on March  .
Total amount of property endangered by fire was
as follows:
Buildings and contents, 
Total insurance,  
Total damage,  
Total insurance paid,  
Loss above insurance,  
Average loss on fires and alarms,  
One hundred and thirty-one fires and alarms with
a gross loss of only and net loss of only
$  to our citizens, speaks volumes for the
efficiency of our department. During the last five
years the aggregate fire loss has been as follows:
Total loss, covered by insurance, Net
loss, not covered by insurance, Number

equalled, and it seems to us that we are entitled to
lower insurance rates than we now receive. We have
spared no necessary expenditure to fully equip our |
department, and our citizens ought to get the benefit
of lower rates.
Carelessness in the use of kerosene and gasoline
is responsible for large number of our fires, and we
urge our citizens to exercise greater care in the use of
these articles.

have to spend, and we will try not to exd that
amount. |

) REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT
OF STREETS.
To the Honorable, the Mayor and City Council of the
City of Holyoke.

GENTLEMEN: have the honor to submit the following report as summary of the work in the several
departments under the supervision of this office for
the year  .

The total expenditure in the highway department
was of which  was spent for
permanent work, such as the paving of High street

; from Appleton to Essex street, square yards at
$  per yard, .

The paving of Dwight street, from High to Maple
street, square yards at per yard, .
The difference of the cost of paving the above streets
is caused by the fitting of blocks between the electric
car tracks. |

The macadamizing of Dwight street from Maple
to Elm street, square yards at  cents per
yard, The macadamizing of Ely street from
Bowers to Center street, square yards at  
cents per yard, The widening of Springfield road, The widening of Northampton

  Report of Superintendent of Streets.
street and on High street from Essex to Cabot street.
Also the paving with granite blocks of Cabot street
street, One thousand, one hundred and
eighty-three dollars and one cent was spent for replank- |
ing bridges, leaving  for graveling and general repairs on streets and country roads.
The new policy adopted this year of macadamizing our streets should be continued, and would
respectfully recommend that steam road roller be
purchased at once, so that work may be started as soon
as the weather will permit in the spring.
Something should be done to improve Appleton
street from High to Pleasant street. Several hundred |
dollars are expended annually for repairs, but this will \
never give satisfactory results until some radical rem- !
edy is applied. The roadway between the street car
tracks and the curbing ts so narrow that all vehicles are
compelled to travel in one and the same rut.
Therefore, respectfully recommend that the
curbing on both sides of the street be set back three !
feet, which would allow six feet for walk and three
feet for grass plot, thereby gaining three feet for the
roadway on each side of the tracks, and the wear on
the street would not be restricted to that narrow roadway which now exists. Curbing should be laid on
both sides of the street from Bh to Pleasant street.
The asphalt paving should be extended on Appleton,
Suffolk and Hampden streets from High to Maple

Report of Superintendent of Streets.  
from Race street easterly, and Sargeant street from
Main street to second level canal bridge.

; Our country roads can be greatly improved by
purchasing portable stone crusher and roller combined. There are thousands of tons of stone piled up
along said roads that are carted off the fields by farmers
in that locality where no gravel is to be obtained, which
could be crushed and rolled to make good roads. The
ledges which now exist on the Rock Valley road
might be blasted and crushed and used for road

, dressing, thereby reducing the grade on the steep
hills, to the great comfort and relief of the public
who are obliged to travel these roads.

 SIDEWALKS.

The total expenditure in this department was
$ of which  was spent for new walks
and  for repairs on old walks.

A large portion of our city walks are in defective condition and liberal appropriation should be
set aside for the repairing of the same. The city
has been too lenient in enforcing the law in regard to
removing snow from walks, which has resulted in paying several thousand dollars this year for people being
injured by falling on icy walks.

A strict enforcement of said law would be beneficial to everybody.

  Report of Superintendent of Streets.
SEWERS.

The total expenditure in this department was
$ of which  was spent for lateral
sewers,  for building catch basins, and
$  for cleaning catch basins and sewers.

The opening up of new streets, filling in of low
lands, the building of number of catch basins and
the turning of all surface water into the sewers, has
proven that the sewer system on the Highlands will
have to be enlarged or separate system for surface
drainage adopted. |

I again call your attention to the unsafe condition
of sections of the Jackson street sewer which are
liable to break away at any time.

The intention of the city government of |
was, when the Jackson street trunk sewer was completed, that the sewer on Canal and Jackson streets
should be relaid, but nothing has been done as yet.
During heavy rain storms number of cellars are |
flooded and something should be done to relieve this
evil.

At the request of the Board of Health, was

again called upon to flush out sewers in Ward Six.
I would respectfully recommend that, instead of flushing sewers with fire hose, flush gates be connected
with the sewers; these, placed at the extreme ends of
sewers, when open, flush clean the sewers their whole
length.

Report of Superintendent of Streets.  
ELMWOOD AND OAKDALE SEWER SYSTEM.
, The total expenditure in this department this year
was of which  was spent for the
trunk sewer from the Connecticut river to South
street;  was spent for the sewer in the
dingle between South and Franklin streets; and the
balance, for lateral sewers. The system has
been in use for several weeks, to the comfort and relief

of the people benefited.

STREET WATERING.
The total expenditure in this department was
‘  of which  was spent for two new carts;
$  for painting and repairing the same, and 
for labor.

I would respectfully recommend the purchase of
two new carts, to replace old carts which are beyond
repair.

Thanking the members of the city council and the
various officials associated with me in the discharge of
my duties for their co-operation and support, respect| fully submit this report.

  Report of Police Department.
While there is marked decrease in the number
of arrests, there is an increase in the number arrested
for intemperance. think this is owing to the lack of |
steady employment during the past year.
We still find disorderly houses—for there is class
of women who will not work while they can get living otherwise. With them moral suasion is of little
avail and, as rule, they seldom reform.
Although our accommodations are not as good as
they might be we have many calls for lodging. When !
we can compatibly do so we give our women clean
bed in the detention room, and we always provide |
them with refreshments when needed.

Take the police force entirely out of politics. It
can be done. The members of the force at present
have the liberal protection that the life tenure system
insures. There is no need for them to court politics.
In many cases they do so to the detriment of the

directing the force; in any case of defection the

such members of the force as come before them for

on their beats and compels their regularity of duties.

A patrol wagon is an absolute need of the department. Consider city of Holyoke’s area, population
and number of arrests, with no patrol wagon.

| An equipment made this year, enabling the force
to make more impressive appearance on parade, was
the provision of new clubs and belts.

The case of one patrolman which was pending at
the beginning of the department year was settled by
the retiring board of aldermen, who reinstated him.
Later in the year he was suspended by me for similar offense, and, after due hearing, the present board
reinstated him with loss of pay for the period of his
suspension.

With the growth of the city, the opening of new
streets and suburban building, there is need of more
policemen. It is probable that added licenses will
