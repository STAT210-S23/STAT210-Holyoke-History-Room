After thirteen vears of faithful service William G. Lee,
the architect of this department, resigned his position in order
to go to live in California, where he has large interests in the
fruit business.

Mr. Lee was always most conscientious and painstaking
in the performance of his work, and not only this department
but the city has lost the services of an architect of ability, as
ean be seen in the beauty of the buildings designed by him.

Respectfully submitted, ;
JAMES L. TIGHE,
City Engineer.

REPORT OF THE
Inspector of Buildings
To His Honor, the Mayor, and the Board of Aldermen:

GENTLEMEN: The first annual report of the Inspector of
Buildings and Electric Wiring is hereby respectfully submitted.

The total expenditures of this department from December
  to December including stationery, office supplies, printing, advertising, assistant, team hire, car fare, and
traveling expenses, were .

INSPECTIONS.

Inspections included new buildings erected during the
vear; additions to and alterations in old buildings; installations of electric wiring for light, heat and power; hotels,
boarding houses and elevators.

The number of inspections is as follows:

INSPECTION OF BUILDINGS.
Additions and alterations to,  
Public schools and institutions  
Apartment blocks  
Wooden houses.  
Factories, ete. —.  
Business and tenement blocks  
Barns, varages, ete.  
Building permits issued  
Hotels and boarding houses  
Elevators (not complete) —.  

REPORT OF INSPECTOR OF BUILDINGS.  
ELECTRIC WIRING.

Specifications filed for electric wiring  

Inspections (estimated  

Plans were inspected, approved, indexed and filed for all

new buildings over two tenements as required by the ordinances. These plans are kept in ‘filing cabinet, to which
access can be had by the public on application. ,

The intelligent co-operation of architects, contractors and
property owners has greatly assisted me in the work of building inspection. ,

Strict adherence to the ordinances has raised our building
standard, resulting in more favorable loans and better insurance rates. Few violations have occurred during the year,
and these were due principally to misinterpretation of the
ordinances. In all cases the trouble was adjusted without
reference to the courts.

The annual inspection of hotels and boarding houses was
made during the month of May, as required by law, and all
sleeping rooms were found to be equipped with the necessary
means of escape in case of fire.

ORDINANCES.

The problem of light and air in tenement buildings impressed itself forcibly on me during the early part of the year.
The existing building ordinance made no provision against
dark and ill-ventilated rooms in tenement buildings. The matter was brought to the attention of the Mayor and the Board
of Aldermen, who passed an ordinance which satisfactorily
solves the problem. Suggestions for the elimination of unlighted rooms in old buildings have been readily acted upon
by several owners thus bettering conditions in their property.

This ordinance also effectually prevents the use of tincovered bay windows projecting over the street line. |

  REPORT OF INSPECTOR OF BUILDINGS,

A later ordinance was passed, allowing the erecting of
three-tenement buildings of wood. few of these buildings
are in the course of construction.

CONCRETE CONSTRUCTION.

Rules for eoncrete construction in buildings are being
framed. Concrete is yet in its experimental stage, and every
precaution is necessary in its use. For this reason none but
experienced persons should be allowed to engage in the manufacture of concrete blocks for use in the walls of buildings.

INDEXING ORDINANCES.

The building ordinances are being indexed and when
completed will greatly aid architects, builders and others
who have oceasion to refer to the various sections

ELEVATORS.

Mr. Barnett, my assistant for the last four months in the

inspection of elevators, has completed the examination of  ,

| which is about two-thirds of the total number, and has found
them to be in satisfactory eondition. Owing to the pressing
demands upon my time it was nevessary to have his assistance
in much of the indexing and routine work of the office. This
arrangement, however, enabled me to devote more time to the
important work of inspections.

An wnusual aeeident occurred in the plunger elevator of
the Senior building; the elevator having dropped when the
lever was thrown for the ascent.

After several experiments discovered that sinilar aceidents are hable to happen at any time to plunger elevators not
equipped with cheek valves in the supply pipes. Assistant
Clnef Moore of the State Pohee has endorsed my views and
will hereafter require check valves to be so placed for all
plunger elevators. This regulation is being complied with in
our elty.

REPORT OF INSPECTOR OF BUILDINGS.  
ELECTRIC WIRING.

The representatives of the New England Insurance Exchange have expressed satisfaction on the high standard of
electrical work done in the city, the National Electrical Code
having been faithfully complied with by the electricians.

The Gas and Electric Department has greatly aided me
in the electric inspection by withholding the installation of
meters until proper permits have been granted.

In eonelusion wish to express my appreciation of the
courtesies extended to me in the performance of my duty by
His Honor, the Mayor, the Board of Aldermen, and the other
city officials.

Respectfully submitted,
T. J. McCARTHY,
Inspector of Buildings.

RECOMMENDATIONS.

The enlargement of the laundry and the building of a
new boiler room has been provided for. While these are much
needed improvements and are much appreciated by the board,
we wish to call attention to other very necessary improvements
which the Institution stands badly in need of. Many of the
corridors and sleeping rooms need new floors; the barn is
much too small and out of repair to successfully care for the
crops of the farm, and for the proper housing of the stock.
There is also much need of silo in connection with the farm.

We respectfully eall attention to these much needed improvements and trust they will be given careful consideration
at the proper time.

Following is detailed statement of expenses at the City
Farm:

Following the usual custom, we have the honor to present herewith our report for the year just closing, together
with detailed report of expenditures and recommendations.
for the coming year.

The season Just passed has been uneventful in that no
new projects have been undertaken, with the exception of the
parapet wall on Prospect Park.

We have added and completed many improvements in
the several parks. Among the most Important is the finishing
of the parapet wall on Prospect Park. This is decided improvement and adds greatly to the appearance of the park.
There remains now to add the eleetric light fixtures and to reerade the embankment on the railroad side, for which we are
to have the co-operation of the Railroad Company. |

Lack of funds has prevented us from carrying out some
projects which we have under consideration, but which we
hope to accomplish the coming year. We have ecomphed with
the new law regarding drinking fountains and have changed
all those in use on the several parks.

We beg to present herewith brief resume of the work
accomplished on the several parks during the vear and their
condition.

  REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS.
ELMWOOD PARK.

The greatest amount of work has been accomplished on
the Bh street extension of this park. Here we have leveled
off the athletic field and covered it with thick coating of
fine loam; we have widened the east portion by filling up on
the dingle side and expect soon to have field second to none
In equipment and size. Here we shall have fine ball field for
baseball and football, tennis court and running track; we
have made plans for their completion early in the spring.

No further work and extensions can be made to this park
until the culvert is extended up to Pine street, work which
should not be delayed another year, for on completion of this
work depends the preparation for putting in the foundation
for the contemplated bridge which is considered necessity
for the convenience of our citizens, and we trust that some
provision will be made for this important work. As soon as
the culvert is built, then, we can prod at once with the extension of the driveway and walks through the most beautiful
portion of the park.

LAUREL STREET TRIANGLE.
This is the new portion that was purchased last year, and
in addition to the small portion already owned by the city.
will make very pretty open spot. We have graded and
seeded it down, and in the spring shall put in the trees,
shrubs, flower beds and walks.
HAMPDEN PARK.

Nothing new has been accomplished here except to Keep
the grounds in their usual high state of efficiency. The subjeets of changing the erade, of introducing system of drainave and building new sidewalks are under eonsideration.

REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS.  
PROSPECT PARK.

For some time past the board has been much dissatisfied
with the general lavout of this park, and have had under consideration the changing over of same, especially since the completion of the wall. We have had our landscape architects
formulate plan which has been submitted to us, and which,
when completed, will much enhance its beauty and usefulness.
The plans call for wide promenade along the entire wall on
the east overlooking the river, and similar one on the west
parallel with the street, fountain in one of the plots, large
coneourse for the public, which will contain band pavilion
for band concerts with generous supply of seats for those
who appreciate the music, large sanitary for both men and
women, to include tool house and work room, complete
playground for both the very young and older children,
which shall include wading pool, sand courts and complete
apparatus for the enjoyment of the children, all to be enclosed in high wire fence for its protection. The parapet
wall will be adorned with artistic electrie hght fixtures,
which will make it very attractive at night. In connection
with the Railroad Company, we are to grade and plant the
banks with shrubs and flowers, which will much enhanee its
beauty and add greatly to the attractiveness of the place on
the approach to the city by travelers.

CANOCHET PARK.

We have made no new addition to this park. Lack of
space will not permit of any further additions. It has been
kept up to the usual high efficiency. There is one thing which
we should hke to recommend, and that is, the placing of eurbing on the streets adjoining the park, and the building of
sidewalks on those streets. This would add much to its attractiveness. .

/
  REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS.
HAMILTON PARK.

It is the opinion of this board that better service could
be derived from this spot by making it into playground for
the children, of which there are many in this thickly settled
district. It is impossible to keep it in satisfactory condition with grass, shrubs and flowers. It could be so arranged
as to afford ample accommodation for those desiring to use
it as resting place, as well as affording plenty of room for
the enjoyment of the children.

GERMANIA PARK. |

We have nothing to report on this park. It has been
well taken eare of and affords breathing spot for many.

| RIVERSIDE PARK.

This is the most important of all our parks, and we have

| ‘continued its development. The past year has seen many inprovements made. Most all of the grading  finished excepting the eenter plot. The Junior ball ground has been

, completed and ready for use the coming season. We have
laid sewer across the park to the river which will take care
of all the water which comes from the springs on the southern
end of the park, and this will enable us to continue development work on this portion.

* The wading pool continues to be source of attraction
and usefulness to the younger generation, and is greatly enjoved by large and increasing numbers, Suitable provision
should be made for dressing rooms for the use of the ehildren. There is loud eall for recreation building for this
portion of the city. one which would provide facilities for
social gatherines, with bath rooms and dress rooms for both
the children using the pool, and these using the athletic field
and out-door evinmasiumn. We strongly reeommend the ereetion of such building and have had plans drawn for such

’

REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS.  D
a structure. It would be of inestimable value in connection
with the playground movement. At the north end of the
wading pool, we have constructed shelter which is much
appreciated by the mothers who bring their children to enjoy the cool water of the pool.
JONES’ POINT.

This beautiful spot has not received any attention from us
toward its development, mainly hause we have not had
the funds at our disposal for such work. Plans are well
completed and we are ready to undertake this work when an
appropriation is made for this purpose. In order to carry out
our present plans, it is reeommended that further purchase
of Jand be made, which would enable us to enlarge the athletie field and playgrounds, and to make more artistic entrance to the park, and to enlarge the concourse, which is
one of the great features of this beautiful spot. If we are
allowed to carry out our plans, we shall present to the citizens of Holvoke most beautiful park for their use and enjoyment.

ALL OTHER PARKS.

The several small areas owned by the city have had care
and attention and are in good condition. Our new possession
ut the junction of Willow and Laurel streets  in pr ss
of development, and we are pleased to announce the acquirement of another small plot by eift from the heirs of Charles
A. Corser, for which gift, we acknowledge with much pleasure and an assuranee of full appreelation. We shall, during the coming season, put this plot in good condition and
open it to the public. Their just share of attention is promised to these small plots during the coming vear. To the
Enyineeringy Department, the Board of Pubhie Works, and
the Water Department, are due our thanks and appreciation
for their assistance and courtesy shown us.

B  REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS.
IN CONCLUSION,

We would most respectfully offer the following suggestions covering the more important items.

Ist. That provision be made for the completion of the
culvert on Elmwood Park up to Pine street, and the erection of the bridge crossing the ravine at this point.

 d. That the contemplated improvements in Prospect
Park be carried out according to plans prepared.

 d. That consideration be given to the projeet of estahlishing reereation building at Riverside Park, believing that
such structure would be greatly appreciated by the people.

 th. The purchase of additional land at Jones’ Point
and the development of this park.

We would recommend that an appropriation be made for
furnishing musie on the several large parks with series ef
band econeerts at frequent intervals.

We continue to advise the further purchase of lands for
eveneral park purposes, while they may be available at reasonable price.

In order to continue the maintenance of our parks in a
proper and efficient manner, and to enable us to continue the

, development work on our new possessions, we would ask
that the following appropriations be made: .
For care and maintenance of all parks, 
For development work on Elmwood) Park, extensien of culvert,  £, 
For development work on Prospect Park,  
For development work on Riverside Park, 
For development work on Jones’ Point.  
For development work on all other parks. —. 
For Reereation Building, Riverside Park. 
For purehase of lands,  

REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS. dot

In reviewing the foregoing, we would ask that due consideration be given our request, that we may be able to pursue the policies above outlined, and that, in view of the fact
that land suitable for park purposes is fast getting to be
unavailable, due to the rapid growth of our city, and that if
our municipality intends to have parks adequate to her population, that the purchase of park lands should not be delayed, and for that reason, we believe that liberal sum
should be placed at our disposal for acquiring such lands
as we may deem necessary and desirable.

We append herewith detailed statement of our receipts and expenditures for the past year, together with an
itemized account of our disbursements, our labor aecount by
months, and cost of all development work and improvements
made on each and all of the parks.

We submit the above report, trusting it will meet with
your approval.

REPORT OF THE
B 
oard of ublic Works
To the Honorable, the Mayor and the Members of the Board
of Aldermen of the City of Holyoke, Mass.

GENTLEMEN :—We beg to submit. for your consideration
the report of this Board covering the fiseal vear ending November and to commend to your attention the statisties of the various departments hereunto annexed. These
tables show in detail all of the work that has been accomplished during the year, which has been one of progress, We
believe we can safely say that the condition of the city’s interests coming within the jurisdiction of this Board, have
been well conserved, and that today healthy growth appears.

For the financial statement of departments under the
Board there is table entitled ‘Department Accounts,”’
showing the balances brought forward from  the original appropriations from taxation, transfers from other departinents; the total appropriations to departments by loans;
the receipts, the amounts paid or refunded to departments
for work done for other departments; the total maintenance
and construction eost and the balances carried forward to
 .

A new school building has been started to replace the
North Chestnut street building, and it is hoped that this
structure—the Wilham Whiting School-—ean be placed at
the disposal of the school committee, so that the spring term
of school in ean be opened therein. Wluile the building
was not started until nearly July,  vet better progress
has heen made towards its completion than has appertained

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.  
to almost any other school building that has been erected during the life of the Board. The total cost of this building, ineluding regrading the grounds and the furniture, will not be
far from sixty-three thousand dollars ($ ), divided
as follows, viz.:—For the general contract. and extras awarded
to date to Louis Carreau Son, forty-nine thousand, six hundred and sixty dollars and seventy-three cents ($ ;
for the heating and ventilating contract and extras awarded
to the Holyoke Supply Company, three thousand, nine hundred and twenty-nine dollars ($ ), and for the plumbing and sanitary contract given to Sullivan Carmody,
three thousand, four hundred and one dollars ($ for
lighting fixtures installed by Charles Hall, five hundred and
fifty-three dollars and fifty cents ($ ). The total appropriation granted by the Board of Aldermen for this building
and its furnishings was sixty-three thousand, two hundred
and seventy-five dollars ).

This is the first school building to be erected by the city
of Holyoke with the plan of its future use jointly for day and
evening schools and eivie purposes. There have been provided
hot and cold baths both for the boys and girls and to these
baths are connected showers. It  the hope of the Board that
within short time after the opening of this building, its use
by the adults out of school hours will be as vreat as its uses
by the children during school sessions. The building is ideally
located for use by the citizens, outside of purely educational

- work, and its equipment cannot but be of material benefit to
the entire city as well as to the immediate seetion that it
serves.

The Ingleside school biulding, started, last vear,  practieally completed, so much so, that probably before New Year’s
the school will be moved from the old building.

There is considerable grading yet to be done, which prohably will not be finished before early in the coming spring.
The contracts for the building are divided thus: Lynch
Brothers Brick Company, general contraetors, contraet and

‘
.  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.
extras (twenty-four thousand, two hundred and sixty-seven
dollars and sixty cents ($ ); heating and ventilating, P. J. Donnelly, two thousand, four hundred and ninety, seven dollars ($ ); plumbing contract, Sullivan &
Carmody, nine hundred and thirteen dollars and forty-seven
cents ($ ), making total contracted cost of the building of twenty-seven thousand, six hundred and  seventyeight dollars and seven cents ($ ). For the general]
expense aside from the eontraets, we would refer vou to the
tables hereunto annexed.

All of the school buildings have had the usual amount of
repairs, and work is now in progress in the last three buildings, to be equipped with automatic fire alarms, ringing directly from the city lighting eurrent, viz. the E]mwood,
Highland and Kirtland schools. All of these buildings have
had fire alarm systems, energy for which has been obtained
from batteries. Principals and scholars have been trained to
the sound of these gongs, and the particular tone of the bells
prevails in all buildings, so that seholars moving from one
section of the city to another immediately recognize the fire
alarin signal whenever it  sounded regardless of the length
of time they may have been in attendance in any particular
building.

The Board has been particularly and extremely careful
in installing these alarms when coming in contact with other
bells that no signal system in any building shall in any wav
resemble the sound or note of the fire bell. The switehes con- trolling these systems are convemently Iceated in the eorridors, in the boiler rooms or jamitors” rooms, and also in the
principal's offices; the arrangement of the switches being such,
that when the alarm is once started ringine it cannot be
stopped except by throwing off the particular switch that
started it, and the alarm will sound eontinuously so long as the
hichting current remains in the buildine.

Aside from the High Street Engine Tfouse only the regular routine work necessary for maintenance has been done on

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS. ofa
the fire department buildings. In the High street house
practically the entire first floor has been reconstructed. Owing to the installation of the automobile apparatus, the floors
have been constructed mostly of conerete, which practically
insures safety from fire.

Contracts will be let early in the coming year for renovating and renewing the finish in the Relief Engine house and
the City Hall building. For maintenance cost and the expense of new work in public buildings, we refer you to the recapitulation cost sheet, which shows an approximate expenditure for new work and maintenance of one hundred and ’
eighteen thousand, seven hundred and. seventeen  dollars
($ ).

Plans are now being prepared for Contagious Disease
Hospital and for Tubereulesis Camp. It is the plan to finish and eqmp the camp before the hospital is ereeted. The
location of the camp has been selected by the Board of Health
on the northerly slope of the land purchased in for the
Contagious Disease Ilospital, the camp being sheltered from
the hot, suffocating southerly breezes of the summer, and well
bevond the vision of the inmates and attendants at the Contagious Disease Hospital. The camp will ecst in the vicinity
of ten thousand dollars ($ ), when completed. This
amount will inelude the sewer and water connections,

Plans are now in preparation for construetine mueh
needed enlargement to the steam plant at the Citw Farm. and
also for enlarging the laundry. The rapid inerease in the
mumber of inmates at this institution has severely taxed the
existing steam plant, which furnishes steam not) only for
warning the building, but for operating many kitehen utensils and for generating eleetrie current for livht.

During the early part of the vear the gas engine used for
generating current at the Highland school building exploded,
wreaking the machine but fortunately doing no other damage.
This plant was installed when the building was erected, owing
to the inability of the city to contract with the Tlolvoke Water

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.
Power Company, which then owned the Electric plant, for
current to operate the ventilating machinery. The change
from the energy generated by the gas engine to energy to be
. delivered at the building by the Gas and Electric Department
had been many times considered before this explosion, but
owing to the hmited amount of energy to be had at pressure of five hundred volts necessitating complete
change in all motors, the Board had never deemed it wise to
contract this expense. With the gas engine demolished, it becaine necessary to install alternating current motors in place
of the five hundred volt direct current apparatus, and
make other changes in the ventilating plant, this expense being borne by the City Property Department, the approximate
eost of which was five hundred and eight dollars and ninetyeight cents ($ ).

At the West Street School, it has been necessary to add
two new class rooms, and for this temporary use the hall in
this building has been devoted. Concrete walks and driveways have been econstrueted in the rear of the building,

abutting the new playground, and an iron fencing of orna
mental design has been ereeted on the West street side.

The most important work outside of that performed in
the public buildings has been in the Outdoor Department.

The Board feels justified in saying that probably no eity
of our size has streets in as good condition as the streets of
Holvoke regardless of the expense of construction or maintenanee and further that the construction and  maintenace
eost of our streets is maternally lower than the cost in other
cities. As has been previously stated, Holyoke  particularly
fortunate In this respect. The Board has been able to make
some very excellent contraets, so far as street work pertains.
so much so, in fact, that visiting delegation from another
eity refused to believe that so favorable terms could be had
for street work under contract, as Holvoke had made, until the
actual contraet was produced for its inspection. The Department and the city at large are indebted to vreat extent—

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS. ,
probably to greater extent than the average citizen realizes. .
—to the Gas and Electric Department for the condition of
our streets at the present time. All of the tar, both coal tar and
water gas tar, used for street work during the year has
been given to the city without charge by the Gas and Elec- :
tric Department, except such amounts of coal tar as were
used in the construction of new and the repair of old sidewalks where only nominal charge of one dollar ($ was
made. The expense of the new sidewalk work is borne Jointly
by the abutting property owners and by the city. .
The benefit that Holyoke has thus derived  attested by
the resurfacing of Northampton street from the old HolyokeNorthampton line to the Springfield Road, making the street
. practically dustless, and one continuous shect of smooth, ,
even roadway fully appreciated by automobilists. The Springfield Road has been resurfaced -from the West Springfield ,
line to the New York, New Haven and Hartford railroad |
bridge at South street, with the same material. The state
highway from Kenilworth Castle north to Smith’s Ferry has .
been covered with tar, the state having agreed to pay the ex- |
pense of the labor, and the gas and electric department. donating the tar. Maple street between Suffolk and Hampden .
streets and Suffolk street from Chestnut street to Walnut street have been resurfaced. Maple street from Cabot street
to Sargeant street and South street from Brown avenue to ,
Northampton street, also Brown avenue from South street to |
Laurel street, Mosher street and East Dwight street have |
been treated in some locations. Water gas tar for dust laying purposes was applied to Dwight street between School  
street and O’Connor avenue after the new roadway was con- |
structed in August. Many streets on the Highlands and in
Elmwood were also treated with this material so that the
yardage of streets covered without charge for the bitulithie |
materials furnished by the Gas and Electric Department aggregates into the hundreds of thousands. The average citizen will be much surprised should he make eareful study

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.

of the benefits and advantages that not only the travelling
public, but the residents along these streets, have acquired by
the use of this material.

A departure in the laying of dust in this city was made
during the year. Practically twenty-six thousand )
gallons of dustoline and thirty-eight thousand gallons of emulsifying oil have been used at total cost of seventeen hundred dollars ($ ), for the dustoline and two
thousand one hundred and seventy-two dollars ($ )
for the oil. The dustoline has been principally apphed on the
maecadam and hard graveled streets in Wards One, Two and
Four, while the emulsifying oil was applied on dirt streets in
various sections of the city in practfeally the same manner as
water is apphed from street sprinkler. The average cost
per yard for the dustoline was one cent and six-tenths mills
($ while the average cost. for the oil was two and onehalf mills per square vard. The dustoline was applied without diluting, while the emulsifying oil was mixed with
water in the ratio of one hundred and fifty gallons of
oil to four hundrel and fifty gallons of water. The
Custoline is, we believe, more of crude petroleum product
designed to hold the wearing surface of the roadway in com- |
pact mass and to prevent disintegration, while at the same
time it is satisfactory and effective dust laver. The emulsifving oil aets more as dust laver than it does as preservative of the wearing surface of the roadway, it being necessary to reapply the preparation practically each twenty-one
( days, while the dustoline need not be applied to good
hard surfaees more than two or three tines season. When
dustoline was first apphed there was some objection from residents alone the streets, that the material tracked into houses,
but the benefits gained in laving the dust more than offset
the discomforts caused by the tracking up of the substance.

A tar-holding tank has been constructed at the works of
the Gas and Electrie Department, its capacity being about six
thousand gallons, the tank being so constructed that

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.  
the tar can be heated to any temperature desired. The Board
has also equipped this department with two tar spraying apparatuses for applying the hot tar to the strects.

Permanent improvements have been made on Commercial street from Sargeant street to Jackson street, where a
macadam roadway was constructed during the summer.
Dwight street has been improved from School] street to Pleasant street, that portion lving between O’Connor avenue and :
School street being covered with water gas tar to lay the dust,
as before stated, while the part lying between O’Connor avenue and Pleasant street has been treated with pitch and coal
tar. )

A new roadway was constructed on Northainpton street
from the old Holyoke-Northampton line as far north as the
state Mighwav at Kemilworth. This work was done in onjunction with the Street Railway Company at the time that
this company refaved its tracks in this location, the company
having agreed to bear its pro rata share of the expense. This
stretch of roadway well ilustrates the faet that streets of
this nature ean be much more satisfactory eonstrueted for
the benefit of the entire public by the hearty co-operation of
municipal and street railway interests.

Elm street from Dwieht street to Sargeant street has
been improved by the construction of tar maeadam roadway, this being one of the streets for which tar was furnished
Without charge by the Gas and Electric Department.

"Pine street. from Prospect street to Hampshire street,
Dwight street. from Maple street to Elin street: and Mosher
street from Bridve street to Canal street were resurfaced with
trap rock and standard asphalt macadam binder.

The eost of this work is shown under the itemized expenditures in the Highways and Permanent ilighways Departments.

If this same line of work ean be continued, it will not be
long before all of the streets in the business and residential

‘

sections of the city have received wearing surface more or
less permanent und in all ways satisfactory.

The Board has continued its policy of erecting street
signs, but the work this year has been delayed on account of
the fixtures which had to be of special design to fit the posts
already set.

The usual demand has been made upon the Board for
curbing, and sidewalks, and we have been unable to grant all
of the petitions owing to the limited appropriations, and much
work remains to be done the coming season.

The first installation of Tungsten street hehts was made
last summer on Taylor street between Hampden street, and
its northerly end, and on Longwood avenue west from Northampton street. Work is now in progress in changing the are
lighting system on Northampton street between the Spring| field Road and Clark street to Tungsten lights, it being the
opinion of the Board that much more satisfactorily lehted
street can be had in residential sections by the use of Tungsten
lights as the units are placed much nearer to one another than
It is advisable to plaee the are hehts, the cost. of the two systems as installed being the same.

The Ingleside Underpass, work on whieh was begun in
 was completed early in the year, making safe roadway at this point.

The lst of sewers construeted is shown on the table annexed hereto, tegether with the total eost of each sewer and
the average cost per foot.

The Plaveronnd Commission has already filed with the
Mayor report covering its work during the current year,
but the expenditures in this department, both for new work
and maintenanee, are shown in the tables annexed hereto.

The continued steady growth of the city in point of popWation, with the new area that was added to us last year, toevether with the increased requests and the growing demands
for better sidewalks, extensions of eurbing and new walks.
the repair of existing streets, and the construction of new

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.  
roadways, together with the general desire for better and increased street tighting, all tax the appropriations of the
Board to the utmost. If the petitions and requests are to be
granted, it will not be possible for the Board to conduct the |
departments under its control for less amount of money
than we have had the past year. It is much more probable
that increased appropriations must be asked for in nearly all
of the departments under the Board.

To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen of the a
City of Holyoke: .
GENTLEMEN :—In compliance with the Public Statutes, Fs
the Board of Health herewith respectfully submit for your  .
consideration the thirtieth annual report.
ORGANIZATION. The Board met for organizaticn the first Monday im February,  electing the following officers: Arthur B.
Wetherell, M.D... Chaimman: Frank A. Woods, M. D.. Seeretary.
PUBLIC HEALTH. During the vear ending November the Board :
has endeavered to extend the work of this department in all
of its various lines. The eonstantly inereasing mumber of :
complaints and petitiens add greatly to the work of the Board, .
rejuiring as they do in large majority of cases, Inspection of
the premises invelved., ;
This means eerresponding increase in the amount of
work by the members of the Board.  
GENERAL WORK.
The general work of keeping the city clean requires .
much more time, care and attention by the members of the
Board than is evident toe any one who does not take especial |
interest in the work and thus look into the subject.

  KEPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.

Much cf this werk hes in abating small nuisances which
eifect culy the loealities in whieh they exist. Dirty cellars,
tenements, stores and other buildings come under this head
and upon this work, many times, depends the health of the
locality. This tenement work not only tends to directly decrease the mortality but is great aid in the prevention of

'  epidemies. If each property owner would see to it that his
tenements and their surroundings are kept in clean condition, it would greatly aid this Board in this very important
work.

The Board wish to again recommend that house to
house inspection of plumbing be made. That there is still
mueh plumbing within the city which needs the attention of
the Board is evident, but it is impossible for this Board
with its present foree to make this desired inspection.

It is recommended that special appropriation be made
for this work and that at least part of the work be done during the coming year.

BAKERIES.

) Such yearly inspections of the bakeries and their surroundings as is preseribed by law have been made. Taken as
a whole, these important places where so much of our food
products ave manufactured, have been found in good eondtion. number of minor changes have been suggested and
their enforcement will be earefully attended to. There are
at present twenty-nine bakeries within the city.

BARBER SHOPS.

The barber shops have been inspected and rules and regulations have been posted in each shop. There are at present
sixty-two barber shops in the city.

UNDERTARERS.

Under the provisions of Section  Chapter  of the
Revised Laws. fourteen persons have been duly licensed as

undertakers.

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
SLAUGHTER HOUSES.
All slaughter houses and manufacturers of sausage and
prepared meat within the city are now granted licenses by
this Board.
The supervision of the places of business of those thus
engaged has caused an improvement in the character of articles furnished to the public for consumption.
The Inspector of Meat and Provisions is in full co-operation with the Board, and as result, there is less diseased
meat offered for sale.
CONTAGIOUS DISEASE HOSPITAL. |
The Board would again eall attention to the need of ,
hospital for the isolation and eare of diseases of conta- |
gious nature, especially diphtheria and searlet fever. The }
value of such an institution is being realized more and more ,
each vear, and many cities of the state have such hospitals
which greatly aid in the control of epidemies of these dis- |
cases. ,
BARNS AND LIVERY STABLES.
, All appheations for the erection or use of buildings as
barns or livery stables have received careful attention, and
the sites of their location have been inspected. Licenses for
the construction and use of sueh have been granted with a
few exceptions. People are becoming more familiar with this
law and there is less tendeney of the evasion of same.
LOCK-UP.
The Board inust again eall attention to the loek-up.
Some other place than the present quarters should be provided at once for the accommodation of the Pohee Department. The present quarters are not only too small but are
unsuited for their present use. The Board would recommend
that seme action be imuediately taken toward remedying
this inatter. The loek-up demands immediate attention, This

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.

room is necesisty, and the present one is unfit for human

oeccupaney. Some system of ventilation should be established.
MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS.

Medical inspection of schools is one of the most important branches of the. health department, the purpose of
which is to protect healthy children from diseased and  infected children, by examinatiun, isolation and calling attention to the Board of Health, and the parents to defective and
diseased children that medical attention may be secured, and
thereby aid in assisting toward the development of sound
mind in healthy body, which is the first essential for an
education.

With the appointment of school physicians only part of
the real work of medical inspection of schools has been accomphshed. There should be some one to see that the instructions of the inspectors are carried out, some one with
technical knowledge to instruct the parents as to the care of
the eves and ears, and the necessity of the care of the skin.

The appointment of school nurse is recommended.

TUBERCULOSIS.

The widespread prevalence of this” fatal disease has
aroused almost universal concerted action on the part of health
officials, the medical profession and the humanitarians. to
prevent its ravages and to care for its victims. The trouble
lies in the fact that the public is used to having this disease
in its midst, it is gradual in its onset, it does not cause death
in few days or weeks, and it is difficult to prove to an individual when he has contracted: the disease.

Prevention is the great) problem in’ considering this
disease. If the people can be brought to realize that there are
eonditions to be observed and earried out by the tubercular
patient that will make his condition more bearable and safeeuard his friends. we shall then begin to see results. There
is no one Who can bring this knowledge home to the patient

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
afflicted with tuberculosis with so much force and conviction as
the family physician. We look forward, therefore, to the profession with much confidence, not only in its ability, but its
desire to prevent the further spread of this disease.

The members of the Board of Health wish to express
their sincere thanks to His Honor, the Mayor, and the Board

‘
Report of Bacteriologist.
To the Holyoke Board of Health:

GENTLEMEN :—I herewith present my report on the eases
subrnitted to me for laboratory examination during the year
ending November :

| During the year there have been fewer cases of diphtheria than for several years past, there having been but positive eases examined in the laboratory. The real worth of
this department, however, is demonstated by the fact that
there were swabs examined which were found to be negative. This is due to the fact, as stated in previous reports,
that the physicians are daily realizing more and more the
value of microscopic examination in eliminating the diagnosis of diphtheria, as well as in confirming it. In order to
show this let me quote from my two previous reports:  
showed positive and negative diagnosis; 
positive and negative, while the present year shows  
positive and  negative. These figures speak for theimselves.

I would again call the attention of the physicians to the
fact that in eases which are clinically suspicious, single negative examimation should never be accepted as conclusive, beeause it not infrequently happens that seeond swab will
show positive growth where the first was negative. Also
that all cases of membranous eroup must be reported regardless of the laboratory findings.

The placing of box in the High Street entrance of the
City Hall during the past vear has proved to be deeided advantave to the physicians who may now deposit swabs here
at all times up to nine ocloek at night, thus doing away with
the more or less compleated system in vere up to this time.

.
  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
TUBERCULOSIS.

The total number of sputum examinations for tuberele
bacilli made during the past year was  of which were
positive and negative. This branch of our work is growing
from year to year only it is to be regretted that the physicians
do not take advantage of this opportunity for free examinations to greater extent than they do at present, because we
all know that microscopie examination of the sputum is
often of great value in making our diagnosis. At times, of
course, an undoubtedly positive case may have negative report returned from the laboratory, but every year attention is
called to the fact that this is liable to occur, and that sinvle negative report should never be accepted as final in suspicious eases. On the other hand were specimens handed in as
a routine in every case where there is protracted cough there
would undoubtedly be not few positive reports that would
be unexpected, and in this way proper treatment could be instituted in the early stages where the patient  more likely to
derive permanent benefit.

TYPHOID.

Our aty is particularly fortunate imasmuch as we have
so few cases of true typhoid fever. This belicve to be duc
to the exeellent eonditions governing our water and milk supply and drainage systems. Our water system is acknowledged
to be one of the best in this country, and the dairies and other
sources of our milk supply are inspected regularly, and if
conditions prevailing are not up to the proper standard, it is
insisted upen that the ssary hmprovements be made at
onee. Of course every year finds number of eases reported,
but in many of these we have no opportunity to make an exanination, would suggest that vour Board request blood
specimen for Widal examination in every case reported as
typhoid. |

During the past year but fifteen Widal examinations
were taade, one of which was positive and fourteen negative.

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH. |
OPTHALMIA NEONOTORUM.
I would again suggest that your Board insist that smear a
be handed in for examination in all cases where there is a
purulent eve discharge in the newborn. If you see fit to pass
upon this, will furnish outfits, and should our work be the oo,
means of saving but one pair of eyes year, we would be
amply compensated for the trouble and expense involved.  
I wish to thank your Board and its attaches for their hearty co-operation, and the physicians for the kindness and 
courtesy shown me. ee
Appended you will find detailed report of the work for me
the year. Respectfully submitted, |
