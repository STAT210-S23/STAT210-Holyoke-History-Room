REPORT OF THE
BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
To the Honorable, the Mayor and members of the Board
of Aldermen of the City of Holyoke, Mass.
Gentlemen :—

The Board submits herewith its annual report for the
vear ending November and in the tables presented
vou will find the work of the Department outlined in detail.

The year just closed has not been one of marked ac- 
tivity and no loans or appropriations for new or permanent
work were made during the year so that the only  permanent work that could be aeceomplished was necessarily
done from balances brought forward into the current year
from  While one hundred and fifty-eight thousand
seventy-one dollars and nine cents ($ was
brought forward from  the sum of fiftv-nine thousand
seven hundred thirteen dollars and forty-three cents ($  being earried forward in balances in these same
departments to the year  but greater part of these
balances remains to be paid for liabilities contracted prior
to but work not performed December .

The amount of eighteen thousand eighty dollars.
($ brought forward to this report year in the aceount of Central Fire Station was expended by the Fire
Department in the installation of the new fire alarm telegraph system, in which this Board had no part.

Contracts have been awarded and work is now well
under way for the construction of the Isolation Hospital, |
it being hoped that the building vrill be finished by the first

 () REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS

of February next with the exception of the improvement
of the grounds and furnishings, for which it will be necessary to make additional appropriations. The expenditures
this vear were forty-two thousand six hundred forty-four
dollars and fifty-four cents ($ ). There are uncompleted contracts and liabilities amounting to twenty-eight
thousand one hundred fifty-eight dollars and thirty-nine
eents ($ ).

It is hoped that the pressure on the street mains from
the High Service reservoir and the Whiting Street reservoir
will be sufficient to care for this building, but if this pressure proves inadequate arrangements must be made to obtain the supply through the pumping station now supplying the Tuberculosis Hospital. Unless there should be unforeseen and unexpected delays in obtaining the furnishings

 and equipment for the building the structure should be
ready for ocecupaney and use early the coming summer.

The addition of the Isolation Hospital buildings to the
Fuel department will increase the expenditures quite materially, provided this building is used throughout the entire year. It will be well, if possible, to provide sufficient
appropriation in the fuel department so that all coal needed
for the winter of  could be purchased during the
summer of  The buildings consume about four thousand six hundred fifty tons of anthracite coal and
seven hundred fifty tons of bituminous coal per year
at the present time. There is difficulty in getting coal and
some of our buildings at the present time are running on
a small margin although no actual shortage has occurred up’
to the present writing. However, the utmost economy in the
use of coal during the coming winter should be practiced
by all persons having to do with the burning of same, and
wherever possible heat should be conserved and fuel saved.

The Board desires to call attention to its reeommendations made in former years concerning the care and repair of the bridges of the city. It is the opinion of the

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
Board that the time has come when some provisions must
be made to care for and repair to such extent as may be
necessary the two bridges crossing the Connecticut river
and the iron bridges over the canals. Your attention is invited to the report of the Board in in the matter and
especially to the recommendation as follows:

‘‘A thorough examination should be given to

all the canal bridges and the recommendations as
to repairs derived from such examination should .
be followed. While no accidents have occurred
there is no reason to suppose that Holyoke will be
more fortunate than any other place in this matter
and the time must come when the law of averages
will prevail unless something is done to maintain
these structures and to prevent the rapid deterioration now  progress.’’

Very few, if any, of the existing canal bridges were
designed to carry the loads that they are required to carry
at the present time. As was reported last vear, the second
level canal bridge on Cabot street and the seeond level canal
bridge on Bridge street (the latter being known as  the
‘‘Valley’’ bridge), were reported adversely by the engineers
of the Public Service Commission and the bridge on Cabot
street second level canal was closed to street car traffic.

The bridges on Lyman street, Cabot street. Sargeant
street and Appleton street, were constructed many years
ago and it is the opinion of the Board that sum of not
less than ten thousand dollars ($ should be specifically appropriated the coming year to provide for thorough examination, cleaning, repairing and painting of the
bridges so far as this amount will go.

Something should be done the coming year and if not
the coming vear must be done within short time to place
the first level canal bridge on Appleton street in condition
to meet all of its unusual requirements, heavy loading of

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS

- this bridge being caused at times by the blocking of the
Appleton street crossing of the New York, New Haven and
Hartford Railroad Company. It might be well to provide
by ordinance or order against heavy standing loads on the
bridge during such time as the crossing is obstructed for
travel.

While the Boardadoes not care to cause undue alarm
or to appear panicky in this matter, it invites your most
serious consideration and study of the present problem of —

“bridge construction and maintenance.

The total appropriation and receipts in the Highway
Department amounted to sixty-five thousand one hundred
twenty dollars and seventy-three cents ($ and
the total expenditures for maintenance and construction,
sixty-four thousand three hundred seventy dollars and sixteen cents ($ ). The original appropriation was
fifty-six thousand dollars ($ ), to which was added
the excise and corporation tax, credited to this department
under the laws of the state, which together with some minor

receipts, brought the total credits to the above amount.

It is generally assumed that this amount is for the repair of the highways and bridges, and, while this is to a
greater or less extent true, there is considerable expense
which the City must pay and which has been paid from the
appropriation in this department and shows very little in
the general condition of the surface of the roadways of our
streets.

The amount expended in the Highway Department for
Accidents and illness, was ...................

streetS  ...   cc        es§  
Repairs to country roads .................+.-  
Miscellaneous repairs to streets caused by heavy

rains of last summer .............. 

Of the above amounts it will be seen from the first
three items that the sum of five thousand nine hundred
eighty-eight dollars ($ ), is in no way connected with
the upkeep of the streets. The charge for snow removal
and the cleaning of the streets, necessary for the ordinary
convenience of the public, and the care of the streets, are
expensive items and do not in any way improve or remove
the defects or depressions of the wearing surfaces of the
roadways.

It would appear to the Board that in order to have a
clearer understanding of the amount that is expended for’ ::
the actual repair work, expenses similar to the above could
well be provided for in separate appropriation.

Little work of permanent nature was done during the
year, the improving and widening of Northampton
street between Lincoln and Morgan streets and the com| pletion of the widening of the intersection of Dwight and
Northampton streets, together with the finishing of small
portion of the City Hall Court between High street and
Railroad street, finishing the Dwight street footbridge,
being the principal work accomplished in the Permanent
Highway department. |
- No appropriations were made for permanent sidewalk
work or permanent sewer work and the appropriation for .
highway maintenance was insufficient to accomplish much
necessary work. If the highways of the city are to be im, REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
proved and maintained in thoroughly satisfactory manner sufficient amount of money to meet these requirements must be provided. This has not been the case in the
past few vears. |

In the sidewalk department the expense for

Accidents, amounted to ............. . 
Removal of snow, sanding walks and operation

Of plowS  ...    ee     re  
Vacations of laborers in this department ....  
Construction of cinder walks .................  

. The appropriations for sidewalk repairs and maintenance for the past few vears have been insufficient to meet
the demands made upon the department. The appropria- |
tions for this work must also be increased if satisfactory
naintenancve work is to be done. With each sucding
vear, with appropriations limited to the barest needs, the
streets and sidewalks cannot be kept in condition of former
vears and the defects are increasing rapidly. The Board
hopes that some means may be provided for placing the
sidewalks and roadways of streets in generally acceptable
eondition and this work with the increase in cost of labor
and materials will necessitate larger appropriations.

It is hoped that something can be done to improve the
paving at the intersection of Main and Dwight streets and
also on Main street between Dwight and .Appleton streets
and at the northerly and southerly sections of High street.
and in sections of High street between Appleton and Dwight
streets.

In the alley department the accident expense

amounted tO ....        
Vacations

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
was expended exclusive of the maintenance and purehase
of new carts and implements.

The culvert in Elmwood Park has been extended to a
point easterly of High street and connected with the eculvert under the tracks of the Holvoke and Westfield Railroad thus providing for increased accommodations for the

dumping of alley refuse. The space thus provided will meet
the requirements of this department for but short time.
The Board hopes that during the coming year an appropria.

; tion suffivient to construct an extension of the culvert between Bh and Pine streets in Elmwood Park will be provided, the fill having reached the end of the existing culvert at this point and very little additional filling can be
done until the culvert is extended.

New contracts for the collection of garbage were made
during the vear at an annual cost of eleven thousand one

hundred sixty dollars ($ ), being an increase of twelve
hundred and eighty-four dollars (# over the econ- .
tracts existing the two previous vears. The contracts made
this year will expire May .

The salaries in the City Hall Annex and Police
Building will amount next year to approximately oo...           
A total for for salaries of approximately  
For the City Hall Comfort Station the up-keep
amounted tO .......   ec     neces  
and in the City Hall Annex and Police Building  
in addition to the amounts paid for salaries for janitors and
caretakers. These salaries and expenses have been paid
from the City Property appropriation and it would seem
wise to the Board that there be established separate appropriation for their care and maintenance.

The Board recommends that the property of the Holyoke Water Power Company on Commercial street be  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS

tween the present City Yard building and Sargeant street
be purchased for an addition to the City Yard. The property is now used jointly by the Playground Commission
for bath house and in part by the Board for the storage
of materials used in the Outdoor Department, only nominal rental, aside from the taxes, being paid therefore to the
Holyoke Water Power Company. It might be advisable,
if possible, to purchase additional land on the east side of
the railroad tracks and between the tracks and the first
level canal to be used in connection with the Yard.

The purchase of machinery for carrying on the work
of the Department is recommended. The prevailing searecity of labor is serious problem and the use of labor saving
machinery should be seriously considered. The use of machinery for the cleaning of catch basins and the sweeping and cleaning of streets has been found to be successful
in other cities and has enabled the work to be performed
at reduced cost.

The Board is at present meking survey of the various departments with an idea of ascertaining as near as
may be possible the additional expense over in each
eaused by the increase in wages to be paid the men by :
reason of the new scale, effective December A
rough estimate of these amounts would appear to be ap; proximately as follows:

REPORT OF THE
Sinking Fund Commissioners
To His Honor the Mayor and the Board of Aldermen of the

City of Holyoke, Mass:

The Commissioners of the Sinking Fund for the payment of Municipal Bonds, respectfully submit the following ,
report.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT
Amount of fund November  th, 
February  st,  received from

City Treasurer ................ 

Interest on balances to March 
$ 

Disbursements:

March  (School Bonds ................$ 

As it will be seen by this report, on March  st,  ,
with the final payment of  (School Bonds) theré
went out of existence automatically the Sinking Fund Commission for the payment of Municipal Bonds.

Established in when the City of Holyoke was  ”
eorporated, it has continued in force until the above men:
tioned date. During the second Mayoralty of A. B. Chap!)
in  the method of payment of the City debt was changed to the serial bond system under the control of the City
Treasurer.

Only the payment of those Municipal Bonds then  ?

 i.

REPORT OF SINKING FUND COMMISSIONERS  
the market was left to the Commissioners and the last of
those were paid on March Ist,  .

During the years of its existence four men only
were honored by being its Treasurer, James E. Delaney
( George W. Prentiss ); C. F. Smith
( ), and S. A. Mahoney ). While there
are many faults and temptations inherent in the payment
of municipal indebtedness by the Sinking Fund method,
no system could have turned out more satisfactory or aceurately than did that of Holvoke’s. It is mute tribute

to the integrity of the loeal banking fraternity into whose
 hands was intrusted the manipulation of the funds for  
out of the years of its existence. On March Ist,  ,
the books were closed by the Commissioners and the accounts accurately balanced.

Respectfully submitted, ‘
HARRY J. BARDWELL,
JOHN J. FINN,
S. A. MAHONEY,
Commissioners of the Sinking Fund
for the payment of Municipal Bonds.

Report of the City Auditor
To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen
Gentlemen :—

I present herewith the annual statement of the receipts
and expenditures for the fiscal year  in the form and
manner required by the State of Massachusetts.

I have audited the accounts of the City Clerk, the Milk
Inspector, the Water Department and the Gas and Electric
Department, found them correct, the receipts properly re
corded and promptly deposited, and the expenditures ap
proved in due form. The Tax Collector’s books and entries
have been audited so far as possible. The postings here
reach the thousands and as each is separately checked, it
takes quite while to complete his accounts. The report
also contains detailed report of the expenditures in the
Contingent Unclassified, War Expenditures and Salaries
accounts, City Indebtedness, Sinking Funds and Tax Collector’s Exhibit, the bonds issued during the year with the
purpose for which they were issued, the cash on hand, the
borrowing capacity and comparative debt statement for a
period of years.

The only bonds issued this year were  for the
Water Department to be used for the construction of the
Fomer reservoir. As this work was completed considera.
bly below the estimated cost.  of the loan was returned, or enough to meet the first year’s bond payment.

Payments on the City Debt and to the Sinking Fund
during the vear totalled  as follows: City debt serial
bonds, City debt long term bonds, Gas

  REPORT OF CITY AUDITOR

and Electrie plant debt, Water debt, Holyoke and Westfield R. R. debt, Payment to City
Sinking Fund,  and accumulations, Payments
to Water debt,  and accumulations, Excess
of payments over loans, .

The last of the long term bonds, City debt proper, were
paid this year. In the future, all debt must be issued in serial form and payments made annually in accordance with
the State law. Sinking Funds which now exist expire with
the payment of the debt for which they provide, such as the
Water department, which has outstanding long term bonis

maturing in for  and in for to
meet which the department has Sinking Fund at present
of  which fully meets the requirements.

The total net debt all sources is  as against
$  last vear, decrease in the net debt of This does not include the outstanding temporary

| loans which this year are  as against  year
aro. |

The borrowing capacity is  as against 
last vear.

Respectfully submitted,
' DANIEL W. KENNEY,
City Auditor.
