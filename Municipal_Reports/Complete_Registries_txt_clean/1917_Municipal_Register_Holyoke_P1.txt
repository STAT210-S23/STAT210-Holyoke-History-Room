MAYOR’S ADDRESS
]
Gentlemen of the Board of Aldermen:

Today we enter upon the forty-fourth year of our
municipal administration. We assume obligations and responsibilities which weigh heavily upon each and all of us,
and which we should undertake and perform with all the :
zeal and fidelity and all the intelligence of which we are
capable.

The people demand of us the maximum of caution, pru‘dence and vigilance.

The most conservative care must be taken with regard
to the rights of taxpayers, that the burdens of expenditure
shall not rest too heavily upon property interests.

Our greatest and our highest endeavors should be to
bring about the progress demanded by the whole people— |
but within the limits of true economy and sound finance.

It would seem to the observant person, judging by the
extravagant demands of certain officials, and the moneyspending suggestions of certain boards, that the sinister
influence of invisible government is still lurking in some of
the offices of the City Hall, and that demands, hitherto dormant, are now brought to life in an attempt to befuddle the.
public mind and belittle the new administration. Too much
attention should not be paid to reports of officials and
boards when doctored for their own especial benefit, so
that the public may be deceived into thinking that all is
well. We should not rest content that Holvoke’s best interests are properly cared for until every vestige of invisible government is swept from the City Hall and men placed
in office who will know no boss but honor and serve only
God and the people of Holyoke.

|
  MAYOR'S ADDRESS 
Holyoke needs officials with eyes looking to the public |
good and not glued to the pay-window.
FINANCES
The total net debt, all sources, is The
borrowing capacity at the close of the fiscal year was The outstanding temporary loans this year are  as against  year ago.
FIRE DEPARTMENT
The efficiency of the rank and file of this department
has always been commendable.
: The petition of the firemen for two-platoon system
merits serious consideration and should be granted as soon
as practical method can be found. referendum to the
voters might be the most satisfactory solution of this vital
matter.
BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS—STREETS AND |
SIDEWALKS :
There has been too much makeshift and patchwork
roadways and very little permanent paving for travelled
streets during the past few years; in fact the conditions of
the streets and sidewalks have been disgrace—deplorable
; and inexcusable. The best macadam road for residential
streets, and permanent paving for the main streets, will
save the city much money for maintenance and repairs.
The extension of permanent street work and the upkeep
of sidewalks, as rapidly as is consistent with economy, is
the best and most economical investment for the city. Nearly all of our most travelled thoroughfares, notably High,
Main, parts of Appleton, Cabot, Sargeant, Dwight, Hampden, Brown avenue, Pleasant, Lincoln and Northampton,
are in shamefully bad condition and will need early at- ‘
tention. The bridges, both Willimansett and South Hadley,

MAYOR'S ADDRESS  
so called, should be promptly and permanently repaired,
wood block paving being the most suitable.

Money invested in sidewalk construction and repairs
means much saving to the city in freedom from damage
suits, and the money so invested is returned to the city
treasury by the owners of abutting real estate as well as
providing work for our needy and deserving citizens.

The early performance of street and sidewalk work
would result in benefit to the public and would give many
men employment.

All important street and sewer work should be planned
and decided upon early in the year, so that the work may
be commenced at the beginning of spring and completed
before the advent of cold weather. It is to be deplored
that work of this kind has been held back in the past until
early winter for political advantage.

The mayor is, in great measure, held responsible for
public improvements or the lack thereof, and he should be
given Board of Public Works in harmony with his plans
and ideas. The city’s best interests would be conserved
by the resignation of at least one member of that important board so that work might be earried on to successful termination.

SEALER OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES
DEPARTMENT
The work performed by the Sealer of Weights and
Measures has been all that could be expected, and this de partment has rendered good service to the people of the
city as well as doing the work required by the city of Holyoke in capable and painstaking manner.
ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT

It might be well to give the recommendations relative

to investigation of bridges, county and canal, some thought.

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS
This department will be conferred with later regarding the
matter. ,

OVERSEERS OF THE POOR

Public charities of municipal nature are distributed
by the officials of this department. This work should be

- done cautiously and sympathetically.

Kindness and helpfulness should go together, with the
hope of lightening the hearts of the unfortunates and their
dependents: To make life more cheerful and distress less
burdensome is wholesome and Christian duty, and should
be the constant aim of this department.

GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT

Manager Kirkpatrick in his report says: ‘‘On July
 st, it was found necessary to advance the price of gas from
  cents per thousand feet net to  per thousand feet
net. This increase, about is only about one-third
of the increased cost of labor and materials.

‘‘Notwithstanding the greatly increased operating cost
in both plants, the department closes the year with substantial profit, estimated at about .’’

Fifty-eight thousand dollars profit!

It would seem that municipal-owned plant, in which
all of the taxpayers of Holvoke are stockholders, paying
regularly their assessments by way of gas and electricity
bills, should set aside reasonable portion of the profits to
be used for the sole purpose of reducing the price of gas
and electricity. We should aim to give the taxpayers the
benefit of the profits.

While we desire to compliment Manager Kirkpatrick |
on his good showing, the above suggestions are warranted
and should be acted upon for the benefit of the gas and |
electricity users. |

MAYOR’S ADDRESS ll
PARKS AND PLAYGROUNDS

The parks and playgrounds of our city reflect credit
upon their care and management. The Park and Playground Commissions have done well with the smal] amount
of money appropriated for park and playground purposes.

CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

While the Chamber of Commerce is not municipal
department, its untiring zeal and devotion to the best interests of the city, both from moral and business standpoint, are unquestioned.

It would be to the city’s betterment to co-operate with
this body of sound thinking men on the moral and financial
questions confronting the city of Holyoke during the coming vear. The Chamber of Commerce is comprised of professional men, business men and manufacturers, all of whom
are keen, discerning and watchful men in the city’s real
interests. This body of sterling citizens have been fully
alive to every opportunity for civic improvement, safeguard to unwise expenditures and judicious guidepost
for all that is best for Holyoke. The Chamber of Commerce by its past endeavors justly merits the distinction of
being one of Holyoke’s best institutions. .

WATER DEPARTMENT

This department under public ownership, notwithstanding the frequent changes in its official supervision, has
nevertheless furnished water to the citizens of Holyoke at
a price as low if not lower than any city within the commonwealth. It has also adequately provided for the future
growth of our city, planning and locating its reservoirs
so that they furnish the highest security of protection to
property. The successful conduct of this department reflects creditably on many successive Boards of Water Commissioners and proves conclusively that municipal ownership is both wise and practical.

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS
THE BOARD OF HEALTH
The Board of Health is another department where poli- |
ties and politicians should never enter, and until politics
did enter the board the most excellent service was rendered to the people of the city. We can expect the best from |
the new board soon to be reorganized. |
THE SCHOOLS |
The School Department under the efficient and praiseworthy supervision of Supt. Francis T. MeSherry, and
guided by the present red-blooded members of the School |
Board, merits the highest commendation from the people
of Holyoke. The School Board engages trained school
 superintendent as its executive officer, and, giving him full
authority, holds him responsible for the educational interests and progress of the school system and of all those
who are part of that system. The education of our children is immeasurably too important and too sacred to be
made football in city politics. No appropriation can be
spent for better purpose than that of educating the children of our city. The better education we give the children, the better will be our city. The School Board is not |
given to extravagance and can be safely relied upon to
spend the appropriation wisely and efficiently. The School
Board stood manfully by our city and our children when
a recent attempt was made by invisible government to inject politics into the publie schools—a damnable attempt
to force by dastardly threats the awarding of unearned diplomas to the children of certain influential politicians. God
help Holyoke when men fall so low in polities as to stone
the progress and development of our public schools and
stifle the ambitions of our children. Let us not too quickly
forget Dr. J. H. Potts and the splendid brave men who
prevented this.
The good reputation of our city for the excellence of
its schools is widely known and should be maintained.

MAYOR'S ADDRESS  
LICENSE COMMISSION AND POLICE DEPARTMENT

There is very old and true saying that pure water
cannot flow from an impure spring, so we must not cherish
too fondly the hope that better saloon conditions might prevail from License Board controlled by repudiated and :
mercenary politicians. The Police Department, comprising
men of high order of intelligence, of character and courage, should not relax their efforts or allow any interference
with their orders and desires for comprehensive and impartial enforcement of the laws.

Some policemen will be required to do traffic duty, a
hazardous and perhaps very unhealthful job. There will
be no thoughts or desire for revenge in detailing men for
that duty, and as soon as practical plan can be worked
out the hours will be made somewhat pleasanter.

CITY CHARTER

We have vastly outgrown our municipal charter. It
may be argued that we have made progress under it, but
we have made progress not because of it, but in spite of
it. It is not at this time sufficient for our needs and could
be revised and fashioned to the best thought of the day.

SUGGESTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The following suggestions and recommendations are
submitted to the respective departments:

 Psychopathic ward to be used for the care of drug |
addicts, persons under mental observation and extreme alcoholic eases in need of physical and mental treatment. There
should be some place other than the padded cell for the
Immediate care of those unfortunates.

 To install much-needed shower bath in the West
Street School.

 would resvectfully suggest to the incoming City
Marshal, with the consent of the Justice of the police court,

  MAYOR'S ADDRESS .
that the newspapers be requested not to publish the names

of poor unfortunates arrested for the disease of drunkenness, where no other offense has been committed by those

so charged.

 Better street car service for the men and women
working in Chicopee and Chicopee Falls. Would suggest
the Board of Aldermen take this matter up immediately by

conference.

 It would seem the essence of wisdom that street
railway traffic at Cabot street be resumed and satisfactory financial adjustment made with the Holyoke Street
Railway Company for the building of two cement bridges in
that locality. The Board of Aldermen will find when taking
the matter up that the street railway officials will deal fairly
with the city.

 Holyoke, unlike many cities in the commonwealth,
makes October the final day for the payment of taxes;
failure to pay on that day carries with it the additional burden of interest from October  recommend that the final
day for payment of taxes be extended to November  and
that all unpaid taxes at said date bear interest from October in each year. In making this recommendation am
positive that it will be greatly appreciated by tax-payers,
large and small, and will in no way unduly burden our city
finances.

 Joy-ride parties and family picnics, given by city
officials in automobiles, will no longer be tolerated. City
officials, and employes as well, will be expected to give
regular daily working hours, and three-hours-a-day jobs at
the City Hall will not be in fashion during  .

CONCLUSION |

We must all work together for better, cleaner, more
healthful and prosperous city. Checks drawn to the order
of municipal happiness, prosperity and health will never

MAYOR’S ADDRESS  
be finally paid unless there is deposit of honest effort
against them. few may get by, as in the past, but the
overdraft is soon detected. The public is very alert paying teller.

Sooner or later, at some time, every man in public life
must submit to the acid test. The glittering gold-brick cannot withstand it.

Glint has but short life at the longest. The public
man must prove himself worthy the test—working honestly and determinedly for the public interest.

The City of Holyoke is one of the fairest in the land,
favorably situated in the beautiful Connecticut Valley it has
much to make for its future progress and prosperity. With
its fine institutions, its many industries, its active business
and its exdingly intelligent and God-loving people, Holyoke should make rapid strides in the near future.

And gentlemen of the Board of Aldermen, we should
be ever mindful during our public life that we are but
the servants of the people, commissioned to do their work
honestly and well, and entrusted with all their wishes and
commands.

Let us work together for good government—the welfare and the common good of all the people. |

In all that is undertaken for these ends, need and ask
your most earnest support and co-operation. Let us work
together for all the people, and not for any faction or any
clique.

If we have differences of opinion in our deliberations,
let those differences be honest ones. And through it all, let
our watchword and our ever-constant aim be progress and
economy—a better and cleaner city morally and more
healthful and prosperous one. |

Without stinting necessary department appropriations,
without cutting needed improvements, or neglecting streets

and sidewalks, we should strive to the utmost for satis  MAYOR'S ADDRESS
factory tax rate, encouraging to our present industries
and attractive enough, to have new industries locate here.
. We must not forget, however, the changed financial
conditions, occasioned by the financial needs of the Na. tional Government, and that our real business from now
on is to win the war. Even at great inconvenience, all
other matters must be secondary to that one great object.

I regret having to report notable increase in the num- —
ber of women arrested during the year. Drunkenness
claims the largest number of victims and caring for theso
women constitutes the hardest part of the matron’s work.

Many places of ill-repute were closed during the year
and the inmates were brought into Court and fined, the proprietors are now serving jail sentences.

Four women and eight girls have been placed in the
House of Good Shepherd in Springfield to try and save them from prison record. .

I am very grateful to the ladies of the Needle Work
Guild for their generous gift of new garments. desire to
express my thanks to the Marshal and his assistants, also
the members of the force for their many courtesies shown
me; also for their kind assistance and co-operation in my
work and to extend my gratitude to all those who have
responded to my appeal for clothing or any way assisted 
in my duties as Police Matron.

Respectfully submitted, .

 REPORT OF THE
Fire Commissioners
' Office of Fire Commissioners,
Holyoke, Mass., December .
To the Honorable Mayor and Aldermen.

Gentlemen :—It is with pleasure that we submit to you
the report of the Fire Department for the year ending
December .

The Board of Fire Commissioners, consisting of Sidney
E. Whiting, George C. Robert and James H. O'Connell,
met January  th,  and organized by the election oi
Sidney E. Whiting as Chairman, George C. Robert as ViceChairman and John Hildreth as Secretary.

There have been fires and alarms during the past
year. The losses on buildings amounted to anu
losses on the contents, making total fire loss
of decrease from the losses of last year of
$ .

The property endangered by fire amounted to  and the insurance upon said property amounted to
$ The insurance companies paid the sum of ..
 leaving net loss on the fires and alarms of
$ The bulk of this came from two fires, viz: The
storehouse owned by Arthur Hebert, on December ,
upon which there was loss without insurance of .
and the Elmwood Dye Works, on January upon
which there was loss of total property not insured,
$ leaving net loss of all the rest of the fires of
only .

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS

No words of ours are needed to draw your attention to
the efficiency of your Fire Department, but we must congratulate Chief Hurley and the officers and men under him
for the splendid services they have given the city. We
appreciate fully the dangerous and difficult duties of fire
fighter; many daring and gallant deeds are done by a
fireman on cold and bitter nights that compare favorab!y
with the wonderful record that is being made by the soldiers
at the front. Seven of our brave boys have responded to
the call of the Flag and have gone to the front to help fight
our battles for freedom, viz: Patrick E. Smith, Arthur Hart,
Ernest E. Guimond, Arthur L. Welch, John J. Burke, John
H. Rohan and James L. Loudon. Their places are to be
kept open for them during the continuance of the war, and
we sincerely trust that all the seven may return to us safe
and sound. Two persons have lost their lives during the year by
fire, viz: Alice Dumont, aged five vears, on June ;

| cause, playing with toy lantern; Edwyn A. MacDonald,
aged five years, on November  th,  cause, playing
around grass fire.

There were alarms caused from brush fires, from
hot ashes, and from cigarette stubs. little care on the
part of our citizens would have prevented most all of these

» fires, and we urge upon the eitizens generally to take
greater care in disposing of their hot ashes, throwing awav
cigar and cigarette stubs and dropping matches near dry
leaves. The cost to the city of all these runs is verv
considerable, most of which eould have been avoided.

There were needless alarms, and while the Commissioners are glad to have anyone eall out the Depart
ment when necessary, it does seem as though false alarms
were altogether too many. Every time the Department responds to an alarm, the traftie of the ‘city has to be re :
stricted and interfered with so that the fire apparatus may

REPORT OF’ FIRE COMMISSIONERS  
have free right-of-way, and an alarm should never be rung
unless you have good reason to believe there is fire; then
there should be no delay.

We are glad to notice that great improvement in the
number of fires caused by children playing with matches
is shown, only three occurring last year. ,

 We have installed at Elmwood during the past year, a
Seagrave gallon Combination Pumper, at cost of
$ This displaces five horses. We have also purchased
and equipped an auto and hose truck for the Highlands.
which displaces two horses. These two pieces of apparatus
have greatly added to the efficiency of the Department.
and we trust that our recommendation to completely mo
torize the Department, which, will still further improve the
service, may be adopted.

On October  th,  the Fire Department co-operated
in the general movement as requested by the President of
th United States, known as Fire Prevention Day, by assembling the entire Department in front of the headquarters
and giving display of its various apparatus. We believe
that the exhibition demonstrated to the many persons who

saw it the efficiency of the Department and of the apparatus that is owned by the Department. Many of the exhibi
tions were novel to most citizens and showed them how fires
ean be controlled in cellars and places difficult to get to.
We believe that this exhibition should be an annua!
affair, and we take this opportunity for thanking the
School Department for its co-operation with us in this national movement.
Your Commissioners urge that the following recommendations receive your careful consideration:

First :—We reiterate our recommendation of last vear—
the complete motorization of the Department on the
grounds of efficiency and economy. We have given this
matter’ very careful consideration and an investigation of
this matter will, we believe, convince you that your Com  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS
missioners are right in making the following recommendations.
We need the following pieces of apparatus to completely motorize the Department, as follows, viz:
House No.  gallon hose and pumping engine.
House No.  tractor for steam fire engine.
House No.  gallon triple combination automo- |
bile. |
House No.  tractor for steam fire engine. !
House No.  automobile hook and ladder truck.
House No.  combination hose and chemical automobile.
House No.  automobile hook and ladder truck.
These would cost approximately the following sums:  gallon pump ...............eeee U
  gallon pump .............       §— 
Combination hose and chemical ................ hook and ladder trucks .....................+. tractors for engines ...........  cc   
Total ...... cc         es ve   
Second :—For many years we have recommended the
building of new engine house in Ward One. The introduction of motor driven apparatus has changed conditions
materially in this Ward and we believe the present Engine
House can be so changed by adding one or two stories, at
a moderate cost, so as to give the men individual sleeping
rooms and greater accommodation, and the location is so
excellent that we think it would be difficult to improve it in
) many respects. We therefore recommend that the above
changes be made.
Third :—We recommend that Station No. Two at South
Holyoke be so changed as to give the men individual sleeping rooms, and that there be drill tower erected there, so

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS  
that the men can be trained in the use of modern fire
equipment. We have had number of men in the department trained for this work, but have never been able to
earry out the same fully for want of drill tower. The
National Board of Fire Underwriters recommend the erec- .
tion of this tower.

Fourth :—The National Board of Fire Underwriters
recommends the adoption and enforcement of an up-to-date
eode of building laws, which recommendation your Board
of Fire Commissioners readily join.

Fifth :—The men and officers of the Fire Department

‘ have petitioned your Board for an increase in pay, based
upon the increased cost of living, and your Board feels that
this matter must be given serious attention, but that no increase can be made in the salaries of either officers or men
unless the appropriation made is sufficiently large to enable
your Commissioners to do this. We recommend that this
matter be given attention. ,

Sixth :—We recommend that there should be special
appropriation of  for cable extensions, test posts and
street signals. .

Seventh:—We recommend that there should be appropriated at least  for the purchase of new hose. ,

Eighth:—We recommend that there should be purchased ten new fire alarm boxes, as we believe that it is
economy to place fire alarm boxes wherever the same are
needed, and this will require special appropriation for
$ .

) Ninth:—We reiterate our recommendation of last
September that the traffic rules be amended so that the
street cars shall stop on the near side of the street. Recent
accidents have confirmed your Commissioners in the opinion
that public safety and convenience will be well served by |
making this change.

FIRE ALARM TELEGRAPH
) This branch of the fire service is in very good condition,
with one exception: there are many old and antiquated fire
alarm boxes which should be replaced with new and modern boxes suitable in connection with our new system. This
should be done as speedily as possible, so as to enable us to
get full and effective benefit.from our new system.
The value of the equipment and apparatus in this Department is .

HAY AND FEED

Owing to the very high cost of feed and bedding, the

Department has kept but very small stock on hand. |

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS .
Fortunately, we do not require so much since the partial
motorization of the Department.

: HOUSES

Generally the houses are in good condition, with the
exception of House No.  .

HOSE

We have feet of inch hose, of which  
feet is good hose, feet of fair hose, and feet of
poor hose, which should be replaced as early as possible, as
the Department ought not to depend upon hose that has
been in use for great many years.

The following is the amount of hose on hand:

Total oo...         sees  

We have purchased this year feet of  -inch hose.
We have given to the Board of Public Works and public
institutions during the past vear feet of  -inch hose
which has ceased to be useful for the Department.

We have found in actual service that the  -inch hose
is very serviceable in the Department, and has increased
efficiency very materially. We think it wise to purchase
more of this as soon as possible.

HORSES

There are horses in the Department, and many of

them are growing unfit for service in the Fire Department.

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS  
We trust that the complete motorization of the Fire Department will dispense with. horses altogether, as they are
expensive to maintain, cause unsanitary conditions about
the houses, and are not as effective.
DRILL SCHOOL The work of the Department in the Drill School has
been conducted by First Deputy Chief McLean during the
summer, and all the members of the Department have been
thoroughly drilled in the use of the various apparatus in
the Department. An exhibition was given on Fire Prevention Day which demonstrated to the people the value of
this Arill,

‘We cannot thoroughly drill the members of the Department until drill tower is built, and such tower is
mperative and should be attended to without delay. We
have been recommending this for number of years and
we trust that it will be speedily installed.

INSPECTION OF BUILDINGS |

 Ihe Department has made inspections of build- .
NS uring the year, and we have generally found our
“tizens ready to co-operate in the matter of keeping the
buildings free from rubbish and waste paper, the accumulation of which causes many fires. Occasionally some citi  Seems to think that it is an interference of his private
"ight to have the Department insist upon buildings being
kept in safe condition, but the Department is authorized
odo this by law, and we are glad to find that most citi recognize that the safety of their property depends
Pon eomplying with the requirements of the Department.
The decreased number of fires last year, we believe, is in a
 reat measure to be accounted for by the general compliance of our citizens with the requirements of the Department,

I wish once more to emphasize the urgent necessity of —

able to the needs of the institution. |
Although the present Finance Committee of the Board
of Aldermen recommended the construction of these much
needed additions, nothing has yet been done.
The construction of new refrigerator is matter that
cannot be much longer deferred, because of the large quantities of milk, butter, eggs, meats and other perishable supplies which need proper refrigeration.
The matter of providing more sleeping rooms for the
emplovees is again called to your attention. Thanking your e
honorable board for your kindness and assistance, and also
the emplovees of the City Farm for their faithfulness and
efficiency.

ANNUAL REPORT
OF
* Holyoke Playground Commission
 
To the Honorable Mayor and Board of Aldermen of the
City of Holvoke.

, The activities on the Publie Playgrounds during the
vear have been fully set forth in the report of Supervisor P. H. Kelly, and which is herewith attached.

The Commission fully endorses the recommendations of
Supervisor Kelly regarding fencing the grounds, and also
the need of better bathing facilities, especially in Wards
One and Two, these sections of the city being without bath
houses. This matter should ive your earnest consideration. It  to be hoped that Holyoke, at no distant date,
will have an up-to-date bathing pool of generous dimensions
where this fine sport can be indulged in by all.

. gratifving feature in connection with the Public
Playgrounds, is the grand response to the eall to the colors
by members of the various athletic elubs who use the
grounds for their games and many of whose members have
grown up with the playground movement in Holvoke, and
there is no doubt but the opportunities thus afforded, have
in degree, at least, contributed towards the upbuilding of
a sturdy young manhood which realizes the value of organization and diseipline, and which, together with determination and courage, are factors bound to win, not only in

| the sports but in the battles of nation.

We are proud that thev have realized that ‘‘the true

|

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
test Of lowal Americanism is in effective service’’ and that
they have given all that youth has to offer on the altar of
patriotism and are ready to do their part in ‘‘keeping the
world safe for democraey.’’

Respectfully submitted,
— ARCHIBALD A. BROOKS, Chairman.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE
Supervisor of the Holyoke Playgrounds
FOR  
To the Board of Playground Commissioners, Holyoke, Mass.

In accordance with custom, beg leave to submit herewith my sixth Annual Report as Supervisor of the Holyoke

Playgrounds for the season of  .

The summer season of our playgrounds opened July
  and closed August  covering period of eight weeks.
Our playgrounds offer great variety of activity; thus
children cannot fail to be interested, as is shown by. their
response. Each playground adapts itself to the needs of
its own neighborhood, thereby becoming greater influence for good, and making itself part and parcel of the
daily community life.

 SUPERVISION

Supervised play, swimming and industrial work were
conducted as follows:

(a) In sehool yards: Elm Street, Hamilton Street,
Morgan, Kirtland, Highland and William Whiting Schools.

(b) On public parks: Springdale and Highland
Parks.

(ec) On public playgrounds: Elmwood, Maple Street,

; Hampden Street, West Street and Prospect Field.

(d) At bath houses: Ward  Ward  Ward  .

The fundamental principle of the playground movement is the need of good supervision. This your honorable

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
board has insisted on. And it has been maintained with
gratifying results, as is evidenced by the numerous in.
quiries from cities and towns far and near, desirous of im.
provirrg their playground work. Other cities may have
more elaborate and better equipped playgrounds; but in
no place is manifest finer spirit than that shown by those
who labored so earnestly to keep Holyoke leader in playground work. It has been the aim of the supervisor to
conduct the activities of the playgrounds, so that boys and
girls, men and women, shall have safe, pleasant and
wholesome place in which to enjoy their hours of rest and
recreation.

 PHYSICAL EDUCATION

The primary aim of the playground department is to
provide, through its buildings, recreation fields and skat- |
ing rinks, an opportunity for the people young and old to
gather for physical improvement and mental relaxation.
This encourages and promotes the practice of indulging in
beneficial sports and games. Moreover, such course aids in
developing courage, self respect, admiration of skill, desire
of eficiency, sense of justice, and above all, love of fair
Play. With this aim always in sight, each year we try to
enrich the program of our activities, so that all may feel
more keenly the attachment and the interest of the play
ground.

With the-varied schedule for the different play activities, arranged at the Playground office, care had been taken
to adopt the events to the strength and the endurance of
the boys and girls who enter the games. And under the
Supervision of men and women trained in work of this kind
all are given an opportunity to participate in the various
events,

  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS FOLK DANCING
Abbie J. Williams, Supervisor
This department has shown marked advancement, each
playground was visited twice week, one hour each day
was devoted to folk dancing on all of the playgrounds.
Folk Dancing stands out prominently. It is no longer
necessary to urge its advancement in the educational world;
for it has taken its place definitely as needed form of
recreational activity. The simple and obvious reasons for
this success are found in the healthful exercise which the
 Folk Dance affords. This suecess becomes immediately
evident when one notes the hearty delight of our girls
when participating in these dances. And from this participation they derive more vigorous exercises than they would
through less enjovable movements. In addition, there is
the love of beauty and rvthm for which modern life seems
to afford little opportunity, love which expresses itself
spontaneously in Folk Dances, containing the emotional experiences of the race. There is connected with the Folk
Danees love of the open, of vigor and of the joy of activity for its own sake. Through the Folk Dances we have
many opportunities to edueate the social and moral side
of the child, and to direct the formation of right habits and
high ideals of conduct. |

faney work bags with silk, the sewed baskets made of
raffia and reed, were beautifully designed and proved valuable additions to many homes as serving baskets. Trinket
baskets, pin trays, pencil trays and jardinieres. The pine

crocheting was added and proved very popular. This was
evidenced by the large display of crocheting shown dung
the closing exhibit. Some of the articles made were yokes
for corset covers, edging on handkerchiefs, night gowns,
doilies and market bags.

Instructions in sewing were given daily on all our play
centers, in addition, each playground was visited once @—
week by the supervisor, who planned and designed the
work. The course was practically the same as that of othe:
seasons. The particular garments chosen in the course
progresses from the simpler to the more complex processes

STORY TELLING
Story telling on the playgrounds is earried on by the
Directors and their Assistants, at such time as the children may need rest from play.

-It is understood that all playground workers who have
any gift in this direction may feel free to tell or read stories
to the children. Dr. G. Stanley Hall savs: ‘‘Indeed I
almost think that if were Plato’s wise tvrant and had to
appoint teachers of the young, and if could have but
one, the only one of which would subject candidates would
be whether or not they could tell good story; for this
alone would test their sympathy and power of adaptation.’’

Story telling ranks with any other occupation in the
power of producing good results. It trains child to contemplate the ideal in life and in conduct. By developing

his imagination it makes him more sympathetic to the

thoughts and feelings of others, thus it makes him more

unselfish, it trains him to greater power of concentration

and attention; and the re-telling of the stories by the child
. himself leads to the forming of clearer mental images to the

grasping of moral truths, and to the use of good English.

BASE BALL

To give every boy an opportunity to play base ball is
one of the problems of playground director.

At the start of the season, three leagues were organized: The Midget, the Junior and the Senior.

, The weight limit in each league was: Midgets,  
pounds; Juniors, pounds, and Seniors, pounds. The |
section of the bovs to represent the different teams is left |
entirely with the directors. This insures keener competition, creates better feeling, and prevents the possibility
of getting the majority of the best players on one team.

The grounds represented were the Elmwood, Maple
Street, Chestnut Street, Hampden Street, West Street and
Morgan School.

The Midget League plaved schedule of twenty games.
The games took place on Tuesday and Thursday mornings.
The Junior and Senior Leagues played schedule of thirty
games. The Junior League games were played on Monday,
Wednesday and Friday mornings, and the Senior League
games were played on Monday, Wednesday and Friday
afternoons. total of one hundred and fifty games were
plaved representing different bows.

Great interest was manifested in each league. The
vames were witnessed by crowds of children, parents and
friends of the bovs. The greatest interest was centered in
the Senior League. At the close of the season, the Hampden Street and West Street teams were tied for the pennant.

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
The deciding game was played August on the Prospect F‘ield. The game was won by the Hampden Street
team by» the score of to  This was fitting finish for our
base ball season.
SKATING
Six skating rinks were maintained during the winter
maths as follows: |
Hampden Street Newtons Pond

The weather was exceptionally good for this kind of
‘Port. and skating was enjoyed for nine weeks.

DEVELOPMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS
(a) During the past season number of improvements and additions were made on our playgrounds. Not| able among these improvements was the opening of New
Play Center at the Kirtland School. This was popular
move, establishing playground in this section of the city.
: The action was especially appreciated by the parents of
the ehildren. Two sets of swings, two teeter boards, one
slide, basket and vollev ball court and sand boxes were
installed, making this an ideal Play Center.
MORGAN STREET PLAYGROUNDS
(b) The construction of new fence around this playground was much needed improvement, and adds greatly
to the appearance of the grounds. It also serves to keep the
children from the street, thereby avoiding much danger,
as the traffic about this section is very heavy. The grounds
were reloamed and some of the apparatus was moved
around to get better results.
ELMWOOD PLAYGROUNDS
(ec) The base ball field on this ground was harrowed
and graded. The diamond was rolled and placed in very
good eondition. The back stop was resereened and extended. Filling in the dingle at the Carlton Street end of
the ground is progressing slowly. With this section filled
, and leveled it will make an ideal place of which to erect a
bath house which has long been demanded by the people of
this section.
HAMPDEN STREET PLAYGROUNDS
(d) This is considered the finest playground in this
section of the State. It contains everything that goes to
make up an ideal playground.
! During the past season the new fence was completed.
|

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
Four brick pillars were built at each corner of the fence,
and the entrances on Hampden and on Dwight Streets were
beautified by the erection of pillars capped with brown
stone. The ground was graded and grassed. Trees and
shrubbery were planted around the border, which added
greatly to the appearance of these grounds. It is planned
neXt season to build small fence enclosing one corner of
the g@round. This section is to be known as the baby’s cornee, Wherein baby swings, sand boxes and tables with
shades will be set aside exclusively for mothers and their
bbies.
WEST STREET PLAYGROUND
Ce) The base ball field was harrowed and rolled, the
wading pool was rebuilt and refilled with sand, and two teeter
bards were added. This playground is equipped with all :
kinds of play apparatus, two base ball diamonds and foot
ball field, and affords plenty of opportunity to engage in
Ut oor recreation. In winter the wading pool is flooded
for Skating. The grounds are well lighted, and evening
recreation is enjoyed by large number of adults as well
"S$ children. ,
MAPLE STREET PLAYGROUNDS
 (f) At the opening of the season new sand boxes were
built. The swings were repaired, and new slide was added.
The field was re-loamed, graded and put in fine condition,
but it did not long remain so. The elevation on this field is
Such that it is impossible to keep it in good condition. With
the Slightest rainfall, ridges are cut in the field and the loom
@nd sand is carried on to Maple Street. This could be
 VOided by building wall on the Maple Street side of the ,
 Tround. At present it is not advisable to go to any great
“Xpense on this playground, as it is understood that it may )
be taken from the control of the Playground Commission
at any time and the land used for other purposes.

  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS
SCHOOL CENTERS

(g) At the opening of the season conference was
held with the Superintendent of Schools, the schools to be
used were visited and certain rooms were assigned for playground purposes. It was suggested that partitions be built
so that children would not enter any other part of the
buildings. This request was complied with, Partitions
were erected at all the School Centers and everything was

done to meet the requirements of the School Board.

| CITY LEAGUE BASEBALL

(h) This Base Ball League is composed of teams reyresenting the leading athletic associations of our city. Each
| year schedule of games is arranged and played on vur
playgrounds. The matter of finances with which to carry
en this sport has been problem to the managers, and the
} Playground Commission has been repeatedly called upon
to assist in maintaining the league. At the opening of the
season the commission decided to finance this league. A
meeting was called by the organizers at which the Chairman, Supervisor and Superintendent of the Playgrounds
were in attendance. Plans were made whereby the Playground Commission would have control of the conduct of
play. This arrangement proved very satisfactory to the
, managers of the League. The wisdom of the Playground
Commission in taking this step is evident. It was indeed a
step in the right direction, for it eliminated the many
financial difficulties of past years. The interest of the Commission in this movement was repaid in two-fold measure: First in the supervision and conduct of play which
is now matter of civil pride, secondly in the hearty whole
souled interest of the thousands of spectators who enjoy

the privilege of witnessing the City League games.

EVENING PLAYGROUND SESSIONS

Nothing was more gratifying than the attendance at
the evening sessions. Four playgrounds, Maple Street,
Hampden Street, West Street and Morgan School were open
evenings with supervised play from seven until nine P.
M. during the months of July and August. Many young
people and older folks who work during the day attended
and obtained the much needed recreation, and every person
showed desire to help in some way to make their recrea- |

, tion field the best. One result of the evening playground

svstem was the organization of several athletic associations }
Which stood for the very best in sports and sportsmanship ,
and by bringing into united action the various groups of the ,
eommunity.

These societies broadened the range of vision and  increased the strength of movement for evening recreation.

During the eight weeks that the four playgrounds were |
open the total attendance was  The average nightly
attendance for the four grounds was  .

SWIMMING

The physical benefits derived from swimming are so
valuable to the boys and girls that the privilege should be
extended as rapidly as conditions and money will permit.

The three bath houses located in Ward One, Ward Four
and Ward Six are inadequate. It is common occurrence
to have three and four boys dress in each of the lockers, and
the pools have been so crowded at times that it was impossible to swim. Something should be done to relieve this
congestion.

The bath houses were open for period of nine weeks
during the months of July and August, from to A.

' M. and from to P. M., and on Wednesday and
Friday evenings from to  Two lady instructors were
placed in charge at each bath house on Wednesday and

ATTENDANCE

The popularity of our playground is evidenced by the
large number of children who visit the grounds daily. This
serves as an excellent index to the feeling of children in
regard to the playgrounds, although each season the at- |
tendance has shown steady increase. This year was an
exception as the attendance showed slight decrease.

In the attendance was  in a
decrease of  This decrease can be attributed to several reasons, our country being at war has created unprecedented conditions, and the great demand for labor found
many even of our younger boys and girls doing their bit in
various ways. .

SPECIAL EVENTS
The special events held during the season are all
 worthy of record. It is the constant aim of the times in
: all branches of the playground work. World conditions
in general and the military air new born in our country
since the declaration of war, proffered an excellent oppor| tunity this year of fostering the spirit of patriotism in the
| minds and hearts of our embryonic men. At the opening
of the season three hundred wooden guns were ordered
!
|

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
and divided between the six larger playgrounds, Elmwood,
Hampden Street, Maple Street, Chestnut Street, Morgan
School and West Street. Drill companies were organized,
arrangements were made and two afternoons each week |
were devoted to drilling. This formed very popular with
the boys.

On August  rd, Military Day was held. All the boys
in the city were permitted to take part, and nearly one
thousand boys participated on this occasion. The boys
gathered on their respective grounds, and formed into line,
headed by their military company; those not in the company carried American Flags and marched where the parade stared. Led by two mounted Provost Guards from !
Camp Bartlett, platoon of police, buglers from the Home
Guards, each company with its own drummer, the patriotic :
procession fell into line.

The line of march was through the principal streets of |
the city and was reviewed at the City Hall by the Mayor,
Playground Commission and members of the City Government. The boys were given round after round of applause
from admiring parents and friends and were viewed by
thousands of spectators.

Two silver cups were given by the Playground Commission, one to the company having the largest number in
line and the other to the best appearing company. The
Judges were Major W. J. Crosier and Sergeants Gillis, Green
and Frederick Childs.

Chestnut Street won the cup for the largest number,

 and the West Street carried off the honors for the best appearing company.
- BASE BALL FIELD DAY
The annual Base Ball Field Day was held August  th,
on the Prospect Field. The event is always looked forward to with great interest by the boys, as all compete for

  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS
the championship of the city in their respective divisions,
the Midgets, Juniors and Seniors. “
The events consisted of Fungo hitting, throwing the  
base ball,  and  -vard dashes, running the four .
bases and throwing the base ball to second base and return. First, second and third prizes were awarded in each
event. The prizes were cuff buttons, stick pins and wateh
fobs, donated by A. Steiger Company. Six playgrounds |
were represented and the grounds scoring the greatest number of points received silver eup. This was presented by
the Playground Commission and was won by Chestnut |

BAND CONCERTS
During the months of July and August, series of
eight band concerts were held on the local playgrounds.
These concerts were held on the Prospect Field, Hamilton
Park, Springdale Park, and on both the Maple and West
Street Playgrounds. |
The Chamber of Commerce was the prime mover in ar- .
ranging the concerts. Through their efforts the Board of
! Aldermen voted special appropriation of four hundred
| dollars for the cause, and the Chamber of: Commerce itself
contributed two hundred dollars.

os REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
ne The planning of the concerts was left to committee,
from the Chamber of Commerce and the Playground Comae mission. The concerts were largely attended and appreiy ciated by thousands of people.
ee CLOSING FESTIVAL
ae The closing exercises, held on the Prospect Field,
ene August  th, were fitting finale to our season of summer ,
ae activities, and were witnessed by the largest gathering in
ot the history of the playgrounds. The articles made by the
(x children on the different playgrounds were on exhibition at
the Shelter House on the Hampden Street playgrounds. This
display was very beautiful and received many expressions
of appreciation from those who saw it. The  inspiring
wil! sight of hundreds of children dressed in their best, the
, girls in white, all with brightly colored sashes and happy
; eager faces lightened many heart, bringing back to the
. spectators memories of their own childhood days. The
ho games and dances shown the visitors were those of our every

A. RECOMMENDATIONS
- The necessity of fencing our playgrounds is again
ealled to your attention. good start has been made the
| past two seasons by fencing the Hampden Street and Morgan School grounds. would suggest that the practice of
fencing one playground each year be continued until all
our playgrounds are enclosed.
B. SWIMMING
, In my last report urged the development of better
facilities for swimming. The present Bath Houses are inadequate. They serve only the small children and some
women. This service is not such that we can be proud of.

At the close of the season, the Ward One Bath House
and the land on which it was located was purchased by the
Dean Steam Pump Company. This leaves this section of
the city without public bathing place. Some arrangements
should be made to replace it at once.

The problem of better bathing facilities should receive
careful consideration. would suggest that special appropriation be asked in order to carry on this work.

C.
More apparatus is neded on several of our playgrounds.
 would recommend the purchase of two giant strides, three
slides and four sets of baby swings, to be placed as follows: At the Whiting School, two slides; at the Kirtland

r REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  School, one giant stride and one slide, and on the Hampden Street playgrounds four sets of baby swings.

  REPORT OF THE CITY ENGINEER
BRIDGES

With the advance in motor truck construction horse
driven vehicles have been practically displaced for ordinary
business purposes. The size and carrying capacity of
trucks is so rapidly increasing that it is common occurence to see ten ton truck on our ordinary business streets
at the present time. The problem which this advance in
motor construction presents to our City in particular is most ,
serious on account of the large number of bridges which we
have to maintain.

. Forty-five years ago when some of the old bridges were
constructed present day conditions did not exist. The old
bridges such as those on Lyman and Cabot Streets over the
Ist and  nd level canals and Sargeant Street over the  nd
level canal were designed for traffic at that time. When we
take into consideration the combined effect of depreciation
of the bridges and increased loadings we must naturally conclude that these bridges will need most careful expert in, spection to determine their safety under present conditions.

) would recommend that all metal work of the bridges,

both county and canal bridges, receive attention this year.

Several sets of plans have been made for the replacing of the

bridges over the Ist and  nd level canals on Cabot street to

meet the growing needs of the City. In the upper canal bridge was strengthened and street railway travel resumed on Cabot Street. Since this bridge was reinforced it

has proved of ample strength to carry all travel both, street

railway and ordinary traffic. There is always source of

danger, however, in travel over this bridge on account of the

roadway between the trusses being too narrow for the passage of car and truck at the same time. This condition

has been emphasized since the double running boards were

placed on the street cars.

| Street railway traffic over the  nd level canal bridge

was stopped last Spring by the Publie Service Commission
|
|

REPORT OF THE CITY ENGINEER  
onthe recommendation of their engineer. Plans to replace
this bridge were made at various times by this department.

The construction of the new footbridge over the Boston
and IWfLaine tracks was completed during the year and the
old irom structure removed.

STREETS

The conditions at the corner of Lincoln and Northampton Streets had for many vears been source of danger due
tothe waarrowness of the travelled way and the short curve
onthe street railway tracks. The lengthening out of the
curv zanmd widening the street at this point has practically
elmiraated all danger. Asphalt pavement ona  concrete
base wras placed on each side of the travelled way from Lin. coh to Morgan Street and the part of the street between the
traekss and for  outside was paved with. vitrified brick
ona concrete base.

On petition of the Farr Alpaca Company to establish
the lizre of South Street between the Holyoke and Westfield
Railroad and Race Street, the Board of Public Works referrecl the matter to the City Engineer for investigation and
report. An extended search of the Hampden County recods iw Springfield, the town records in West Springfield
and the Hampshire County records in Northampton failed
tounearth the original layout of South Street or any record

, of  changes made in the street. Meetings were held !
with the Germania Mills officials, officials of the Farr Alpaca
Company and the New York, New Haven and Hartford
Rulroag and line was determined satisfactory to all parWes Concerned.

A general map of the southerly end of the City was prepared showing various routes that were advocated for the
extension of High Street to meet the Springfield Road.
Rough, estimates of cost were made, but on account of the

advance in the price of materials these estimates no longer

  REPORT OF THE CITY ENGINEER |
hold good. At the request of the Planning Board the City
Engineer attended public meeting in the Chamber of
Commerce rooms and description was given of the various
routes without advocating any particular one.
{
- The act passed by the legislature authorizing cities and |
towns to establish building line on any street not more |
than forty feet from the street line, if adopted by the City
Government will solve one of the serious problems of future
city planning.
Under existing ordinances the street line is the building line and each abutter has the right, unless restricted by
his deed, to determine the character and location of building on his land without regard to adjoining properties. Occasionally permits are asked for the construction of manu- |
facturing plants, stores, ete., on residential streets. The inspector is obliged under the law to approve of any structure
which complies with the requirements of the present build, ing ordinance. Aside from the esthetic view point it is sim| ple justice that the home builder should be protected in his
investment.
Acceptance of the law and establishing ordinances under the act will be step in the right direction.
Chapter  Part  Section  Page  Gen. Acts
of is as follows :—
BUILDING LINE
If the city by its city council or other governing body
or town accepts the provisions of this section or has accepted the corresponding provisions of earlier laws, building line of not more than forty feet distant from the exterior line of highway or town way may be established in the
manner provided for laying out ways, and thereafter no
structures shall be erected or maintained between such
building line and such way, except steps, windows, porticos

REPORT OF THE CITY ENGINEER  
and other usual projections appurtenant to the front wall of
a building, to the extent prescribed in the vote establishing
such building line, and except that buildings or parts of
buildings, embankments, steps, walls, fences and gates existing at the time of the establishment of the building line may
be permitted to remain and to be maintained to such extent
and under such conditions as may be prescribed in the vote
establishing such building line. Whoever sustains damage
thereby shall have the same remedies therefor as for damages Sustained by the laying out of town way. buildIng line established under the provisions of this section may
be discontinued in the manner provided for the discontinuance Of highway or town way. Whoever sustains damages by the discontinuance of building line shall have the
in remedies therefor as for damages sustained by the
‘COntinuance of town way.
SEWERS ,
flooa atte the heavy rainstorms in the summer cellars were
was x. in sections of the City. Claims were made that this
char Ye to the defective condition of the main sewers in
&e of the City. It was found, however, in every case
Which an examination was made that the main sewers
to In proper working order and that the flooding was due
 defective construction of the house drainage, common
Practice being to connect the roof drains with the soil pipes
between the fixtures and the main. The soil pipes being of
the Same section as the conductors have not sufficient carrymg Capacity to take care of the roof water, consequently the
water in the conductor being under pressure backs up
through the fixtures especially when placed in the cellar.
A. very important addition has been made to the culvert
Maple Street during the year. Development of the land
Tecently purchased by the Farr Alpaca Company required
the rearrangement of the sewers which passed through their

  REPORT OF THE CITY ENGINEER
land between the Holyoke and Westfield Railroad tracks
and the Germania Mill.

A few years ago the Front Street sewer collapsed during storm, causing great inconvenience. Prompt action
by the Board of Public Works averted serious trouble. It
was discovered that several parts of the sewer were in danger of collapsing and that reconstruction would be necessary in the near future. The proposition of the Farr Alpaca Company to reconstruct the Dry Brook culvert and |
other sewers passing through their land was accepted by the
Board of Public Works. The work was accomplished during this year. The culvert now extends from point in
Elmwood Park opposite Walnut Street to the Connecticut
River, taking care of the Elmwood, Oakdale and Front
Street sewer systems thus relieving the City of considerable outlay at some time in the future. The extension of
: the culvert in westerly direction is the only problem now
left for solution.

Sewer assessment maps containing the names of all

; abutters, areas, frontages and assessments for all sewers

| built during the year were made in this office.

: Mr. James T. Clark, draughtsman of this department,
Was given leave of absence to enlist in the United States
Navy. He is now in active service with the Atlantic Fleet.

Plans were prepared for the Police Department for aceident cases during the year.

Farm district maps were prepared for the Board of
Assessors.

Plans of the zone system of fares proposed by the Street
Railway Company were prepared.

Several maps were made for the City Solicitor to be
used in accident cases.

REPORT OF THE CITY ENGINEER  
ISOLATION HOSPITAL

After inspection of various Isolation Hospitals in
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut many studies
were made to develop set of plans which would furnish all
the requirements of modern and up-to-date hospital and
at the same time come within the appropriation.

Plans and specifications were finally made by Architect
Beauchemin, under the direction of the City Engineer, to
meet the requirements of the State Board of Health and
our local Board. After approval by the state authorities
bids were called for and the contract awarded to M. J.
Walsh and Sons. The building is now nearing completion.

The Hospital is divided into three separate buildings,
the administration building, the ward building and the laundry ana boiler building.

The site selected is practically the same as that proposed by Landseape Architect Olmstead in his report on
city: Planning. Convenience for business purposes and
proX miity to the Street Railway were deciding factors in
P lacing the administration building near Cherry Street.
All Supplies are delivered here. By this arrangement acSS to the isolation wards can be controlled. ,

The main kitchen, refrigerator plant, pantry and store
hens Occupy the ground floor; the general offices, superin| ndent ’s quarters, nurses’ dining room and recreation room

Several small wards and single rooms for operating and obServation, diet and service kitchens and bath rooms. Pro  REPORT OF THE CITY ENGINEER
vision has also been made for future additions in case it
should be found necessary to add another floor. ;
Sterilizing, washing and drying machinery, boilers and :
eoal bins occupy the ground floor of the laundry and boiler  
building, which is reached by an underground passage from .
the ward building. All infected clothes are taken
through this passage from the soiled clothes compartment to the sterilizers. On the main floor is located
the ironing and pressing room, the clean clothes storage and ;
rooms for the employees. This building was designed with .

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE
Board of Park Commissioners
OF THE CITY OF HOLYOKE
For the Year  .
To the Honorable, the Mayor, and Board of Aldermen of
the City of Holyoke:
Gentlemen :—
In accordance with the provisions of Section of
| Chapter of the Revised Laws the Board of Park Commissioners submit herewith their annual report for the year
ending November also detailed statement of
, receipts and expenditures for the past year.

Very little work of permanent nature was done. With

the exception of new curbing and fence at Hamilton Park
and grading at Prospect and Riverside parks the appropriation was expended for maintenance work. |

The following is resume of the work on the parks
with schedule of the receipts and expenditures for the

, past vear and recommendations for the coming season.
At Hampden Park the usual maintenance work has
been done in very satisfactory manner; the walks and
turf kept in good condition and shrubbery added; new settees were also placed here. During the past few years a
number of trees have been badly damaged and lost by
storms and new trees should be planted to provide for the
future.
} At Prospect Park the seeding and grading at the west' erly end has been finished and improves this end of the

park; the large grass plots which were seeded last year
|

have made good progress and several settees added; the
Board would recommend that new walk be constructed
on the Prospect street side of the park as the present walk
IE is in very dangerous condition and also that new drink— ing fountain be installed.
ont At Elmwood Park nothing in the line of improvements has been accomplished; the grass plots, walks and
iE flower beds have been kept in fine condition and the
usual maintenance work performed. On account of the 
large number of women and children using this park
a shelter should be provided for their accommodation;
{ets the culvert should be extended to Pine street so that
the improvement work could be brought up to this point. The Board has made arrangements for the planting of ever| greens On the bank on the Ross avenue side the coming
ne spring and when set out will make pleasing attraction to
Pat this park. large skating rink on Bh street side profar te vides excellent skating in the winter.
tee" At Riverside Park the play facilities continue to please
; the children, the wading pool being very popular in the
ie summer months and the skating rink in the winter; new
ae POSCS have been added to the garden and much filling and
the grading accomplished; the grass plots and walks have been
cared for in thorough manner and the park makes an
can attractive appearance. The growing use of the park by
en the Women and children demands shelter and one should

a

  REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS
At Jones Park no work of permanent nature has
been done. If an appropriation could be had for improve’ ment the Board would like to start the development of
this park; trees should also be set out to take the place of
the chestnut trees which were removed. The Board would
also recommend that nursery be started on this park.
The old Jones Home which stood on this park was destroved by fire in the spring and the sum of  was re
ceived for insurance on the same which was added to our
appropriation.
Fairfield Avenue Parkway, Laurel Park and the small
triangles have been given the usual care and attention
, and make attractive additions to their localities.
In conclusion, the Board would ask for serious con. sideration of its recommendations and anticipating an
increase in the wages of its employees for the coming
, season would ask an increase of  for its maintenance account making total appropriation for maintenance
| of  and also an appropriation for improvement |

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD
To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen :—

The Board of Water Commissioners respectfully submit the following as their report for the fiscal year ending
November  th,  ,

The organization of the Board for the year was the
same as for the preceding year: Mr. Jesse E. Sheldon,
Chairman; Mr. Hugh MeLean, Vice-Chairman, and Mr.
Joseph F. Ranger, Treasurer.

You are respectfully referred to the superintendent's

report, which is made part of this report, for detailed
account of the loeations, sizes and costs of the pipe extensions, new services, hydrants, gates and meters installed
during the past year and also to the tables herewith an, nexed for information concerning rainfall, consumption of |
water, both domestic and metered, and other items which
may be of interest.

The receipts for water rents for the year were  and the gross receipts not including the 
Bond Issue for the completion of the so-called Fomer Extension were  which is  more than the
gross receipts for the vear  .

The expenditures not including construction of Fomer
Extension were this includes taxes paid to the
City by the department amounting to  interest on

| bonds, serial bond payment, transfer
to the Sinking Fund of  and  placed to account
of Young vs. City of Holyoke to meet the Judgment of the
court in litigation concerning the construction of the dam
at the White Reservoir which we are not allowed to pay
on aceount of attachments upon the money.

The Sinking Fund was increased during the year
$ making the total amount in the Sinking Fund
at the close of the vear leaving the net bonded
indebtedness of the department  on November  th,  .

REPORT OF WATER BOARD  
‘ The eash balance in bank at the end of the fiscal year
was  which includes the  transferred to
Young. vs. City -of Holyoke account;  transferred Serial Bond debt due April Ist,  and balance
of Fomer: Extension account, leaving cash balance in the
Water Works account of  which is  more
than was on hand at the elose of the fiscal year  .

The Board is pleased to report the final settlement of |
the annoying and expensive lawsuits which were brought
against the department by the original contractor for the
dam at the White Reservoir... Late in the summer verdict
of  was rendered in his favor by the master in
the case arising out of the conversion of machinery, tools
and supplies. While this amount was much more than what 
we considered fair value for the same, vet we thought it
best to pay it, together with all the bills incidental to this
litigation, rather than carry the case further. The contractor has yet to receive the sum which was awarded him
by the court in the equity case amounting to  with
interest from May  th,  which we are prevented from
paying him on account of attachments. We have, however, set  aside in separate account to meet this
payment when the attachments against the money are removed and we are glad that the litigation is ended. Including this sum of  set aside for deferred payment,
these lawsuits have cost us  during the year  .

The case of Edward P. Bell against us for land taken
for the construction of the new intake dam and reservoir —
on Manhan brook was tried in Hampshire County in June
and  was awarded him. This verdict was satisfactory to us, being about what we were willing to pay if the
case could be settled out of court.

In the opinion of the Board, more correct record is
given of the financial transactions for the year when no
unpaid bills are carried over and the department this year
in addition to cleaning up all the long standing claims

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD

against it has also paid for the bills contracted during the
month of November, which according to the usual custom
would not be paid until December and would then be considered in the accounts of the sucding year. The cash
balance therefore on hand at the close of the fiscal year
as given in this report represents the amount of money
actually available for such purposes as the department may
require.

Very little pipe extension was done during the year. |
There were only two requests for pipe extensions in districts not heretofore supplied. The gridiron system was |
so thoroughly strengthened in recent years that no replace- |
ment of mains was required during the past year and as a
result the total pipe extension for was the smallest in
the history of the department.

; We were of the opinion at the beginning of the year
that the price of cast iron pipe was bound to rise and purchased tons of such sizes as might be required for ordinary extensions at the very favorable price of 
per ton. Since then the price of pipe has doubled and railway shipments have become more uncertain but unless the
unexpected happens we have pipe enough on hand to more
than carry us through this year.

The principal feature of the construction work done

| by the department the past year was the erection of the
intake dam on the Manhan brook in Southampton, between
the White and Fomer Reservoirs. This dam was built by
the department’s own organization by the day and prac| tically completed although the progress of the work was
delayed somewhat on account of the searcity of labor. All
that now remains to be done to complete the work is the
finishing touches to the grading on the down stream side
and to the road leading from the dam to the highway.

The reservoir is now filled and will be put in operation
early in the season. The appropriation for this work was
$  but it will be done for less than that and it will
probably cost when completed about .

REPORT OF WATER BOARD  
The construction of this intake dam marks the completion of the project to increase the delivery of water from
the Fomer watershed into the Ashley reservoir and the
High Service reservoir which was first proposed in  
| and of which the extension of the inch main in  
was part. Nothing was done on this work during  
but the Board did not dare allow the matter to go over
another year. As the White reservoir appropriation was
exhausted and the costs of the litigation resulting from the
construction of the White dam amounting to about 
had to be paid out of the earnings from receipts in  |
the Board decided to issue bonds for the construction of
the new intake in the amount of  at to run
for period of five years to be paid in annual installments
of The elevation of the overflow of the new intake
is feet higher than that of the Fomer reservoir and  
feet higher than the spillway of the High Service reservoir.
The discharging capacity from the new intake into the High
| Service is three times as much as from the Fomer reservoir and the delivery into the Ashley reservoir is increased
by  |
By this new arrangement more of the storage of the
White reservoir is made available and the efficiency of the
  inch main from Fomer reservoir to our local reservoirs |
is increased million gallons yearly, or about  A
more detailed account of the advantages of this new project
is contained in the report of the Board for the year ending
Nov. ,
Nothing was done during the year in the matter of
strengthening the White Reservoir dam, except to observe
the recommendation of the expert engineers that it should
not be allowed to fill higher than feet below its spillway.
As it cannot be left in this condition indefinitely some start
on the necessary repairs ought to be made the coming year.
Negotiations have been completed for the purchase of |
the Delisle farm on the Fomer watershed, comprising  

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD
acres of land and two farm houses situated partly in Southampton and partly in Montgomery at price averaging
about  per acre. This property will be acquired for the :
protection of the watershed and is in line with the policy
of the Board in buying up such places when offered at a
bargain. |
: During the past year the Board has found it necessary
to be little more watchful of those who had successfully
in the past dodged the charges for automobiles and for the
use of garden hose. Less than half the automobile owners
were paying to this department the annual charge of 
claiming that their machines were being washed at the
garages, while at the same time no reasonably adequate
amount was being collected from the garages. Consequently the Board found it necessary to insist that the
annual charge of  be collected, no matter where the
| machine is washed. similar situation existed in the mat- i
ter of hose. So many water takers whose premises were
equipped with sill cocks for garden or lawn sprinkling
| would declare that they were not going to use hose for the
season and would later be detected doing so by our inspectors that the Board has made ruling that the annual
charge be made in all cases where the sill cocks are connected. These charges for automobiles and garden hose
. have been in force for many years and their impartial coltection is only justice to this department and to those
water takers who have always paid them.
The Board has established during the vear the new rule
that for all extensions of water mains at the request of petitioners in places not heretofore supplied, charge of one
dollar per front foot be made. The high cost of materials
and labor makes the cost of these extensions expensive and
the Board feels that part of it ought to be paid by the petitioner. It does not seem to the Board that extensions
are warranted at the expense of the department unless there
is reasonable expectation that the revenue from it will be
at least fair return on the money invested.

REPORT OF WATER BOARD 

The quantity of water required in the High Service
District on hot summer night to supply the demand for
lawn sprinkling over-taxes the capacity of the main from
the reservoir whjch is ample at all other times and reduces
the pressure in the district during the hours that sprinkling
is allowed. How this condition may be overcome and the
laying of an additional main from the ponds be delayed
until prices have gone back to nearer their normal level
is one of the things the Board will have to consider during the coming year.

The Department has been obliged during the year to
meet the increased cost of all the materials required in
the operation of water company and have also given a
general increase of about per cent to all of its emploves. While the work of the Department in other years
might have exded what was done for the vear just closed
in amount and in public interest, yet the settlement of all
the lawsuits, the construction of the new intake dam and
reservoir at Fomer, the transfer of  to the Sinking
Fund increasing our balance about  without raising
our charges for water rents and carrying over no unpaid
bills, all go to show that the past vear was successful one
and record which it gives us great satisfaction to render
to vou.

Mr. Jesse E. Sheldon retires this'vear from the Board |
after nine years of honorable service, four vears of which
he has served as Chairman, and we make public this expression of our appreciation of: his zealous interest in the
advancement of this Department, and we thank him, both
for ourselves and for the officers and employees of the Department, for the many acts of kindness and the unfailing
courtesy which he has always shown us.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT
To the Honorable Board of Water Commissioners.
Gentlemen :— !

I have the honor to submit to you the report. of your |
superintendent for the year ending November  th,  .

On account of the unusual conditions arising from the
war the high cost of materials and the scarcity of labor,
the main pipe extensions for the year were the smallest in
the history of the department. Only such extensions were
made as were required to supply houses built on newly
opened streets. There were no replacements of pipes in the
distribution system by pipes of larger size and in my opinion
there will be none required for the coming year. The loca| tion of the pipe laid during and the cost of the same
is given in table accompanying this report.

On several days during the summer season, for-an hour
or so, the pressure in the High Service district dropped to
a point lower than we would wish to have it. This was
caused by the large quantity of water required for hose
sprinkling purposes during the hours that this use is permitted. It is possible that some arrangement can cheaply
be effected which will temporarily remedy this condition,
although if this district continues to grow the carrying
capacity of the main from the reservoir must be increased.

Seventy-one new services were added during the year,
which is considerably less than the average for the three
vears preceding the war.

Seventeen new hydrants were installed at points designated by the Chief of the Fire Department, the locations
and cost of which are given later in this report.

The quality of the water during the year was satisfactory, few complaints being received. The quantity in stor, REPORT OF WATER BOARD  
age at the present time is about million gallons less than
this time last year, but the completion of the new Intake
Reservoir on the Manhan brook in Southampton which was
filled for the first time November  th, will more than provide for this deficiency during the coming year. The consructiom of this dam and reservoir was undertaken by
th Gepartment and practically carried to completion by
day Work by its own forces. The concrete dam and gate
hous were finished and the inch pipe line laid in  
was Xtended to connect with the gate house. All that
remnAINS to be done to complete the work is the removal of
some Stuamps from the reservoir basin, the repair of the
road leading from the highway to the site of the work
and the finishing touches to the grading.
The new pump and the Bag Ransome Bantam concrete mixer which were purchased for this particular work
will be kept by the department and will prove valuable in |
the many jobs that arise from time to time.
Five thousand white pine seedlings were set out on
the Ashley Ponds watershed during the past year and I
would recommend that this established policy of reforestratiom be continued and that white pines be
planted on the Ashley watershed and Whiting Street watershed during the coming year.  )
Thanking you for your hearty co-operation and unfailIng courtesy, this report is respectfully submitted.
PATRICK GEAR,
Superintendent. |
