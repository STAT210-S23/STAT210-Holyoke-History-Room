MAYOR'S ADDRESS.
Gentlemen of the Board of Aldermen:—

The aim of every municipal administration should be to
advance along the lines which will prove beneficial to the citizens. believe this has been the desire of all our various
municipal deparments during the past year. Working together
harmoniously as in the past and solving the new problems that
have been met, for the well-fare of all. This year again for the
fifth successive time the financial policy of not having our expenditures exd our income has been followed. Though it
sometimes requires us to do without improvements, yet city
as well as an individual does well to live within its income.

The report of our able City Auditor, D. W. Kenney, shows
again balance on hand at the close of our financial year.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT.

As the financial statement of the City Auditor is reported
in full each month and can be secured from him by any person
who desires to obtain it, will merely give the net bonded indebtedness of the city for the past six years. ,
Dec.  the net bond debt of the city was

 penditures for the Gas and Electric Department. This shows ,

during the past five years of about  and yet the many
improvements needed by our city have been made. During the
preceding five years, our net debt was increased .
The increase of December goo, was caused by the borrowing
of  for the erection of three schoolhouses and by the
expenditure of the Water Department of  taken from the
excess amount in its sinking fund. ‘The Water Department has
issued bonds for  this past year to complete its high
storage reservoir which should be finished this coming spring.
Our gross debt has also been increased this past year by the
issuing of  in serial bonds for the purchase of the
Gas and Electric plants. We were especially fortunate in selling
these bonds at premium of  though if sold six months
later we should have received  less, on account of the
stringency of the money market. ‘hese bonds have all been’ |
sold by the bankers who purchased them, notwithstanding
the stringent money market of the past year, showing the excellent financial standing now enjoyed by the City of Holyoke, and
in marked contrast with the situation five years ago.

The experience of our efficient city Treasurer, Mr. Pierre
Bonvouloir, was of great advantage to the city in floating this
issue of Gas and Electric bonds. ‘hese bonds are also payable
in annual installments so that the annoyance and risk of sinking fund is unnecessary. hope all our bonds in the future will
be issued on the serial plan as this also does away with the
temptation to slight the sinking funds in order to make good
financial showing. We will pay during this coming year ,
  in ten year bonds issued in  and the sinking fund com- |
missioners have the money now with which to pay them and |
have already retired large number of bonds of this issue by
purchasing them.

rate of State tax will not be maintained this year though under
our new corporation law which will effect us this year for the
first time the amount we will receive from corporations will
probably be considerably less than last year when it was  as against  five years ago. It is impossible to
estimate what the receipts from the State for the taxes on cor- .
porations will be this year. If the new corporation law had
taken effect last year we would have lost We

MUNICIPAL GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT.
The first report of the Gas and Electric Department is of
especial interest for we have the largest Municipal Gas and
Electric plant in the state. Notwithstanding the large price we
were compelled to pay and the large amount which the law requires us to charge off for depreciation (five per cent of the .
whole investment; or ), the manager is able to show a
small balance of on the right side. The manager, W. H.
Snow, has solved the difficult questions presented with an eye
solely to the best financial interests of the city and has had the
able assistance of Arthur W. Derby in the Electric Department
as well as the hearty co-operation of the employees of the two
plants. The problem of the Electric Department was especially
difficult. To keep the plant running and to take on new customers, although the limit of the capacity had been reached, especially when it was found that new electrical machinery could not
be secured for nearly nine months, was difficult proposition.
It was known before we secured the property that the electric
plant would demand entire reorganization. So we purchased

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS.

two kilowat generators of the most approved style and
which would utilize in full the sixteen mill powers of water to
which we are entitled. One of these generators is now running
and the other will soon be in place and yet the demand has been
so great that we should commence to plan for further increase.

 We cannot secure additional water power as our water plant has
reached its limit, so we will have to resort to steam unless the
plans of the Holyoke Water Power Company for utilizing their

 surplus power can be of assistance to us, but in that case the
power would have to be constant. Our electric plant will be
fully up to date when completed. We have increased the street
lighting capacity from arc lights to  The gas plant has
been increased by the addition of one bench, making ten benches of six retorts now in constant use. We will soon have to have
additional storage capacity for the gas and it would seem wise to commence to plan for it soon. It will be seen that these.
plants will require large expenditure and the most careful and
efficient management in order to be successful and trust this
will be appreciated by the public without being compelled to
suffer from some inefficient manager. These plants represent an |
investment of nearly one million dollars. Our gross receipts
from them last year were an increase of  over
the receipts of the Holyoke Water Power Company for  .

. This gross expenditure for running expenses and charges for
depreciation were showing surplus of which
has been expended in the additions to the plants. The total
additions made this past year to the plant have been ,
Of this amount,  was raised by the issue of bonds. There
does not seem to be any immediate prospect in the decrease of
the pricc of gas and electricity, though this will be taken up
with the Gas Commissioners as soon as the receipts will warrant.
We have paid our first installment of of bonds, which
amount was raised by taxation as the law requires. The cost
of our street lights last year was about  per lamp as
against  per lamp paid the Holyoke Water Power Company.

MAYOR’S ADDRESS. II
SCHOOLS.

The schools of our city have been kept up to their former
high standard of efficiency. It is certainly encouraging to note 
that while in the cost of this department was ,
this past year the cost has been or decrease of
$  while the average membership during that time has remained about the same, only having increased five, but in  
the total expenditure was but while the average mem- |
bership was pupils.

The per capita cost during the past year has been ,
as against  the preceding year. ‘The opening of new
parochial school by the Rev. Father D. F. McGrath has decreased the attendance in the East Dwight Street School so that
the building has been closed and the teachers transferred to
other schools. This is accountable for the increased per capita.
expense.

There has been harmony among the members of the
Board during the past year that augurs well for our schools.
The affairs of this department should be conducted without regard to political considerations and with the aim solely for the
best interests of the scholars. The High School has lost the
services of Mr. W. C. Akers, its efficient principal, and Mr. M.
M. S. Moriarty was elected to fill the vacancy, promotion
that has been earned by efficiency and experience. believe it
is advantageous so far as possible to give the preference to promoting our own teachers where it can be done without detriment
to the department. Mr. L. bP. Nash, our Superintendent, has
worked harmoniously with our efficient corps of teachers for the
success of our schools. It is well for the members of the School
Committee to keep watchful eye at all times on the expenditures to see that they do not again creep up to the amount ex- |
nended two years ago.
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

The opinion of our Police Department seems to differ according to the point of view. Some laxness in certain direc  MAYOR’S ADDRESS. |
tions seems to have crept in which must be remedied. The city
has been free from robberies and assaults of all kinds. Asa
| law abiding community Holyoke compares well with any city in ,
the State and when we read of some of the occurrences in other
Cities it is well for those who are over zealous in their desire to
criticise to note some of the good qualities of this department.
The enforcement of the laws relating to the sale of intoxicating
liquors continues to cause criticism in some quarters. During
, the past year this department was compelled to bring three
licensees before the License Commissioners who at once revoked two of the licenses and warned the third as the evidence
was not deemed strong enough to revoke that also. For time
the good effect of the action was evident but the tendency seems
to be again in the wrong direction and unless there is an improvement in certain lines there should be others brought
before the Commissioners. The law allows hotels to sell liquor
to guests at privileged hours and the holders of these licenses
cannot be too careful in their requirement of compelling guests
to observe the letter of the law. Any such who are suspected
of being too lax in that direction should be refused renewal of
 their privilege when the licenses are next granted if the evidence is insufficient to cause an immediate revoking of their
license. ‘Too great care cannot be exercised in this direction
and there is still room for improvement. recommend that the 
License Commissioners hold regular meetings at least once each 
month to act on matters pertaining to their department. Any
violations of law should be at once reported to the Marshal, for
the public are as much interested in violations as the Police '
Department and it. is only by successful co-operation of the
public that the best results can be obtained. ‘Io wait until an
election is about to take place before calling attention to any
laxness does not bring the best results. Our City Marshal is at
all times ready to receive any complaints and act on them. It
is well to remember that the criticism that is uttered is too
often actuated by other motives than those that are for the best
interests of the department or the city. believe that with the
thorough co-operation of the Police Department and License

MAYOR’S ADDRESS.  
| Commissioners during this coming year higher degree of effciency can be obtained in the enforcement of the law relating
to the sale of intoxicating liquor than we have had in the past,
but after all it is well to remember as Rev. Phillips Brooks said,
“All prohibitory measures are negative. That they have their
uses no one can doubt. That they have their limits is just as
clear ;” and as Rev. Dr. Henry Van Dyke recently said, “The
stronghold of intemperance lies in the vacancy and despair of
men’s minds. Make the life of your community cheerful and
pleasant and interesting, you reformers, provide men with
recreation which will not harm them if you want to take away
the power of the gilded saloon and the grimy boozing den.
Parks and playgrounds, libraries and music rooms, clean homes
and cheerful churches, these are the efficient foes of intemperance.”’

Our patrolmen are as efficient as in any city in the State.
The difficulties of their position are not realized by the public
at large, many of whom have the impression that the duties of
a policeman are easy and the responsibilities ight, but without
the hearty co-operation of the public at all times our police
, force could not be as effective. It is matter of congratulation
to all concerned that the strike of last summer passed over
without any violence. Four new patrolmen were added to the
force during the past year and certain sections of the city have
been provided with the police protection they requested. new
ordinance was also passed relating to salaries so that the new
officers receive  per year with an increase each year up

majority of cities in the State.

FIRE DEPARTMENT.

which our fire department has attained? With fires, there

only .

The permanent force has proven its efficiency and the department reflects great credit on the Commissioners as well as
upon its efficient members. The request for an increase in pay
was recognized and while the amount granted was not equal to
the amount asked for, believe the increase was appreciated.
During the coming year it may be possible to provide for new
central fire engine house to take the place of the present High
Street House if satisfactory arrangements can be made.

. BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.

The Board of Public Works have continued their permanent

improvements this year as far as their appropriation would
: permit. They have straightened the Springfield road in Spring- 

dale and raised the grade so that when completed it will be
above the highwater mark of the Connecticut River, and travel |
will not have to be discontinued when the river is high.
The work is being done gradually and the large amount of
filling required has been done at minimum of expense by utilizing the ashes from the mills and material from excavations so

. that the total expense will be about instead of ,
as first estimated. The Street Railroad Company will pay 
of this amount. Center, Summer, Sargeant and Hamilton
streets have been macadamized also. The culvert at Maple
street has been extended. Several petitions for new work have
not been granted because of lack of appropriations. The relaying of the paving on Main street should have immediate
attention this year, and the granite blocks taken from there
can be relaid on Appleton street and elsewhere as necessity
requires. |

The Board of Aldermen have requested the Street Railroad
Company to arrange for the laying of grooved rails on Main
street in order that this improvement there may not be delayed.
Suffolk street should receive attention and other streets as
needed.

MAYOR’S ADDRESS.  
BOARD OF HEALTH.

The members of this Department continue to look diligently after the health of our city and the general freedom from
any epidemic testifies to the efficiency of their work. The few
cases of smallpox were so diligently followed up that it was soon
stamped out.

WATER DEPARTMENT. :

The Water Department borrowed  by an issue of |
bonds this past year for the completing of their High Pressure
Reservoir. This will furnish additional pressure to the higher
parts of our city. The Board of Water Commissioners, with the
assistance of our efficient City Engineer, James L. Tighe, has
made careful study of the bad taste in our water, from which
we have suffered each spring, and find that it comes from
uraglena in Wright’s Pond. By so arranging the system of
supply it is now possible to shut off the pond from which the
trouble comes, and we should be freed from this pest next year,
which will be source of satisfaction to the citizens and matter of congratulation to the Department. Our water system is
excellent and our supply is so large that believe any attempt
to put the smaller water takers on metered service would not be
looked on with approval. The city departments paid this year
$  to the Water Department, while the Sinking Fund
Commissioner received from the Water Department, as tax,
$ but the department is now in such excellent financial condition that it can well afford to bear its share of the
city indebtedness. The gross receipts of this department last
year were about an increase over five years ago of
about .

PARK DEPARTMENT.

The Park Department is doing excellent work, and believe
is being much more fully appreciated by the people. Under the
able management of Mr. Charles E. Mackintosh and his associ  MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
ates, progress has been made along lines that will be permanent
benefit to the city. Canonchet Park in Ward One has received
needed improvements. Elmwood Park has received attention,
and the coming year should show development of the plans
that have been mapped out, so that the great benefit to be deOO rived from Elmwood Park will commence to appear. An increased appropriation should be given this department in order
that its broad policy of advancement can be carried out. The
report of this department shows that the Commissioners are
thoroughly up to date in their ideas relating to parks, and that
they are building along broad lines.
LEGAL DEPARTMENT.
The work in the Legal Department increases with the ad' vance of the city. The routine work is greater than is appreciated by the majority of our citizens. Our able City Solicitor,
N. P. Avery, Esq., has looked after the duties required in his
usual careful and conscientious manner. The famous Lyman
Mills case, started in  has been advanced another stage,
and the Superior Court has affirmed the finding of the Assessors
for the year  ‘There are six other petitions of abatement
of their taxes brought by the Lyman Mills. trust with the
judgment of the Court taken as basis some satisfactory disposition of the remaining cases can be made. The City Solicitor in
this case had the valuable assistance of W. H. Brooks, Esq. The
hearings have been held on the claim of Thomas W. Mann for
expert services, and auditor’s finding should not be much longer
delayed. The City Solicitor’s Report shows that our total expenditure for verdicts and settlements the past year of all cases
 brought—except one, case for taking land in the Water De partment—has been but certainly an exceptional showing. The other minor cases can be found in the City Solicitor’s
Report.

CITY ENGINEER’S DEPARTMENT.

Our competent City Engineer, Mr. James L. Tighe, with
his assistants, have performed the work of the City Engineer’s
Department in the usual careful manner. While no large public
improvements have been undertaken, the routine work required
has taken all their time. The wisdom of combining the duties
of the City Engineer and the Engineer of the Water Department
has long ago been demonstrated, and the city is some 
better off in the past four years for this arrangement.

OVERSEERS OF THE POOR.

The Overseers of the Poor have faithfully performed their
duties. They have enlarged the Chapel at the Almshouse, so
that all can now be accommodated. ‘The expense per capita
was about cents per day, and the total net expense to the
city was .

The other departments have continued to work for the best
interests of the people, and am sure their efforts are appreciated, the more so from the fact that no public criticism was

REPORT OF
FIRE COMMISSIONERS.
* OFFICE OF FIRE COMMISSION,
Hotyokr, Mass., Dec. 
Lo the Honorable Mayor and City Council :

GENTLEMEN :—In accordance with the requirements of the
City Ordinance your Board of Fire Commissioners present their
report for the year ending December .

The Board organized January by the election of
Charles L. Newcomb as chairman, D. J. Landers as vice-chairman, and John Hildreth as secretary. Your Commissioners
have held eighteen formal meetings and many informal meetings
during the past year.

There have been fires and alarms during the past year,
with the total damage to buildings and contents of .
Of this amount  was paid by insurance companies,
leaving net loss to our citizens of Average loss per
fire above insurance  more detailed account of the
fires and losses will be found under the head of fires and alarms.

This is the second year of the permanent fire department,
and careful examination of the splendid work done by our
firemen will satisfy, we think, the most critical that the change
was good one. Among the most serious fires which we have
had during the past year were the following:—Marble Hall fire,
upon which there was loss of “This was very diffcult fire to handle, but the Commissioners are satisfied that the

!
  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.

Department did splendid work in saving this building. It
seemed from the very first as if the entire building was doomed,
but the men worked so skillfullyunder the direction of the Chief |
that the loss in this building was, under the circumstances, ex- .
dingly small. Two firemen were injured in an explosion of
gas, which resulted in the blowing out of the plate glass fronts,
the heavy glass cutting them quite severely. The fire at Chase |

. Cooledge was very serious fire, but was splendidly handled,
and resulted in loss only of .

| Lightning injured the house of Alexander McAuslan to the
amount of and quick as the Department is to respond to
alarms, lightning is very much quicker, and this damage was
practically done before the Department reached the scene of |
the fire. .

. The fire at the Powers Paper Co., occurring as it did near

midnight, offered splendid opportunities for big loss, and that ,
the loss was only  is matter for congratulation.

The fire of the Springfield Blanket Co.’s Mill, which resulted |
in loss of was controlled by the Company, and the |
Department were not called to attend this fire. ,

We again ask for our firemen, when responding to alarm, |
the assistance of all citizens in keeping clear the streets, so that
the firemen may not have to turn out when they are hurrying to
a fire. ‘Their mission is one which can permit no delay, and |
oftentimes the slightest delay would mean the loss of life and |
thousands of dollars worth of property.

We have again to record the loss of human life by fire. ,
Miss Tottier, Mrs. Arsino and Mrs. Gately were burned so seriously that they died. There were other cases of injury, but |
fortunately did not result fatally. Five of our firemen received
serious injuries during the past year, viz:—Joseph N. Riley, |
Patrick J. Rohan, John Welch, John J. Fenton, Daniel McLean |
and James Long. The last named came very near losing his
life. ‘The injuries to all of the above persons were of serious
nature, and the men will carry with them through life the marks |
of their injuries. This only illustrates the dangerous nature of |
the occupation of fireman.

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.  !

We have equipped considerable of the apparatus of the Department with rubber tires, which makes them very much safer,
and will add, we believe, greatly to their efficiency. We think
that in the coming year all the hose wagons and engines should
have this much needed improvement.

The telephone is very important auxiliary to the Department, and we take pleasure in testifying to the excellent service
of our local telephone company. little delay in getting the
message of fire iS serious matter.

The Commissioners feel that they can again congratulate

- our citizens on the outcome of the last year’s Fire Department
work, and while the Department necessarily calls for very
considerable expenditure of money, we believe that careful |
examination of this report would satisfy all that the money has
been well expended. We are very glad to bear testimony in this
report to the splendid work of the Department, under the able
direction of Chief Lynch, and we believe that the splendid
courage and the efficient work of both the officers and men in
the pursuit of their difficult and dangerous duties calls for our
highest commendation, which we gladly give to them.

We again thank the Honorable Mayor and Board of Aldermen for their liberal treatment of the Department in the matter
of appropriations, and we have expended the money appropriated
for our use so as to get the best possible results; and we make
the following recommendations, and trust that they may not be
overlooked, but that you will give them that consideration which
they deserve.

first. We recommend that new engine house be erected
to replace House No. on High street. We have urged the
purchase of lot of land for number of years, but the various
Boards of Aldermen have failed to appropriate money necessary
for such action. Last year the Board of Fire Commissioners and
the Board of Public Works were given authority to obtain options

. on lots for new engine house and report back to the Board of
Aldermen. This we have done, but the Board took no action
on this matter. The lots available for this purpose are limited,
and as the city grows the difficulty of obtaining suitable lot

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.

grows also, and we again earnestly recommend that an appropriation be made this year to enable the Commissioners, together
with the Board of Public Works, to purchase lot south of
Appleton street, and that steps be taken to dispose of the
present house. It can be sold for very large sum, as it is desirable as site for business block, and can be easily changed
over, so as to become suitable for business purposes.

Second, We again report our recommendation of the last
three years that House No. should be enlarged in accordance
with the plans of our City Engineer, and that the extension
should be placed on the west side. ‘This house has been too
small for long time past; there is not room enough for apparatus or horses.

Third. Yor many years we have recommended that House
No. should be sold, and new modern tire engine house be
erected nearer the center of the ward. We make this recommendation once more, and as the ward is building up so fast, a
lot should be purchased as soon as possible.

Fourth, Weagain repeat our recommendations that Engine
No. should be overhauled and equipped with new boiler,
which will make it an up-to-date machine. It has been in active
service for some years, and has to protect an exdingly
important part of the city. .

fifth, We recommend the rebuilding of Hose Wagons Nos.
  and on the same lines as Hose Wagon No.  ‘This change
gives seats for the men to sit upon, and makes very much safer
and desirable piece of apparatus.

Sixth, We again recommend that ten-circuit repeater be
put in the Fire Alarm Department. We have outgrown the
present repeater, and it is not good business to continue its use
much longer.

Seventh. The matter of improved service for the Highland
and Elmwood Fire Departments should engage the attention of
the Board of Water Commissioners, and we urge that all the
benetits of the high level service be given to these two districts
as soon as possible.

vice for seventeen years, and should be repaired as per our recommendations. We have rebuilt Hose Wagons Nos. and  as
they were not strong enough to carry the permanent men, side
seats and rubber tires make them much safer for the men; we
have also made extensive repairs on Engine No. and Aerial
Truck No.  Hose Wagons Nos. and should be rebuilt in |
same lines as Hose Nos. and  The apparatus now in active
service consists of six steam engines, two doubletank chemical ,
engines, one combination hose and chemical wagon, five twohorse hose wagons, one aerial truck, one hook and ladder truck, |
one three-horse dispatch wagon, seven exercise and supply
wagons, one chief’s buggy, one reserve engine, twenty-one three
gallon chemical extinguishers, one superintendant of fire alarm
- wagon, three sleighs, and one automobile.
|
HORSES. |
We have forty-one horses in the Department and in spite |
of the very best care given to them, our experience has shown us
that in all probability number of these horses will have to be
replaced during the coming year. We were obliged to purchase ,
. during the past year, eight new horses and until some form of
horseless carriage can be devised for use in the Fire Departmen, this branch of our service will continue to be expensive. |
We have examined number of improved horseless carriages |
during the past year, but have not been able to find anything as
yet that, in our opinion meets the severe requirements of the
Fire Department, but with the improved motors that are now !
being made, it would seem as though success would soon be
reached in this direction.
HAY AND FEED.
We have the usual quantity of hay, bedding and feed on
hand.
HOUSES.

ments that are necessary in our recommendations, to which we
earnestly call attention.

HOSE. |
We have purchased during the past year feet of new
hose. For the last few years we have been buying higher
grade of hose than heretofore and our experience has been that
in the long run, it is more profitable to buy good grade of
hose rather than cheap grade. We have in the department
the following hose, viz :—

FIRE ALARM TELEGRAPH.
During the past year we have put in two new Fire Alarm
' Boxes, viz:—Box No.  at the corner of High and Dwight
streets, Box  at the Highland school house. ‘There has been
only few changes in this Department during the past year, but
in the near future we shall probably be obliged to put the wires |
in the thickly settled portions of our city, underground. Publec
safety will necessitate this being done, the liability of damage
to the overhead system is too great to be continued much longer.
The success of our Department depends very largely upon the
prompt and efficient working of the Fire Alarm system. failure of this system to work might result in very serious loss,
both of life and property, and as we depend upon this system
almost entirely now for the giving of alarm for fire, we must do
everything possible to protect and perfect this branch of our
service. The Superintendent of this Department is to be com  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.

D. W. KENNEY,
City Auditor.

The past year has been an exdingly busy one with us,
the work of building the new dam at High Service Reservoir,
and the laying of new twenty inch main from the Fomer pipe
line at the lower end of Ashley Pond to the gatehouse at Wright
Pond, connections being made with the High Service and Bray
Reservoirs, were the principal matters claiming the attention of
the Board.

Permission was obtained from the Legislature on May rsth
to borrow  for the work at the High Service Reservoir,
which loan your honorable Board authorized the City Treasurer
to procure, and bonds for that amount, payable in ten years and
bearing per cent interest, were duly issued by him and the
prods turned over to this department.

The work, which had already been commenced at the new
reservoir, was now pushed, the force employed being augmented
to men and teams, and later to nearly men and  

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.
teams, in order that as much of the work as possible might be
done this year.

The work at the reservoir was continued as long as the
weather permitted.

The dam is of the earthen type, with rubble concrete core.

Good progress was made with the work, the dike on the
southwest side being completed and the core wa!l of the main
dam raised to within nine feet of high water mark, the earthen
embankment being built up to within two feet of the present
level of this wall, which leaves nine feet more of the core wall
and about sixteen feet more of the earthen embankment yet to
be built.

It is the incention of the Board to complete the dam and
also finish cleaning out the basin of the reservoir the coming
year.

The County Commissioners made visits of inspection to the

 High Service Reservoir during the progress of operations and
were well satisfied with the work there.

The amount spent on the High Service Reservoir the past
year was |

The new inch main was laid from the Fomer pipe line at
the lower end of Ashley Pond and connected with the inch
main leading from Wright Pond, distance of feet, a
double connection being made with the new reservoir and a
single one with the Bray Reservoir.

The new main was part of the original plan in connection
with the building of the High Service Reservoir, but the idea of
arranging the pipes and gates so that the water from the Fomer
line, or from the High Service or Bray Reservoirs can be fed
directly into the pipes leading to the city was new, and resulted
from investigations of the City Engineer and the Board in connection with the disagreeable odor and taste of the water from the

| REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
Ashley Pond supply, which was noticeable for few weeks in the
spring of the year.

From the tests made the Board were convinced that the
trouble came from certain minute organisms known as uroglena,
and which were found in considerable numbers in Wright and
Ashley Ponds, none being found in the Bray, Tannery or Fomer
Reservoirs This led to the arranging of the pipe and valves as
stated above. It is now our intention tocut off the Wright and
Ashley supply when the troublesome uroglena makes its appearance there, usually for couple of weeks in the spring of the
year, and draw from the new reservoir, when it is completed, or
from the Fomer line and Bray Reservoir direct until the trouble
is Over. ,

The pipe line was completed on October  and test of
the same was made at High Service Reservoir on November  ,
on which occasion the water flowed from pipe raised to an
elevation equal with that of the overflow at the Fomer Reservoir.

The cost of the new main was approximately .

The dike which crosses Wright Pond little north of the
gatehouse was raised about six feet, thereby better protecting
the pipe laid through it and cutting off portion of the pond
which did not look entirely wholesome, the water from which
must now filter through the dike before it becomes part of the
supply entering the city mains.

Seventy-six feet of  -inch and two hundred and forty-four

- feet of  -inch pipe were laid in Brook street, from Grant street
west, distance of three hundred and twenty feet in all.

Several pieces of land bordering on Wright and Ashley
Ponds, High Service and Whiting Street Reservoirs were purchased during the year, in order to better protect the waters
from possible contamination.

| REPORT OF WATER BOARD.

Our office has been greatly improved by the changes made
at the beginning of the year.

The receipts from water rents were an increase
of  over those of the previous year.

REPORT OF
SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
To his Honor the Mayor and the Citizens of Holyoke:

The School Committee respectfully submit their annual report for the year nineteen hundred three. The various sub-committees have presented their statements, with review of the
year’s work and suggestions for the future; and from these various departments the most important recommendations are
incorporated here.

The high school is moving prosperously, with increased
attendance. Some valuble improvements have been made in
the system of ventilation; we have further to recommend that
the work of tinting the walls of the rooms be extended throughout the building. new department has been added to the
work of the school, including voca! culture, and physical culture

) for girls. We believe that much more attention should be
paid to physical culture in all our schools for both boys and
girls. The development of strong and healthy bodies should be
the first object of the school.

Some additions to the heating system have been made at
the Highland building, and we hope for some further things, including the removal of the gas engine. Owing to the opening
of the large school of the Parish of Our Lady of the Rosary, it
was found that the West street building could accommodate all
the public school pupils of that neighborhood. We have therefore three buildings in the First Ward, which have been closed
and turned over to the care of the Board of Public Works. ‘The

| |
vas

(ie natural growth of the city however will soon send in more :
| te children than that one building should contain; and it is our exHite pectation that in no very long time it will be necessary to r
i it re-open one at least of these buildings. At South Holyoke on
i Bie the other hand, the buildings are crowded. It does not seem
| Hh practicable to send pupils over to Ward One, and our exper- |
Any iences in this matter are not different from those of other cities. |
) Ht ih In some places the expedient has been tried, of building small |
 es temporary houses on the play-grounds of crowded buildings. If .
i) He no longer needed, these can be carried elsewhere. ;
at The Park street building certainly ought to be provided
| hid with an additional exit. If fire should be started in that
nt Bel building near the door, or if by some accident to the tower the
Heh |) present doorway should be blocked up, there might be terrible
ay ji consequences. ‘The Elm street building has now as many pupils
, ti ik as it can accommodate; it is time that the central offices of the
| lh school department should be located elsewhere. The City ,
. Ae should provide separate building, so planned as to furnish
| ae suitable rooms for the school committee, with offices and supply
a rooms, so that the work can be properly and economically done.
a The City now owns suitable lot of land, just south of the Elm
Hy street building.

ee Our evening schools continue to grow, especially in the

  number of pupils who attend by choice, and not by legal rei quirement. It is highly desirable that young people should be
encouraged to spend cheir evenings at school; and to this end, |
| we ought to build up the work of these schools, especially the |

“ihe evening grammar school. An evening high school will be necWat essary in the near future.  

ee In the department of Manual Training, our city has not yet

  complied with the law which requires such training in the elemen| tary schools of cities having over twenty thousand inhabitants.

| The committee should take steps to carry onthis work,and probab| ly the first step should be to send ninth grade boys to the high

t school building, one afternoon of each week, for instruction in

: wood-working. Meantime if thought best, the girls should ret ceive instruction in sewing and dress-making. Two additional

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE. |
teachers would be needed, at cost of about fifteen hundred
dollars year. |

Our city is now fairly well supplied with kindergartens, and
we feel that they are doing valuable work. The little children
come to the kindergartens from different homes, with very different surroundings, but they all learn to play together and
work together, under the sweet and kindly influence of the
kindergarten. They are learning their first lessons in that
cooperation and mutual helpfulness which make most important element in good citizenship.

The Committee on Printing and Supplies have held regular
meetings and have kept careful watch over expenditures. The
city can well afford to pay for all the supplies that can properly
be used; but it cannot afford one cent for waste. The lesson of .
economy in the use of material is good lesson for all our
children to learn. It may be as useful as the other lessons of
the curriculum. An account of the expenditures for each school,
and for each department of study will be found among the statistical figures in the report of the Superintendent.

The school department has prospered during the past year.
There is harmony and cooperation among the different parts of
the department, and where such is the case good results are |
assured. ‘Che people of our city appear to have confidence in
the management of the schools, and while in some cities there
isa good deal of uneasiness and criticism about the conduct of
the schools and the finances, we have no such troubles here. The
expense per capita has been moderately and steadily reduced for
several years past in Holyoke. few years ago, there was but
one city in the Commonwealth where it cost as much per year
to educate child at school, as it cost in Holyoke. ‘The cost
for the last complete school year was thirty-two dollars, thirtyeight cents nine mills per capita, which shows an important
Saving when compared with the figures of few yearsago. We
believe that this economy has been effected without lowering in
any way the standard of work in our schools. Our total expenditure for the .last fiscal year was including 
charged for water, but which was provided for by credit at City

|  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
| Hall. For the next year, we recommend an appropriation of
| If the charge for water is provided for as last year,
this may be reduced to It will be seen that the sum
| recommended is somewhat smaller than last year’s income.

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
ATTENDANCE.

The published figures of attendance relate to the last completed school year, ending in June  ‘Ihese figures are
smaller than for the preceding year, and further decrease will
be noted when the figures come to be published for the school
year ending in June  It is the first time for several years
that the schools of Holyoke have failed to show considerable
increase in membership. It is due of course to the opening of
the large parochial school connected with the Parish of Our
Lady of the Rosary. We have now three buildings in that
neighborhood which have been closed. However, it appears to
be the opinion of those qualified to judge, that population will
continue to grow steadily in that section, and that before very
long the buildings will be needed again. For the present all
the pupils are sufficiently accommodated in the West street
building. few years ago the Committee moved the Kindergarten out of the West street building to Dwight street, so that
the little children need not climb the hill. But for some reason
the Kindergarten never flourished at Dwight street. Now that
it has been moved back to West street, membership has quickly
increased. Attendance in other sections of the city has increased
at about the normal rate, in harmony with the growth of the general population.

MANUAL TRAINING.

This subject has been brought several times to the attention
of the Committee, but no action has hitherto been taken. In
my judgment, the scope of the manual training work at the
High School should be enlarged, and the work should be extended to lower grades. Manual training is not valuable solely,
or chiefly, by way of instructing people in those handicrafts by
which they may earn livelihood. It has its place in the
schools and is rapidly growing in favor, because as factor in
general education, it contributes powerfully to the development
of intellectual advancement and moral character. ‘The brain

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
and nervous system of the human race have been evolved by
doing things, in response to stimulus from without. Our school
methods require children to sit still and learn lessons, restraining
the inclination to activity. This has its great value of course,
but it is artificial and incomplete. It was all very well in the
old farming days, when boys and girls got plenty of positive
education in doing things at home. The school was looked to )
for the literary side of education purely. But in our modern
city life, there is small chance for children to develop the power
of doing things with their hands, of making things, of bringing
something to pass by their own constructive labor. The school
cannot wholly meet the need, but it could do something towards
it; we have in Holyoke very little of such work below the High
School. One result is, that the schools sometimes lose their hold
upon the very strongest, most enterprising pupils. boy of
superabundant physical energy, who needs chance to use his
muscles, is apt to lose interest in school, where he can do nothing
but sit still and study lessons. He plays truant, is brought before the Court, sent to the truant school. At the County Truant
School he works in the shop and on the farm; he delights in
such work, and he does better in book-studies, because both
sides of his nature are being developed. We have always found

‘that boys who are incorrigible with us are perfectly tractable at
the truant school. ‘They have chance to work olf their physical energy in productive labor, and then they are ready to study.
The real needs of the boy’s nature are being met. ‘The fault in
many of these cases rests with the school-system. We have sent
a boy to the truant school and branded him asa “hard case,”’
when the trouble might all have been avoided if we had given
him chance at school to do the work which his energetic boynature demanded. lor every possible reason then, we ought
at once to extend the manual training to all our grades. ‘The
first step should be, to send the boys of the ninth grade to the
High School for wood-working. It would be necessary to buy
some more tools, and to provide teacher. We already need
some of the time of an additional teacher at the High School to
help Mr. McDonald. It would be possible for teacher to give

ft this help, and also do the work with the boys of the ninth grade.
. At the same time, the girls might study sewing, preferably at
a the High School building. |

| DEPARTMENT BUILDING. |
i oO It is time that the city should take up the matter of pro- !

| Hi and the administration of the schools is handicapped by adverse |
: i} ai condtions. We have not good place for supplies, and our ar| i) rangements are such that it costs good deal more to handle the |
hi if supplies than it ought. We have to handle good many tons of
| it material; people are slow to realize the magnitude of the business
  of the School Department. It is not economy in any business

! Our high school continues to grow in numbers and in use, WV fulness. ‘The building is an excellent one, and will be adequate
Ue to the needs of the school for years to come. We have every
| ie reason to be grateful to those who planned it. It has been proa posed to take out the fixed furniture from the floor of the audi, torium, and substitute movable seats, thus better fitting the
! Ae room for the social uses of the school and the alumni. These
; oh social gatherings make really valuable feature of life at school,
: vant) and delightful remembrance in later years. It would be much
tal better if the schoolhouse could be the center for all such gathHr erings, as for all that has to do with the life of the school.
he We may expect to see considerable growth in the depart, ments of sciences, of commercial education, and of manual
| training. In fact the manual training department is now deHi manding another teacher, and there is growing call for the
a department to broaden its work so as to include some work
} with metals.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  

We have at the school good number of objects of art,
pictures and statues, to which additions are made every year by
gifts from classes or school organizations. The school is to be
congratulated upon the spirit that moves to these gifts, as well
as upon the admirable taste that has been shown in their selection.

Pupils enter our high school at rather early age as
compared with some high schools, and they usually complete
the course in four years, although five years is demanded in
some good schoos. ‘This has the etfect of sending our young
people to college at somewhat earlier age than they go from
some cities. If it appears later that they hold their ground
well, then there will have been valuable saving. The chief care
and responsibility of public high school however, is not for
those who go to higher institutions, but for that larger number
who cannot goto any higher institution, but must complete
their school education with us. ‘The high school has been .
rightly called the “People’s College.” We ought by all means
to make its courses so broad and thorough, its influence so helpful and stimulating, that it may truly bring something of the
spirit of liberal culture to all its pupils. Moreover it should be

' strongly urged upon boys and girls that they go to the high
school. If they cannot complete the course, then let them go
for year. It is of inestimable importance to the life of our
city that these young people, so soon to be responsible citizens,
should mingle with all the rest of those of like age in the city,
in the hopeful, happy life of the high school. It is broader, freer
than the grammar school, and it broadens the horizon of young
people, outside the lines of their own district.

The plan of free election of studies as carried on in our
school is acomplete success. Every one of the fancied objections
disappears on trial. Pupils do not elect “soft snaps,’ they do
not take ‘one-sided courses,” they do not do any of the dreadful things that were prophesied. By careful and intelligent consultation of the teachers with the pupils and their parents,
there is brought about hearty cooperation in the selection of
subjects, and an intelligent study of the educational value of

Oi BEAUTIFYING THE SCHOOL ROOMS. |
a
Oe In the artistic adornment of school-rooms, Holyoke has |
  Fe tf much to be grateful for. The fine collection of pictures, casts
i) and specimens in natural history which Mr. Lawrence has gath- ‘fF
| lh ered at the Appleton street building has long been famous. The
) i}, principal of the Highland school has provided so large and rich
| (iy  collection that very wide notice has been attracted, and Mr.
| Hi Callahan has been invited from far and near to tell the people ,
| en about his collections and his methods of procedure. Miss :
| Nea Lawley at Elm street, Miss Morgan at Sargeant street, Mr.
hh Lynch at West street, Mr. Judd at !familton street and num| erous Other principals as they have the opportunity, are bring| ing in good pictures and other objects of art. All of this is edu| if cational work of very high order of excellence. It gives the
| ae children thoughts and ideals which are beyond and above the |
) mere task-work of the school lessons, and which will be source |:
: of inspiration and appreciation throughout their lives.
Mea EVENING SCHOOL.
Our system of evening schools continues to grow in imi portance. Our Massachusetts law forbids the employment of a
yy minor who cannot read and write English, unless he or she ati tends anevening school. ‘The number of such illiterates in Hol: yoke is steadily decreasing and the schools are filling up with
people who are not obliged to attend the evening school, but who
! come from choice. This fact should be cause of profound gratiREPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
fication. It speaks well for the future of Holyoke when hundreds
of young people, and these numbers rapidly growing, will give
up the pleasure of their evenings, and after hard day’s work
will turn to study in the evening schools. It shows ambition
for the better things of life that is almost beyond praise.

But these young people will not come to the evening
schools unless they feel that they are receiving the help and inspiration which they need. An increasing burden is laid upon
us, to provide strong teachers, sufficient equipment, wide
range of studies, and in every possible way to foster the spirit
that is shown by these hard-working pupils. The evening grammar school under its efficient principal Mr. Garvey, has done
splendid work in preparing the way. We ought at once to
organize an evening high school, and offer such choice of high
school subjects as may be called for.

There have been several changes in the corps of teachers,
of which the most noticeable is the retirement of Mr. J. J.
Keane, who had been associated with the Chestnut street
evening school for long term of years, and who resigned because of the pressure of other civic duties.

IN GENERAL.

The work of our schools has been carried along during the .
year without friction, and upon the whole in manner that is
creditable to our teachers. We have not sought to introduce
startling changes, but to continue along well-understood paths
of successfull work. Principals and teachers understand well
their respective duties; all have confidence that there will be
substantial support from the committee, with freedon to work
along the best lines, in reasonable assurance that good work
will be recognized. In the First Ward there were several rooms
closed owing to diminished attendance, and of course there
was some anxiety on the part of the teachers interested. All
that matter has been arranged satisfactorily by the Committee,
and our teachers are much helped in their work by the feeling
that there is peace in the department.

My personal relations with all the members of the School
Department have been most satisfactory, and have again to
thank the members of the Committiee for support and friendly
consideration.

MANUAL TRAINING.

The work in manual training is hindered by lack of teaching force. The number of pupils electing this work has
grown far beyond the ability of one man to handle them effectively. Many of the classes are far larger than they should be.
The classes in mechanical drawing are twice as large they
should be. An assistant in this department is an imperative
need.

HISTORY.

The study of United States history should be given the
place of honor in public high school. ‘This study properly
conducted should have the highest formative value for citizenship. Every graduate of public high school should be thoroughly instructed in the meaning of popular government and
should understand the grand privilege to which he is born. The
study of the origin and growth of our own government supplies
the required meaning. Proficiency in this department should
be an absolute requirement of every candidate for diploma.

The course should include survey of the movement which
led to independence, its achievement, its influence on later like
movements and on governments in general, its natural sequence
in th Civil war, brief view of constitutional development, and
aview of the result of national growth on national character.
As our nation had its origin in the aspiration of men for freedom, that origin is more clearly appreciated in the light of the

| other great movements for human freedom; these should be
Aye studied for the sake of making our own history clearer. As
Ke bearing on this, other historic periods should be studied in the
f el same spirit as attesting the constant desire of men towards |
j ih freedom and brotherhood. Not the despotic conqueror seeking
HB selfish aggrandizement over the bodies of his fellowmen should
  be the central theme in the study of historic period in the
Bit schools of free republic; rather, in keeping with republican |
  be ideals, is the exaltation of the toiler, and the servants of men.
Hay No period of history is devoid of interest concerning the pro- |
af gress of human activity. The ideals to be kept before our i
| By young people eternally are not the men who have ascended :
i Ht he over the prostrate bodies of their fellows, but those who have
| fi helped to lift up the race, the men of unselfish devotion and
|  service. In this way and in no other can our future citizens be
| Be trained to enter fitly into their incomparable inheritance.
! ta li teaching of history sympathetic with this view of its
ae place requires that adequate provision be made in teaching force.
| eae There is no course in history that should be given into the
H hands of teacher who has not had specific training for that
: ian work. The practical application to our own school is that
| ie another teacher trained for the work should be added to the ;
| department of history the coming year. |
| WG
| ATHLETICS. f
| Physical exercise is need of growing boys and girls.
| Systematic regulation of physical exercise is not yet part of
our school system. It is natural consequence that pupils, in
} particular boys, should organize for the support of those forms
\ of physical exercise which have in them the possibility of ex| citement necessary to satisfy the cravings of their age. In this
way have grown up the baseball, football, basketball, and track
teams which are found in all high and other secondary schools.
All of these are organized in our school and have one central
} athletic association to which they are financially and adminisi tratively responsible.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
One objection to the forms of school athletics in vogue is
that they are in some degree extra hazardous. In particular
this objection is made to football. Another objection is that
school athletics are two distractive, taking the thought too
much from school work. ‘There sometimes appears to de basis
to the objection that the handling of large sums of money by
boys gives opportunity for dishonesty. On the side of the
school administration is the objection that, as at present conducted, too few participate; the benefit is limited to few.
The objection to football because it is extra-hazardous has
some foundation. On the other hand it can be said that football
supplies an excitement and demands vigor of effort such as
are very desirable for young men of secondary school age. As
at present played it demands too long sustained effort and allows
too severe collisions. It is too good sport to abandon, and
it seems incumbent on the experts in athletics to recommend
those modifications which, while not taking from the game its
attractiveness, will reduce the period of sustained ettort and
will bar the massing of so many players at one point. With
these changes football should be desirable form of physical
exercise.
The argument that school athletics are distractive has had
some weight, and still has some. The Holyoke High School,
in common with those of the vicinity, has tried for the last few
years to adjust the balance between work and play by requiring
that all participants in inter-school athletic contests be doing
satisfactorily the major part of course necessary for graduation. This regulation has raised the standard of school athletics
and the character of the work done by those participating, in
all of the schools observing this agreement. In one school it
has been demonstrated that it is possible to require that all of the course work be carried satisfactorily. The other schools
in the agreement are considering raising the requirement to this
standard, which seems entirely feasible and Just.
The handling of money should be good discipline for any
young man. Large sums are handled anuually by the managers ,
of the Herald, the school paper, and every cent is properly ac  *

| a) ae counted for. The same satisfactory handling of the finances of
iH the athletic teams is possible and is being surely and steadily
| i} on reached. Any shortcomings of the past have been due to lack
| Hil of judgment in making schedules, thereby entailing losses which
| af ae there was nomoney to meet. These losses were then defaulted inif it stead of met in manly fashion. Under the present regulation of
| athletic finances, which has been in force for three years, |
Bia)! ae these possibilities are largely obviated.
i ie It is to be hoped that in the ideal future physical exercise
it oi will have its proper place in every school curriculum. If it is |
he it the proper function of the school to inform the mind, it is as

ty properly its function to see that there is proper vehicle for
mi that mind, sound body. Assuming that each home in that )

l He if provide the physical training necessary to develop that body |

REPORT OF THE PRINCIPAL
OF THE

EVENING GRAMMAR SCHOOL.
Mr, Louis P. Nash, Superintendent of Schools:

Acting upon your suggestion, beg to submit few facts
relative to branch of the school work toolittle known to
the people of our city, that is, the work of the Evening Grammar School. |

The need of this school had long been felt by young men
and women who were obliged for various reasons to leave the
day schools before completing their ninth grade work, and who
cherished desire to receive the benefit of at least grammar
school education. ‘The school is now entering upon its seventh
year and has been success from its very beginning. While
attendance of the pupils is wholly voluntary, some idea of the
interest manifested can be gained from the fact that our present
enrolment is  and the average attendance during the year
Just passed was per cent. ‘The question of discipline has
never entered into the running of the school, as the pupils are
of high degree of intelligence, and the order is perfect.

Since the first year of the school’s existence young men
and women have been awarded diplomas for completing ninth
grade work and scores of others have received material assistance by being promoted to positions commanding better wages
as result of their efforts.

But the work of the evening school does not stop here;
Something should be done for these pupils who graduate year

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
after year. The Evening Grammar School furnishes only a
stepping stone to higher and better things. We take our graduates to the door of the High School and there we leave them.
Of these graduates it is safe to say that at least per cent
of them would gladly welcome the opportunity of further advancement in High School work, but up to the present the Committee has not seen fit to afford it except, in measure, by introducing afew advanced courses in this school which have
- been very successful although greatly handicapped.
This seems hardly fair to the poor fellow who toils all day
for his very existence and has only the night for his own, and I
trust the time is not far distant when the evening school system
of this city will be so complete that every working boy and girl
may have equal privileges with their more fortunate friends in
the day school. ‘To such an end, would recommend that the
present term of nights be extended to or and so give
us chance to do more thorough work; that the evening
schools be more thoroughly advertised throughout the city, and
‘ that the Committee as whole or individually visit the school
often, for evening school pupils labor under many disadvantages
and should be encouraged in their struggle for an education.
Respectfully submitted,
Pp. J. GARVEY.

REPORT OF THE :
BOARD OF HEALTH.
Zo the Honorable the Mayor, and Board of Aldermen.

GENTLEMEN :—In compliance with the Public Statutes, the
Board of Health herewith respectfully submit for your consideration the twenty-third annual report.

The Board met for organization on the first Monday of
February, electing the following officers: Chairman, Dr. Arthur
B. Wetherell; Secretary, Dr. Frank A. Woods; Health Officer,
Mr. Jeremiah J. Linehan.

GENERAL WORK.

The protection of the people from zymotic or infectious
diseases, and the work of keeping the city in clean and sanitary
condition, are subjects of the utmost importance, and the Board
has continued to give these matters careful consideration.
Method, system, and an ever watchful eye have characterized
the actions of the Board in all cases, and the results can be seen
in the decided decrease of nuisances and sources of filth.

There are yet several old and dilapidated buildings, the
removal of which would greatly improve the sanitary condition
of the localities in which they exist. Four such buildings have
been removed during the past year by order of the Board.

The appended report of the Health Officer gives detailed
account of this work.

 
! ,
| REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
| BACTERIOLOGY.
| Dr. H. C. Emerson was again elected bacteriologist of the
| Board. In all cases of diphtheria or throat trouble of suspici| ous nature, the system of bacteriological examinations have
| been continued, and the Board would urge each physician to
exercise due care and promptness in taking swabs for diagnosis
| and release.
The work of this department continues to give the satisfac| tion of previous years, and the success of the system can be
readily seen, as out of the cultures examined, were found
| negative; hence the danger, expense and annoyance of quaran| tining over people has been avoided. .
| Appended ts the report of the Bacteriologist. ,
|
BAKERIES.
| The Board has decided to adopt more stringent methods
to enforce the compliance of the laws regarding bakeries, and
shall use its best efforts during the coming year to still improve
the general conditions.
! Such inspection of bakeries and their surroundings as is
prescribed by law have been made. In majority of cases
: these important places, where so much of our food product is
manufactured, were found to be in good general condition.
‘Twenty-four bakeries are at present in operation in the city.
The Board still endeavors to use its influence against cellar
bakeries, and would advise legislation against the establishment
: of the same.
UNDERTAKERS.
Eleven licenses have been granted during this year. The
undertakers are prompt in“iling the certificates of death, and
are careful in making their returns.

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
SLAUGHTER HOUSES. ,

All slaughter houses and manufacturers of sausage and preared meat within the city have been granted licenses by this
Board. Eight licenses have been granted for the manufacture
of sausage, prepared meat and slaughtering.

. The supervision of these places of business has caused an
improvement in the character of the articles furnished to the
public for consumption.

BARBER SHOPS.

Owing to the adoption and strict enforcement of the Board
of Health rules relative to barber shops, thirty-four unsanitary
basement and kitchen shops have been closed and it is with
pleasure that the Board reports all barber shops at present complying strictly with the rules.

There are fifty-four barber shops in the city.

) FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. .

The Board is pleased to report that there is no cause for
complaint in regard to the sale of decayed fruits and vegetables
and there have been no prosecutions for selling the same during
the past year.

The Board would recommend that no junk dealers be granted
alicense to peddle fruits or vegetables, owing to the fact that
they use the same vehicle for both purposes and frequently store
old junk, rags, fruits, vegetables, etc., in the same building.
INSPECTOR OF MILK, VINEGAR AND PETROLEUM.

The Board can report that the duties of this office are performed in most satisfactory manner, the quality of milk is up
to the standard and there have been very few complaints.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
BARNS AND LIVERY STABLES.
Nineteen applications have been received for the erection
| or use of buildings as barns or livery stables. ‘hese have received ca’eful consideration. The locations have been inspected
| and permits have been granted in most cases.
PLUMBERS.

The Board of Plumbing Examiners have examined all applicants referred to them by this Board.

There have been three applications made to the Board for
employing and four for journeyman plumber's licenses.

Four of the above applicants were granted licenses and
three were refused.

Appended is the report of the Plumbing Examiners.

SANITARY INSPECTION.

The Board can report that the work in this division of its
department has been carried on in thorough and satisfactory
manner.

The report of the Inspector of Plumbing shows that there
has been more new work done in the city during the past year

| than in the preceding twelve months, and the addition of the
unusual large amount of old work condemned and replaced, together with the required tests, has necessitated large number
of inspections.

A house-to-house inspection of plumbing is an urgent necessity and the Board would again recommend that special
appropriation be made and the work commenced early in the
year. The report of the Inspector of Plumbing is appended.

VAULTS AND CESSPOOLS. !

The Board is pleased to state that there are comparatively
few vaults remaining in the city, and wherever sewer privileges
have allowed, the use of the vault has been condemned.

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  

With comparatively little expense to the city, short sewers
withe laterals could be laid, which would allow the Board to
abolish the majority of the remaining vaults.

SEWERS AND DRAINS.

The Walnut street sewer is still nuisance and source of
filth, and its sewage should not be allowed to pass through
the canals. ‘The Board would urge that this nuisance be abated
in the manner already suggested by the City Engineer. )

 The large amount of sewage discharged directly from the
mills into the canals in its course through the city is objectionable from sanitary point of view, and the public health demands
that some other disposal of this sewage should be made.

The Board would again recommend that lateral sewers be
laid on Main street, north and south from Berkshire street and
that some provision be made for the east side of North Summer
street.

The condition of drainage of the houses at Ingleside should
receive consideration, as under the present conditions there is
serious danger of an epidemic in that vicinity.

VITAL STATISTICS.

The Board presents for consideration the following resume
of the vital statistics for the year ending November .

There has been reported during the twelve months,  
deaths and still births, death rate of per cent per
thousand inhabitants, which compared with deaths and  
still births death rate of per cent per thousand reported
last year, shows an increase this year of only deaths or less
than per cent per thousand. ‘This is very satisfactory in a
manufacturing city with the crowded tenement districts here existing.

The appened “Table A” shows the comparative number of
deaths, still births and death-rates for the past ten years, to
  inclusive, the average number of deaths being  and

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.

the average death-rate per cent per thousand. In
considering this table the increase in the population of the city
during this period, should be appreciated.

‘Table B” presents the number of deaths and still-births
occurring each month during the year, showing that the mortality has been larger during the months of April, May and July
and very light during the months of March, October and November. |

“Table C” shows that of the deaths recorded during
the year,  or per cent, were females, and  or  
per cent, were males; and of the still-births, were males and
  were females.

“Table gives the deaths by sex and age, showing that
of the deaths recorded,  or per cent, were under  
year of age,  Or per cent were under years of age,
and  or per cent, had been over so years of age.

During the preceding year,  or per cent, were
under year of age,  or per cent, were under years
of age, and  or per cent, were over years of age,
showing that there has been an increase in the number of deaths
under and years of age anda slight decrease in those over
  years of age.

“Table E” presents the exact cause of each death occurring
during the year. It shows that there were deaths from contagious diseases, as compared with deaths from these causes

- during the preceding year, although there have been nearly
three times as many cases.of contagious diseases. There were
  deaths from Tuberculosis, as compared with during  ,
and deaths from Cancer, as compared with during the preceding year. In the nervous diseases there is decrease of  
deaths from the number reported last year, and an increase in
deaths due to respiratory and violent causes.

“Table F” gives the number of deaths occurring in the various institutions of the city and in each ward. This will be of
interest as showing the portion of the city in which the greatest
and smallest number of deaths have occurred. We find, as has
existed during the preceding years, the greatest number of

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
deaths have occured in wards and  while ward has had the
smallest number. or per cent of the total deaths of
the city occurred in the institutions.

The death rate of the city is increased to considerable ;
extent by the deaths in the institutions of the city, of non-resi-
dents who are brought here for care and treatment.

In “Table G” will be found the nativity of those dying in
the city during  Of the deaths, were born in Holyoke; in Massachusetts (otherwise); anda total of in the
United States were born in Ireland; in Canada; in
Germany; in England; in Scotland; and the remainder in
the other foreign countries.

‘“ Table H” presents the place of interment of all bodies
buried in the city, and the bodies sent away for burial. It
shows that during the year bodies were brought to Holyoke

- and sent away for burial. Nine hundred and thirty-three
burial permits have been issued from the office during the year.

CONTAGIOUS DISEASES.

| With the exception of an epidemic of measles the city has
been very free from disease of contagious nature during the
year. Small pox again made its appearance, but was of mild |
character and was readily controlled.

The fatalities from diseases of this class have been very
small, and comparison of the number of cases and deaths from
the same with that of last year  very interesting.

Four and Five respectively.

MEASLES.

An epidemic of measles began in the month of February,
lasting until the first of June. The disease was very mild in
character, there being few deaths. ‘There were reported during
the year cases with deaths, death rate of per cent
as compared with cases and deaths, death rate of

throughout the city, Wards One, Two and Four suffering the

reported. ‘This disease has also been general throughout the
city, no locality being free from it.

TYPHOID FEVER.

There has been reported during the year, cases of typhoid fever with deaths, death rate of per cent, as

any class or locality and most cases have been traced to points
of contagion outside the city.

| CONTAGIOUS DISEASE HOSPITAL.
The Board would once again call attention to the imperative need of hospital for the care of diseases of contagious
| nature, especially diphtheria aud scarlet fever. The value of
| such institutions is being realized more and more each year and
many of the cities of the state now have such accommodations
which greatly aid in the control of epidemics of such diseases.
With our large tenement districts, it is evident that we should
have such building at our command in the city, |
PEST HOUSE.
The present pest house in use by the city is well suited in
most ways and furnishes very satisfactory as well as secluded
place of confinement for persons suffering with small-pox. Im- |
| provements should however be made in the sanitary arrangements. sanitary system should be arranged to remove the
| sewage from the building and satisfactory receptacle made
for the same. small addition should also be added to include
a disinfecting room for those who are obliged to visit the building, and also bathroom for the use of the patients. These
necessities are indispensable and should receive immediate
attention.

REPORT OF THE HEALTH OFFICER. |
To the Board of Health.

GENTLEMEN:—TI hereby submit report of your Health
Officer for  During the past year the number of minor
nuisances has decreased, but the amount of food products destroyed has increased. This is partly due to fire in South
Holyoke, where the Board, after careful consideration, decided
that said food was unfit for use.

Under rule, and one which think very wise one, all
applicants for license to peddle vegetables, fruit and other !
products is referred to the Board of Health, which in every case |
is carefully investigated as to the storage of these goods. Of
the many cases referred to the Board, only three were refused a
license for lack of residence or location.

REPORT OF THE
INSPECTOR OF PLUMBING:

To the Board of Health.

of submitting the tenth annual report for the fiscal year ending

the work:

|

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.

Each case has complied with the requirements of the Board.
In addition to the inspection of old and new plumbing, great
many examinations and peppermint tests have been made at the
requests of owners, agents and tenants, and in most cases defective plumbing has been repaired on verbal notification from the
inspector without any action by the Board, and of which no
records have been made.

Your Inspectior would call your attention to the growing
demand made on his time by reason of complaints regarding
imperfect plumbing and nuisances pertaining to same. These
complaints frequently take up the entire time of the Inspector
and as the general public now realize that imperfect and unsanitary plumbing is menace to health, the complaints are constantly increasing.

The sanitary condition of Hillside Hospital calls for immediate action. fumigating and bath room should be installed
for the use of convalescent patients and proper disposal made
of the sewage. The continued use of the privy vault in its present location is to be condemned and in the opinion of the
writer there is grave danger of the pollution of the water of the
surrounding country by the present general sanitary conditions,
which are positively dangerous when the house is occupied by
small pox patients.

A house to house inspection is an urgent necessity and the
work should be commenced immediately.

In conclusion desire to thank the members of the Board
for their courtesy and cooperation.

Respectfully submitted,
F. L. AVERY,
Inspector of Plumbing.

REPORT OF THE
BOARD OF PLUMBING EXAMINERS.
Lo the Board of Health,
GENTLEMEN :—The report of the Board of Plumbing Examiners for the fiscal year ending November is hereby
respectfully submitted.
Number of applications for Employing Plumbers’
examinations, :  
Number of applications for Journeyman Plumbers’
examinations, ,  
Number of. applicants recommended to the Board of
Health as not qualified to receive an Employing
Plumbers’ license,  
Number of applicants recommended to the Board of
Health as qualified to receive Journeyman
Plumbers’ license,  
The number of applications for examinations have diminished during the year as the plumbers realize the fact that they
must be thoroughly competent before taking examination. ‘The
result is that the city saves considerable money for examining
incompetent men and the general class of mechanics are improved.

REPORT OF THE BACTERIOLOGIST.
To the Board of Health, City of Holyoke.

GENTLEMEN:—I have the honor to present the following
report for the year ending November .

. One hundred and sixty-three cases have been referred to
me for examination, which is less than Jast year. Of these,
  proved to be positive, that is showing the presence of diphtheria germs, and were negative. The feature of interest in
this year’s work has been the fact that all but cases were referred to me at the beginning of the illness of the patient, thus
determining positively whether the inflammation of the throat or
nose was due to diphtheria bacilliorsome other germ. Of these
  cases that were sent for release only, but one proved positive,
and there must bean element of doubt as to the kind of infection
occurring inthe remaining  It is probably impossible for a
diagnostic culture to be sent in every case, but it seems to me
that your Board is to be congratulated on the small number of
cases in which this precautionary measure is not observed.

For the first time in the four years that have done the
bacteriological work for the Board, the number of cases for
diagnosis that proved negative were greater than those in which
diphtheria germs were found, and it is interesting to note that
in more than twenty of these negative cases the clinical diagnosis of diphtheria was made in addition to the fact that all
must have been considered as possible diphtherias.

The following is the monthly record of cases examined.

The number of women arrested during the year is smaller
than usual. Drunkenness claims larger number, but do not
think it is on the increase among our women; many brought in
for that offense are strangers. In response to my appeal for
clothing, shoes, etc., have had many generous donations for
which am very grateful; the ladies of the ‘““Needle-work Guild”’
sent me large number of garments, and also thank them; the
garments are all new and give much pleasure as well as comfort
to the recipients. We have not had as many lodgers as formerly;

  REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF POLICE.
they are usually women who come here seeking employment
often without money or friends.

In conclusion wish to thank the Marshal, and his assistants and the members of the force, for the courteous treatment
and ready assistance extended to me at all times.

POLICE SIGNAL SYSTEM.

The Signal System has been in operation four years, and
while the department is benefited to great extent byits use, I
think some systems are as far superior to this as this one is
over none, and believe little invéstigation on the part oj
your honorable board will readily convince the members of the
absolute importance of an up to date system for this department.

The following is the extent of the Police Signal System used
during the year: .

Duty calls from patrolmen,  
Telephone calls, .  
Wagon calls, .  
Miles run, .  

| DISCIPLINE.

The discipline of the force has been well maintained during
the year. As general thing there seems to have been commendable disposition on the part of the rank and file to govern
themselves properly, thereby assisting the heads of the department in their endeavor to bring the discipline to high standard. .

RECOMMENDATIONS.

The Bertillon System of measurements for the identification of criminals ought to be adopted by this department. Itisa
system of measurements that makes the identification of man
positive. It is being generally used in other cities and is without any question one of the most indispensable requirements in
police work. The expense for the outfit comprising the measuring apparatus is comparatively small.

  REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF POLICE.
CONCLUSION.
I again desire to express My appreciation of the ever
courteous treatment accorded me by his Honor the Mayor, and
the Judge and Clerk of the Police Court, as well as the rank and
file of this department for the ready assistance rendered me at
| all times in the performance of my duty. |
