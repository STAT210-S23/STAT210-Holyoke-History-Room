Mayor’s Address.
oo ag
Gentlemen of the City Council:

Our fellow citizens have honored us with the administration of the government of this City of Holyoke for
the present year. We have deliberately and solemnly
accepted this high trust; therefore, ‘‘let us reason
together’’ how we may best meet the duties and responsibilities of the trust confided to us; trust that embraces the civil, moral and social welfare of all the
people of this community; trust and privilege
which should appeal to the deepest convictions and the
highest ambitions of every man of us. Let us then at
the outset mutually pledge ourselves to give to the city
the best we have to give of faithful, conscientious service; witha prayerful hope that Almighty God will
give us wisdom and courage to do the right thing, and
vouchsafe his blessing upon our labors. The  phenomenal growth of Holyoke from sparsely settled
village to populous city, from little town to great
manufacturing center, all within the memory of the
present generation (covering as it doesa little more than
a quarter of century) has brought with it somewhat
phenomenal condition of affairs,and truly phenomenal
city debl, which has grown with our growth and
strengthened with our strength. Under the provisions
of the general laws of the Commonwealth it becomes

  "Mayors Address. )

necessary to provide for the payment ofa portion of

this municipal indebtedness from year to year, which |

burden, together with the annual interest accounts and ,

the natural increasing expenditures for runuing expenses

and public improvements for the growing city, make

the management of the city finances serious problem. |

To keep the burden of taxation within proper limits,

and at the same time to provide for the reasonable de- :

mand for public improvements, not forgetting that the

future welfare of the citv depends largely upon your

present action, is task that will tax your wisdom to

its utmost, and demand your most painstaking and |

thoughtful consideration. Fortunately for the city, the |

tax payers (by their record in the past) believe in progress and the means necessary to promote the growth

and prosperity of this community, but, they also be- |

lieve in paying their debts, and will demand of you,

and rightly too, the same care and prudence in the

municipal expenditures that are applied to the management of successful corporation; in short, not nar- |

row, parsimonious spirit, but wisely economical, busi- |

ness-like administration. There is healthy and grow- |

ing disposition throughout the land, to scrutinize closely

the public service, wherever it is wasteful or corrupt, :

and to demand the prompt reform of all abuses, without |

regard to when or where they originated or by virtue of !

what time-honored precedent they exist. |
Realizing these facts, as trnst we all do, shall con- |

fidently invest the chiefs of the several departments |

with the full responsibilities of their -offices and hold

them tuo strict accountability for the faithful and

Mayor's Address.  
efficient discharge of the duties incumbent upon them
and their subordinates. For my own part pledge you,

| gentlemen, hearty and conscientious co-operation in |
carrying into effect, so far as my duty and jurisdiction
as chief magistrate will permit, whatever you in your
wisdom may lawfully direct for the well-being of our
city, during the brief time for which we have been appointed to work together.

From the reports of the various departments of the
government am able to submit to you brief statement
} of their present condition. For lack of time however,
to give all of them that careful study necessary to form
an intelligent opinion of their practical workings and
their prospective needs, am unable at the present
moment to formulate, or to tax your yatience with an
overdose of premature advice upon matters which will
come before you for your deliberation and action. Such
additional suggestions as may have to offer will be

duly made as the opportunity presents itself.

- Without attempting the thankless and useless task |
of criticizing or passing judgment upon the condition of

to the tax payers of the city to remind you that in the :
opinion of many of the best men amongst us, the time
has now come when Holyoke should begin to look the \
facts of the case squarely in the face, and take areckoning for its future course. The unprecedented growth of !
the city may have justified the lavish outlay of the past, :
but with debt of nearly three-quarters of million dol- |
lars, it behooves you to remember that needless extrava- |
| gance leads to bankruptcy. Fortunately the city of Hol  
yoke, with its vast resources, enjoys good credit, but
therein liesadanger. It isa good rule for cities as well as
individuals, to pay as you go, and to live within your income. ‘The proper income of city is only that derived
from taxation, and it is not wise policy to burden the
taxable property of the city beyond limit which will  
put the city out of competition with other localities inviting investment for capital, for business enterprises.
It is alike the duty and the opportunity of the adminis- |

tration to inaugurate an era of reform in the management of the public funds.

DEPARTMENT EXPENSES.

, From the auditor's report it appears that the appropriations and receipts for the past financial year were
$ that the expenditures were  leaving an
excess of  not provided for in the appropriations
for the various departments, the accounts of twelve of
which would appear to have been overdrawn. The
largest single item of this excess is  which
stands charged to the sewer-and-drain account, large
part of which is uncollected. The other overdrafts are,
in round numbers,  on account of sidewalks,
nearly  each on School, Pauper and interest accounts,  for the Fire department,  for the
Police department,  for paving and  for
salaries. |

In this connection wish to call your attention to the
provisions of the City Charter, covering this matter of
expenditures and appropriations, for your guidance
during the coming year. Further details of the city’s
finances will be found in the reports of City Treasurer
and Auditor,which will be presented for your consideration and will need your earnest attention.

PUBLIC WORKS.

From report of the Superintendent of Streets it
appears that  have been expended upon
sewers and drains. Of this sum  was expended to complete the Front street sewer, leaving the expenses for other extensions about  for the year.
For paving the streets, for sidewalks, for highways and bridges, For the par.
ticulars which go to make up the grand total can only
refer you to the thoughtful and comprehensive report of
the Superintendent. It is generally acknowledged that
the highways of the city are in an excellent condition.
I trust it may be possible in your wisdom to reduce the
burden of taxation somewhat by making haste slowly,

a, ;
| Mayors Address.  and by carefully considering each step in ordering the
construction of new works. The public needs, not private interests, however urgently pressed, should be your
/ guide and your limitation.
SEW ERS.

The City Engineer reports the construction of  
feet of new sewers during the past year atacost of
$ and pertinently remarks that it has been tho
busiest year in his department that the city has ever
known. The need and importance of thorough and
comprehensive system of drainage is recognized by all
thoughtful and public-spirited citizens, but the enormous expense attending the annual extension of the sys| tem demands your careful scrutiny. The apportion| ment and collection of the sewer assessments, one-third
of which only is chargeable to the city, should be conducted upon strict business principles, and to this end
I respectfully direct your attention to the large amount
of uncollected sewer assessments now due the city.

The Engineer’s report is too voluminous for more
than cursory review at this time, but it will be found
to contain many valuable suggestions in regard to the
wise expenditure of the funds annually devoted to this
department.

: PUBLIC PARKS. }
| The care and control of the public parks is now wisely
intrusted to board of Park Commissioners, who report
their expenditure, for the past year to have been 

  Mayors Address.
|
 which sum has been prudently and wisely ex- |
pended for the improvement of the several parks of the m
city, in the establishment of drinking fountains, the
grading and otherwise beautifying these places of public
resort and refreshment. Few cities have had the forethought to provide in timely manner for these breathing places for the people wno have no other resources |
for pleasure and relaxation in their hours of leisure.
The Commissioners in their report recommend the securing of further provisions of this kind, and join with
them in recommending that you take early action looking to the purchase of some suitable and inexpensive :
tract of land for large public park.
PUBLIC LIBRARY.
The city appropriated for the public library  e
last year. No worthier use can be made of such a
sum from the public funds. As one of the civilizing
and educational institutions of the city, the public library cannot be too highly appreciated and lam glad to
believe that it is increasing its usefulness from year to
year. While cordially recommend that you continue |
a generous appropriation for the maintenance and further growth of the library, beg to suggest that it !
would seem to be both wise and proper that the city |
should have some representative upon its board of direction as is the case inother cities, when at least one
member is annually chosen to represent the city in the
management of the library, by the same authority that )
confers the appropriation. commend chis matter to |
your attention.
’

|
Mayor's Address.  
PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

| The number of pupils in the public schools at the
close of the past school year was out of total of
  children of school age as shown by the city census.
In addition to the membership of the public schools
there were enrolled in the parochial and private schools
 making total of in all the public and private
schools of the city. The total expenses for this department for the year was as shown by the
Superintendent’s report. The number of pupils in the
High School is reported as  with accommodations
for but sittings in the study halls. The crowded
condition of this building makes it apparent that some
action should be taken to provide for the increasing
demands for suitable accommodations for this important
department of the public education which cannot wisely
be long delayed. Itis probable that you will be asked
to provide additional facilities for the increasing membership of the other grades, the status and needs of
which are intelligently treated of in the Superintendent’s report.

The report of the Superintendent presents in detail
many timely and wise suggestions for your consideration, and explains the excess of expenditures over the
estimates during the past year as due to the adoption
of free text books, the cost of which could not be determined at the outset.

EVENING SCHOOLS.
' The cost of maintaining the evening schools has been

  Mayors Address. |
$  for the past year. The money spent for eve- |
ning schools provides an opportunity to learn to read |
and write, for large class of both young and adult per- é
sons, of both sexes, which, from the circumstances of
their lives, could be obtained in no other way. These
schools should be sustained and encouraged in every |
possible way.

LIQUOR LICENSES.

There can be no mistaking of the recent expression of
the intelligent public sentiment of thiscity upon the |
question of unrestricted license. The citizens have voted
to license the sale of intoxicating liquors believing this |
to be the best way to regulate and curtail this traffic, |
but they have left it, under the law, entirely within
your province to delermine how many and to whom licenses should be granted for the coming year. The responsibility rests upon the Board of Aldermen, and no
where else, and the people will hold them to strict ac- !
count for the manner in which they exercise this power |
for good or evil in this community. My own observa- .
tion, as physician of the steady increase of pauperism,
insanity and crime, directly traceable to the cause of intemperance, leaves me nochoice but to cast the weight of
my personal and official influence, much or little as it
may be, squarely on the side of reform on this question.
The number, character and location of the places to be
licensed under the law is matter of serious importance
to the welfare of this community. commend this subject to your earnest consideration and trust you will ex-’

Mayor's Address.  
ercise wise and discriminating judgment in dealing
, with it and pledge you faithful execution of the laws
regulating the sale of liquor during my term of office.
CITY SOLICITOR.

The City Solicitor reports that there are only three
cases now pending against the city in the Superior
Court. Seven suits have been brought against the city
during the past year, six of which have been satisfactorily disposed of during the year. His report presents a
detailed statement of the nature of these various claims,
and offers some pertinent suggestions in relation to this
subject.

PAUPER DEPARTMENT.

The Overseers of the Poor report the expenditure of
$  in this department during the year, an increase of  over the appropriation. They report the number of paupers to be rapidly increasing
from year to year, as the city grows, and recommend
the purchase of land and the erection of suitable almshouse for the care of the city’s dependents join in
this recommendation, believing it to be measure of
economy for the city and as humane provision for the
care of the poor and helpless, as well as means of reducing the present cost of maintaining elsewhere ata
large expense the harmless insane patients of the city.

POLICE DEPARTMENT.

The pay-roll of the Police Department was ,

and the miscellaneous expenses The appro- ,

  Mayors Address.
priation for this fund was  the receipts from
officers’ fees showing an over-draft of  as shown by the report of the Chief of Police. 
The application of the civil-service rules under the !
Commissioners appointed by the State has greatly sim- |
plified the duty and responsibility of the Mayor in the |
selection of the members of the force. This will ulti- |
mately tend to create permanent and efficient department and prove safeguard against the prostitution of
this branch of the public service to political ends.
Officers charged with the execution of the laws should !
be secure in their positions during good behavior, and
only removed for cause. shall endeavor to be guided
by this principle and make faithfulness and efficiency |
the only test. |
FIRE DEPARTMENT.
The expenses of this department for the year now
closed are reported by the Chief Engineer as ,
from which should be deducted the prods of the sale |
of the old High street engine-house. The new High !
street engine-house cost The sum of has been expended for the repair of the Relief engine- |
honse;  for water;  for salaries; !
  for the pay of members. Swinging harnesses and other |
improvements have been adopted reducing the average ,
time to seconds from the stroke of the gong. The ap'  paratus is reported to be in good condition, and the de- |
partment is asa whole well managed. It is not probable that any considerable addition to the present equipment will be needed the coming year, as the department
|

Mayors Address.  
would seem to be in thoroughly efficient and satisfactory condition. The services of the officers and members
cannot be too highly appreciated by the citizens whose
property they guard, and bespeak for them more considerate attention and support in all that the good of
the service may properly demand.

ELECTRIC LIGHTS.

So far as have been able to learn, the adoption of a
limited number of electric lights has met the approval
of the tax payers and citizens generally. That they are
a modern improvement and in measure public safeguard and convenience can be safely admitted, but the
question of their relative cost and their future multiplication throughout the city is matter which vour committee for this department will do well to carefully investigate in all its bearings.

| THE BOARD OF HEALTH.

The appropriation by the city for the maintenance of
this department for the present year was An
additional appropriation of  was subsequently
made for the purchase of land and the erection of hospital for the isolation and care of infectious diseases.
Owing to my personal relations to this department as
a member of the Board and as City Physician, prefer
at this time to refer you to their reports for information.
I can, however, honestly say that the city is greatly indebted for its immunity from epidemics and to its exceptionally good sanitary condition, to the earnest and in}

{
  Mayors Address.
telligent labor of the Board of Health. No department |
of the public service deserves more thoughtful and generous consideration at your hands than this Board, to 
whose care is entrusted the duty of guarding the public !
health. Task your attention to their recommendation
for providing city hospital, and shall take occasion ,
at proper time to urge upon you the pressing need for
action in this matter.
FINALE.
In conclusion, gentlemen, assure you that the city
needs and will expect of yon vour best effort, your impartial judgment, and your conscientious action in every
department of its affairs. Believing that you will join
with me in the endeavor to preserve and to strengthen :
the good name, the good order, and good morals of our »
city, have accepted my portion of the task before us.
Let us then foreshadow the policy of this administration
| by resolving that we will each and all try to do our |
whole duty, honestly and fearlessly, patiently abiding |
the result, and hopefully awaiting the verdict of our |
masters, the people, whose servants we are and whose
interests we are in honor bound to protect. Gentlemen,
I thank you for your courteous and patient attention,
and trust we shall find mutual pleasure in our mutual
relations in the duties before us. |

Report of City Solicitor.
gp
To the Honorable Mayor and City Councit of the City
of Holyoke :

I beg leave to submit the following report of the
business of my department for the municipal year ending Nov. .

There were two cases pending against the city, Jan.  ,
 Seven cases have been brought against the city
during the year; five in the Superior Court, and two in
the Police Court of Holyoke.

Six of the above cases were disposed of during the
year, and there are three cases now pending in the
Superior Court. ,

On the  th of November the City was notified by
Stephen K. Searle of claim for damages by him, on
account of injuries sustained and damage to property
caused by his wagon wheel striking stump in the roadway in the western part of the city in the vicinity of the
house of Michael O’Connell. No suit has, as yet, been
commenced.

Emma Leonard, vs. the City of Holyoke, writ dated
May Damages claimed being an action
for injuries caused by falling on the sidewalk opposite
the coal office of W. B. Whiting Co. on Dwight street,
on account of alleged accumulations of ice and snow.
At the trial of the case at the March term of the court,
 the city objected that the notice served upon it was
not sufficient,and the objection was sustained. The plainReport of City Solicitor.  
tiff took the case to the Supreme Court, on exceptions,
and the exceptions were sustained and new trial
ordered. The case was on for trial at the last June term
of the court. learned that the plaintiff claimed that
her injuries were very serious and perhaps permanent,
and requested City Physician O’Connor to make an
examination, which he did in company with Dr. Breck
of Springfield. They reported the case as one in which
the plaintiff could probably satisfy the jury that she
had been seriously and perhaps more or less perma.
nently injured. On consultation with Mr. Stearns and
the physicians, and in consideration of the serious
nature of the injury, it was thought advisable to accept
an offer made by the plaintiff to take and said
sum was paid in settlement of the case.

Olivia Burgess, vs. the City of Holyoke, writ dated
September Damages claimed being an
action for injuries caused by falling on the sidewalk on
the corner of Appleton and Race streets on account of
the accumulation of ice and snow thereon. The form of
the notice served upon the City in this case was the
same as that in the Leonard case, and it was continued
to await the decision of the Supreme Court in the Leonard case. The court having decided in the Leonard case
that the notice was sufficient, this case was put on the
list for trial at the last June term of the court. The
injury was seriously sprained ankle, from which it
appeared that the plaintiff had suffered much pain and
was fora long time prevented from doing any labor. In
fact the plaintiff claimed she was permanently injured
by the fall. The case was settled by the payment of

The long pending matter of the Sargeant street crossing was concluded during the summer. The law provides that highway shall not cross railroad at level
therewith unless the public necessity and convenience so
require. It was admitted by all the witnesses who testified for the City, both at the hearing before the County
Commissioners and at that before the Railroad Commissioners, that the way should be laid out under the
tracks if it would be practicable to do so. It appeared
to be the general opinion, including the opinion of some
large tax-payers, who testified at the hearings, that a
way under the tracks was preferable to grade crossing,
even though the city had to bear all the expense. But
the city maintained that since the public convenience
and necessity required that way be laid out at that
point, and since way could not be laid out under the
tracks at the grade then existing, because of the danger
to the trunk sewer and because the way would be below
the water-line of the canal, and since it was not practicable to lay out way over the tracks, that way ought
to be laid out at grade and that once it was laid out at
grade either party could petition the County Commissioners to have the grades separated. The railroad
company admitted that way could not be laid out under
the tracks at the then grade, but they said that grade

  Report of City Solicitor.
crossing should not be allowed under any circumstances,
and that the city should either raise the tracks at its
own expense or that the company would raise the tracks
at the expense of the city. This was the issue. The
company maintained that grade crossing should not be
ullowed and that the city should bear the expense of
raising the tracks so that way could be laid out under
them. The city maintained that since it was proven and
admitted by the company that the public convenience
and necessity required way to be laid ont, and it was
impracticable to lay out way either under or over the
tracks, that way should be laid out at grade and that |
if the company wanted to oblige the city to lay outa
way under the tracks, it must raise its tracks and of
course at its own expense. hearing was had  before
the County Commissioners upon the question and they
allowed grade crossing. Before, however, such a
- crossing can be laid out the law requires that the Railroad Commissioners must consent thereto, and consequently they were petitioned to consent to the crossing
as allowed by the County Commissioners. The Railroad
Commissioners set time for the hearing upon the question as to whether they would consent. Between the
times, however, when the County Commissioners allowed
the grade crossing and the time set for hearing, the
company raised its tracks several feet at its own expense
and then claimed at the hearing before the Railroad
Commissioners that the tracks were then high enough to
allow way to be laid out under them, and asked the
Commissioners to refuse their consent toa grade crossing.
The Commissioners decided that the hearing before them
was an original one, and that the question before them
was: What was then the condition of the crossing? —
And since it appeared that the tracks were raised high
enough to permit suitable way to be laid out under
them they refused to consent to the grade crossing. And

Report of City Solicitor.  
consequently, upon another petition, the city, by authority of the County Commissioners, proded to lay out
a way under the. tracks.

The condition of the road under the railroad bridge on
Mosner street has been source of much annoyance during large portion of the year. The way to reach the
difficulty is not clear. If the railroad company is to
blame, the remedy would probably be by application to
a Court of Equity to oblige the company to comply with
an order made bv the County Commissioners with reference to the drainage under the bridge In decree
made by the County Commissioners June upon
a petition of the Connecticut River Railroad Company,
asking for an alteration of the grades of Mosher street
and said railroad, the said Commissioners provided that
‘tall the present sewers and water pipes and the drainage
under the bridge to be provided for.’’ The question is:
Have the railroad company complied with this order, |
and if they have not, what can be done about it? The
situation is somewhat complicated by the neglect of the
company to do what the law required it to do in the
matter of the alteration of the grades, and perhaps by
the failure of the city to see to it that the company did
what it was required todo. Section of Chapter  
of the Public Statutes, provides that, ‘‘a railroad corporation may raise or lower highway or other way for
the purpose of having its road pass over or under the
same, but before proding to cross or to alter or excavate for the purpose of crossing the way, it shall obtain
from the County Commissioners decree prescribing
what alterations shall be made in the way, and the manner and time of making the alterations or structures
which the Commissioners may require at the crossing,
and before entering upon, excavating or altering the
way, Shall give to the city or town in which the crossing
is situated, security, satisfactory to the Commissioners,

  Report af City Solicitor.
that it will faithfully comply with the requirements of
the decree to their acceptance, and will indemnify the
city or town against all damages and charges by reason
of failure so to do.’ When made an investigation
of the matter during the summer, in response, think,
to vote of the City Council, discovered that the railroad company never gave the security required by the
above section. The effect of not giving it was onsidered
but it was not clear what the effect was. It is probable,
however, that the failure of the company to give security would not deprive the city of any rights which it
might have in relation to the roadway under the bridge.
I saw Mr. Leonard, the president of the company, several times in reference to the matter. He claimed that
the company have complied with the above order of the
County Commissioners with reference to the drainage
under the bridge. He says that the catch-basins under
the bridge are sufficiently large, and making them larger
would endanger the security of the bridge; that the difficulty cannot be remedied until the city paves the street;
that the hill east of the bridge is so steep, and the sand
so loose, that any sharp, heavy rain-storm would clog
any catch-basin that could be put in; and that if the
city would pave the street each side of the bridge there
would be no more trouble with the drainage. Mr.
Leonard expressed himself as desirous to do what was
right in the matter, and said he would see the mayor
and try to arrive at some understanding. am not
aware, however, that any understanding has  been
arrived at. catch-basin was put in during the summer by the City,which to some extent, at least, remedies
the difficulty under the bridge.

. have collected during the year, and,paid over to the
city treasurer, the sum of being claims for sewer
assessments which had been handed me by the treasurer
as being difficult of collection.

Report of City Solicitor.  

My report might well be considered incomplete if I
failed to make mention of the case brought by the City
against John G. Mackintosh, and spoken of as the case
against the Arlington Club. ‘This suit, on account of
the character of the parties involved, and the circumstances under which it arose, is approaching the proportions of ‘‘Celebrated Case,’’ locally considered. It is
understood that Mr. Mackintosh claims, on behalf of
himself and the other gentlemen of the Club, that they
have just ground of grievance against the City, or
rather perhaps against the officers of the City responsible
for the bringing of the suit; that they have not been
fuirly dealt with by the City, and that through unworthy
motives, the City, through certain of its officers; is
endeavoring to extort money from them. Since the
favors of the City, through its City government, should
be bestowed alike upon all its citizens, propose
to state the facts in the case in order that it may be
judged as to whether Mr. Mackintosh and the gentlemen
who form the Arlington Club have been excepted from
the rule. In doing this propose to say nothing of any
attempts to collect the claim made before it was handed
me, since they are matters not within my own knowledge.
The reception of the Arlington Club, in honor of the Governor, was given, believe, about mid-winter; nothing
appears to show that the club asked for any reduction of
rates for the use of the City Hallin connection with the
reception, or if asked was allowed. In fact it is understood that Mr. Mackintosh refused to ask the City Council to make reduction in the rates when the matter was
suggested to him. Be that as it may, there was no vote
of the City Council permitting the hall to be used on the
occasion at reduced rates. The matterof payment to the
City was permitted torun into mid-summer, without being
adjusted, and the claim was handed to me for collection.
Supposing that would have no difficulty in settling the

  Report of City Solicitor.
claim with Mr. Mackintosh, wrote him, informing him
of the claim and requesting him to attend to the settlement thereof. waited two or three weeks fora reply
from him, which never received, and on the  th of
August, madea writ against him, returnable to the
Police Court of Holyoke, the  th of September, following. Although two months had intervened between the
time wrote Mr. Mackintosh and the entering of the
writ in court, he has never communicated with me either
directly or indirectly with reference to the case. He
states, understand, that he is willing to pay all that he
ought to pay and yet when given an opportunity to present to the Court the question as to how much he owes,
he declined to avail himself of it, but pleaded in abatement to the writ, and asked that all the other members
of the Club be brought in as defendants. made Mr.
Mackintosh the only defendant. It was for him to say
whether he would try the case alone or whether he would
call in the other members of the Club as co-defendants.
He could try the merits of the case alone as well as
by joining one hundred people with him as co-defendants. The only object adefendant generally has in calling in other parties is that they might all bear the bur.
den of judgment if one was recovered against them.
But it can’t be supposed that that is the object of
Mr. Mackintosh, because it must be that he considers the other gentlemen of the Club of such honor
as toaid him in bearing the burden of judgment.
Indeed, it is said that Mr. Mackintosh admits that there
is sufficient money in the treasury to meet any judgment
that may be recovered in the case; so that Mr. Mackintosh’s object in calling on the other members of the Club
as co-defendants is either to embarrass the city in its
efforts to get them into Court on account of supposed
want of jurisdiction in the Court to reach all members of
the Club, or that the officers of the city connected with

Report of City Solicitor.  
the case would not wish to annoy so many respectable
business men by bringing them into Court as co-defendants, and would prefer to discontinue the suit rather
than do so. It is to be regretted that Mr. Mackintosh
sees fit to annoy these gentlemen by having them called
into Court upon claim which can be as well tried without them as with them, and without detriment to the
rights of anybody. Upon motion of Mr. Mackintosh,
however, that the other members of the Club be called
in as co-defendants, they will be called in during the
present month. Mr. Mackintosh who, it is understood
claims he has been ready to pay what he and the Club
owe, not only refused to try the question as to how much
was due from him and the club before the Judge of the
Police Court, when the issue was tendered to him, but
now proposes to beat the city by technicality and pay
nothing, providing the city will let him. ‘‘With malice
toward none and charity toward all,’’ it is obviously the
duty of all officers charged with the collection of claims
due the city to at least try to collect them from all
classes of supposed debtors, and to try to collect them
by suit if necessary. Respectfully submitted,

T. B. DONNELL,
City Solicitor.

These expenditures have been chiefly for improvements on the several parks of the city, as follows: —
PROSPECT PARK.
On this Park, the borders of plots Jaid out, graded
and seeded last year have been turfed to preserve their
outline, and variety of trees have been planted.
On that portion of the Park lying west of the Elm
street entrance, which was partially graded last year, the
walks have been laid out and the plots graded, loamed
and seeded; and something has been done for the protection of the bank along the line of the railroad.
An ornamental pump-house has been built over the
spring of water which formerly flowed from the bank |

connected with the spring, by which the water is lifted
to the house, and is now obtained without descending
the bank as formerly. Last year steps leading to the
spring were provided, but objections to this arrangement
were raised by the railroad company on the ground that
it invited people into danger from passing trains, and
the Commissioners thought the objections were well
founded, and consider the present arrangement an
important improvement. |

HAMPDEN PARK.

On this Park additional trees have been planted to
complete the original design. oe

The Commissioners, believing that supply of good

: drinking water at this point would be great public
blessing, decided to try the experiment of supplying
water cooled sufficiently to be palatable, but not so cold
as to be unwholesome. For-this purpose cylindrical
iron tank was provided, in the center of which smaller
cylinder was placed to hold the ice for cooling the water
contained in the annular space between the outside of
the smaller cylinder and the inside of the larger one; a
capacity of about forty gallons, and the whole sheltered
by an ornamental structure built for the purpose. This
experiment has been very successful, and we think has .
paid well for the outlay.

SOUTH HOLYOKE PARK.

This small Park has been brought to grade, as given
by the City Engineer; laid out into plots, and the walks
on the Park, and the side-walks bordering on it, have
been laid in concrete.

Since our last report the Holyoke Water Power Company has deeded to the City the remaining portion of

  Report of Park Commissioners.

Prospect Park, not contained in the deed given last
year. This portion, which extends from the center line
of the alley between Chestnut and Maple streets to a
point near Union street, is now in very rough state,
und should be graded and the walks laid out and worked
next year, as it detracts from the beauty of the finished
portion.

It is quite necessary also that the grade of Prospect
streetalong the entire length of the Park, should be
brought to grade, and suitable sidewalk provided.

We would again call attention to the importance of
securing some suitable and favorably located tract of
land for large Park, where pleasant drives may be one
of the attractions, before it is tuo late.

There has been an increase in receipts for water rents
over the previous year of The past season
has been remarkable for the abundance of water in the
ponds, and at this writing there is thirteen feet of water in the gate house. |

Report of Water Board.  

This gratifying condition of things was due in no small
degree to the fact that Whiting Street brook has, with
the exception of few weeks in mid-summer furnished
water largely in excess of the amount required in the
higher portions of the city, and which, coming from an
elevation about thirty feet above the ponds has materially diminished the draught of water from that source,
and, during the hours when the brook supplied more
than was consumed its water found an outlet into the
ponds where they were stored for future use when
required. The beneficial results from taking the water
of this brook are not alone the quantity of water
obtained, but the superior quality of it is remarked by
all, and the greater head derived from this source increases
the efficiency of the fire service in the higher parts of
the town, so much so that hydrant stream can be successfully used in case of fire now, while before it was
practically useless. The channel of the brook has been |
deepened, the brush cut from the banks and cleaned
away fora distance of two and half miles from the
dam, and barbed wire fence has been built enclosing
about two acres of land around the gate house. The
claims for land damages on account of the taking of the
waters of this brook have not been adjusted, except in

| the case reported last year.

The road leading to the gate house at Wrights pond
and the low places in the road near the south end of
Ashley pond have been raised above high water mark,
and the small swamp in Allyn’s pasture has been cleared
out and ditched from the spring to the pond. ,

The storage reservoir on Bray Brook is now about
two-thirds full, and the filteration of the water through
the gravel embankment, which at first caused some
iwpprehension, grows less and less each year.

The quality of the general water supply has been
better than usual, and this was undoubtedly caused by a

larger percentage of the supply coming from other
sources than the ponds, than has been the case here tofore.

During the year feet of cast-iron pipe has been
laid, as follows: feet  -inch; feet  -inch ;
  feet  -inch feet  -inch and feet  -inch.
There was also laid feet  -inch wrought iron pipe for
temporary mains. For location, size and length of these
extensions see table ‘‘A’’ of this report.
The length of cast-iron mains is miles, feet, and
a wrought iron temporary main miles, feet, making the total length of supply mains miles, feet.
In laying the mains from Whiting Street brook through
Hampden street, feet of  -inch pipe from Nonotuck
street to Pleasant street, and feet of  -inch pipe
from Pleasant street to School street was taken up and
replaced with  -inch pipe. In laying this pipe at
‘‘Money-Hole’”’ hill the change in line of street was followed and required feet more of pipe than was laid
in the old line of street. The lowering of Sargeant street
under the tracks of the Holyoke Westfield railroad
made it necessary to lower the  -inch main in that street

for distance of nearly feet, and the  -inch main in
Commercial street for distance of about feet. No
trouble has been experienced from leaks in mains, but  

‘leaky connections in service pipes have required attention, and all of them were found in ‘‘wipe’’ joints, on
lead connections our experience leads us to favor a
‘‘tinker’s’’ joint instead of ‘“‘wipe’’ joint for lead connections

During February and March we were troubled with
an epidemic of frozen water pipes, both mains and service pipes being frozen, and for several weeks we had all

| we could do thawing them out. About March we had
so many cases on hand we determined to again try the
‘frost drill,’? which was so successfully used here in
 and we are happy to say after the successful use of’
it last winter and spring, that we consider it far superior
to any other thing or method known to us for thawing
frozen pipes, hydrants, etc. No description of this
machine and method of operation has ever been published in our reports, and as it may be of interest to
other Water Boards, we copy description of the
machine, etc., from the Boston Journal of March  ,
 :

‘HOW TO THAW FROZEN WATER PIPES.”’

 “Ags large amounts are expended every winter by
those in charge of public water works, in digging up
and thawing out frozen mains, hydrants and service
pipes, description of cheap and novel apparatus
recently constructed by the Water Board at Holyoke.
Mass., for thawing out frozen pipes without any digging
whatever, and for greatly cheapening winter digging
whenever repairs are needed on the line of pipe, may be
of interest to those Water Boards whose patience and
purses have been sorely tried during the past rigorous
winter. The contrivance now in use at Holyoke enr  Report of Water Board.

sists, first, of small vertical steam boiler, so mounted
as to be easily drawn about by one horse, and provided
with small water-tank and hand feed-pump, and all
necessary fittings and gauges, the whole being cheap, —
strong affair, such as any mechanic can design, costing
inside of and worth its cost in any town or city
for steaming hydrants alone, in lieu of using steam
fire engine for that purpose. length of one-inch
steam hose and hose for feeding the boiler from
hydrants are attached.

The novelty consists in the ‘‘frost drill’ as it has
been named, which surprises men familiar with -earthwork by the ease and rapidity with which it penetrates
four or five feet of frozen soil and brings the live steam
directly in contact with the frozen pipe. Some of the
men employed on the Holyoke Water Works, in digging
to main near mill, sought to expedite their work by
covering the hole with sacking and conveying steam into
it from the mill; and in so doing found out that pipe
delivering jet of live steam from its open end could be
readily made to enter frozen ground, and with little
pressure would work its way through several feet of
frost in very short time.

To utilize this property of steam, straight piece of
three-quarters-inch iron pipe, five and one-half feet long,
is drawn down at one end to nozzle of one-half inch
Opening, and gas-fitter’s cross’’ is screwed on to the
other end. Hemp-wound wrought-iron handles are
screwed into the side openings of the cross, and an elbow
and coupling fill the remaining opening. The drill is
then ready to couple to the steam hose and to do good
deal of work for its size and cost. |

When frozen main or service pipe is reported, the
boiler is fired up and taken to the spot, with its fireman
and one or two laborers. The foreman decides, if ‘he
can, where the freeze is, and if in doubt begins at a

Report of Water Board.  
point which he is sure is beyond it, and operations commence, The drill is placed over the line of the pipe, the
nozzle pointing obliquely downward to the pipe to be
thawed out, and steam is admitted. (Thirty pounds
pressure will do the work, and sixty or eighty will be
still better. At Holyoke the pressure is generally kept
at forty-five or fifty when at work.) The operator
presses on the handles of the drill, and in from one to
five minutes generally has the nozzle down to the pipe
The frozen earth in its course becomes semi-fiuid mass
—mud, in fact—and the drill can usually be worked
past any stones found in pipe trenches, and if not new
thrust of the drill is made. When the drill is down, it
is allowed to remain few minutes, and of course the
live steam penetrates to considerable distance from the
nozzle, thawing the frozen pipe and the earth about it
for feot or two each way. The drill is then withdrawn
and new thrust. made two or three feet from the first,
and so on till the whole line of frozen pipe has been
gone over. Thus one or two hundred feet of frozen pipe
may be thawed out in day at the expense of two or
three men’s wages, one-eighth of ton of coal and the
hire of single horse, while to dig up that length in
winter with pick and shovel, and thaw it by building
fires upon it in the usual way. would cost ten times as
much, and the pipe, being re-covered with the frozen
earth, would stand good chance of freezing up again
harder than ever. |

If it becomes necessary to uncover the pipe for
repairs, any area may be speedily freed from frost by
such use of the drill as will suggest itself, and then
readily excavated. Hydrants occasionally freeze in the
‘‘foot,’’ below the valve, or in the supply pipe, between
main and hydrant, and few thrusts of the drill, so as
to deliver the live stream directly at the foot, have
quickly opened hydrants which had been vainly steamed

  Report of Water Board,

through the hose opening for hours. At an expense of

a few dollars for drill and steam hose, any water board

having the use of steam fire engine can verify the statements above made. There is no doubt that this use of

steam for winter excavations can be applied for many

other industrial purposes with great economy of time

and money, but to those in charge of water works, beset

by the clamor of water takers whose supply has come to

an untimely end by reason of frozen pipe—frozen,

nobody Knows just where, only that it is somewhere

beneath four feet or more of adamantine frost—such a

device as the ‘‘frost drill’? described will be found indispensable, when finally tried, and its use will also have :
a happy effect on the account for repairs and main- |
tenance.”’ |

The only change from the foregoing description which |
we would recommend is to have the ‘“‘frost drill’? open |
full size at the nozzle instead of being drawn down to |
one-half inch. |

continued with good results, many additions and alterations of fixtures, leaky faucets and defective plumbing
causing great waste of water, are reported by the inspector. We feel that some means should be devised to
prevent defective plumbing in buildings. This is serious and growing evil, and results in increased expense

the city also, and what is of far greater importance, it
imperils the health and lives of the occupants.

Report of Chief Engineer.
ee
Tu the Honorable Mayor and Members of the City
Government :

GENTLEMEN :—I have the honor to submit my first
annual report of the Fire Department for the year ending December .

Annexed will be found statement of the expenditures
of the department under the different appropriations,
rolls of companies, bearing names, ages, occupations
and residences of the members of the Department list
of all fires during the year, together with cause, damage,
insurance paid, etc.

‘The force of the department is as follows: Chief and
five assistant engineers, six drivers, three engineers of
steamers, three stokers, and one hundred and twentytwo call men, making total of one hundred and forty
men. |

The apparatus consists of four steam fire engines, two
hook and ladder trucks, six hose reels and Chief's
wagon, all in first-class condition.

During the year the department have responded to
thirty-four alarms, the principal fires being at the Massasoit Paper Company’s mill and. the Prentiss Wire
Mill The total insurance upon property endangered by
fire was damage insurance paid
$ loss .

During the year have made tour of inspection of
the different manufacturing establishments of the city,
and through the courtesy of owners and agents received

  Fire Department.

a great deal of valuable information in regard to the
way the corporations are equipped for fire protection. I
found the majority of mills well equipped with apparatus and the men in charge of same capable and efficient.
I also made note of dangerous buildings, elevators,
hatchways, stairways, fire escapes, and everything that
might cause injury to firemen in the discharge of their
duty. It isa well known fact that firemen, as arule,
will go where they are ordered, and men guing into a
building full of flame and smoke are liable to injury by
falling down elevators, open hatch or stairways. considered it my duty to familiarize myself with the dangerous places, and thereby be able to warn my men
when in dangerous localities, and not send them blindfolded into buildings where men should not be sent.

During the year have caused to be drawn up set of
rules and regulations for the government of the department. The same were approved by both boards of the
city government, and trust that they will be acceptable
to this year’s administration, together with such altera- —
tions or amendments as we may deem proper to submit
for your consideration.

I desire to make the following recommendations for
the coming year:

First. The placing of seventy-five more fire hydrants
throughout the fire limits. find that plenty of
hydrants greatly facilitate operations at fires, and in the
end cheaper than hose.

Second. The purchase of new horse hose wagon for
Mt. Tom Hose Co. at once; also the building of new
engine-house adjacent to the site where the present Mt.
Tom house now stands during the coming year, as it is

. highly important that the reserve steamer be placed
there for the better protection of the large number of
mills on the lower level canal.

Third. The appointment of an engineer and stoker to

Fire Department.  
run the Lafrance Steamer (reserve), as in case of large
fire the steamer, without an engineer and stoker, would
be practically useless.

Fourth. The purchase of feet of cotton, rubberlined hose. find this hose to be better adapted to our
wants than any other.

Fifth. would also recommend the drawing of fire
maps, showing water-ways, pipes and hydrants, the
same to be framed and hung in each engine-house, that
the firemen may become more familiar with the location
of hydrants, etc.

The expenses of the department for the year are as
follows: Repairs and contingent, including the purchase
of the new steamer,  pay of members,  salaries, water, High street
engine-house, repairs on Relief house,
$  making total of from which
must be deducted the prods from the sale of the old
High street house.

I can safely say that the efficiency of the department
at the present date will well repay for the outlay. During the year swinging harness have been adopted, and
the department horses have been trained to take their
places by their respective machines, the average time
occupied in hitching, from the time the gong strikes, is
seven seconds, which everyone must acknowledge is a
decided improvement over the old system.

I am happy to be able to report that no serious accidents occurred during the year in this department.

I am sorry to have to report two deaths in the department during the year. Daniel Harmon, driver of Reliance hose wagon and Richard Dunn, engineer of Relief
steamer, both valuable members of the department.

The discipline of the department is all that could be
expected. During the year only one member of the
department was discharged for insubordination. The

  Fire Department.
attendance of members at fires during the year was good,
in fact all could ask for.

In conclusion, wish to tender my sincere thanks to
the officers and members of the department for the
prompt, able and willing manner with which they have
responded to the calls for their assistance. My assistant
engineers have my full appreciation for the promptness
with which they have responded to all demands made
upon them. To the gentlemen constituting the joint
standing committee on fire department am under
obligations for the cordial support and endorsement of
all matters tending to the improvement of the department. To the Honorable Mayor and members of the
city government, for their continued liberality to the
financial wants of the department, my thanks are especially due. To the Chief and member of the police force
I will tender my sincere thanks for the faithful manner
jn which they have rendered service at fires in protecting
property and in preserving order.

Respectfully submitted,
JOHN T. LYNCH,
Chief Engineer.

Report of Overseers of Poor.
- To His Honor, the Mayor, and the City Council of Holyoke 

The Overseers of the Poor respectfully submit their
annual report as required for the year ending November
 th,  Our expenditures for the year show some
increase over those of previous years, on account of
increase of the Insane and of large number being out
of employment. Many widows left with large family
of small children with no employment and ro means of
support, many old persons who have been able to earn
enough to support themselves, but now with nothing to
do have been obliged to call for aid, and we have fur
nished them food and clothing to prevent them from
suffering. Wecan shut our eyes and close our ears to
the cries of the unfortunate and destitute, but Statute
law and public policy demand that this class shall not
only be heard, but their claims investigated. There is
another class, where the heads of the family are intemperate, they are arrested and frequently pay fines for first
and second offence, but for the third are sent to jail for
six months or more, and the family must be cared for
by the city, we have had anumber of such cases the past
year. As the number of paupers are increasing so fast
every year we are of the opinion that the time has come,
that the city should have an Almshouse, and we would
recommend that the city purchase piece of land and

Report of Overseers of Poor.  
erect suitable and comfortable house thereon, for the
reception of our poor, believing it would be an advantage to the city.

The receipts for the year from all sources are as
follows :
From State of Massachusetts previous
to July, . 
From other cities and towns,  
From Val Moquin,  
Appropriation by City Council  
Transfer,  
Overdrawn,  
———. -— 
Or.
By amount as ordered by Overseers
of the Poor, .

Report of Inspector of Milk.
To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen:

I have the honor herewith to submit the following
report, as Inspector of Milk for the city of Holyoke,
for the year  :

Total number licenses granted since Dec.  .
Total number granted since May divided as
follows: To stores  to peddlers  .

I have paid into the city’s treasury as license fees
received, .

The amount of milk sold daily, is in round numbers
  quarts, of which quarts are new milk, and
  skim milk, the total valuation per year being a
little over .

Total number of inspections made— .

Of which the larger part were chemical analyses, the
record of which is appended to this report.

The following determinations were made in each case:

Reaction,

Specific Gravity at degrees F. Fat.
Record of the Lactometer, Ash.
Total Solids, Water.
Solids not Fat. Color.

These extended analyses were made in order thata
more accurate and complete knowledge of the milk furnished by different dealers might be obtained, than by
a superficial inspection. This number of inspections
would not average two to each milk dealer in the city.

  Report of Inspector of Milk.

Obviously such method may justly be criticised as
wholly inadequate to the work which ought to be done.
In order to make this office truly efficient, every
dealer should be visited at least once month, thereby
necessitating about one thousand inspections during the
year.

My method of analysis has been as follows :—I have
taken four-cubic-centimeter pipette, which have
learned by proper manipulation will deliver four grammes of milk. With this instrument introduce the
above amount of milk into perfectly flat bottomed
platinum dish having diameter of about two and onequarter inches and straight walls. The dish with its
contents isthen placed upona water bath and evaporated
to dryness, requiring about one-half hour. Next it is
placed in an air bath and kept at temperature of 
degrees C. for two hours; the contents of the dish are
then weighed as total milk solids. The fat is removed
by successive treatment of the residue, which is very
thin layer on the bottom of the dish, with petroleum
naphtha, degrees, B. This is decanted three times,
which have found by experience to be sufficient for the
removal of all the fat, excepting perhaps little which
may have crept over the edge of the dish and may be 
removed by washing with petroleum naphtha from wash
bottle. The part remaining is then weighed as solids
not fat, and the difference between this and the éotal
solids gives the fat. The remaining contents of the dish
are now incinerated and the resulting mineral matter
weighed as ash.

The average percentage total milk solids obtained
from my analyses is  The average percentage fat
 The average percentage solids not fat  The
average percentage ash. .

Inthe majority of samples taken, the reaction has

been very slightly acid, but Ido not consider that this

Report of Inspector of Mitk.  
is the necessarily normal condition of good milk, The
reaction gives fair indication of its age. Freshly
drawn milk gives feeble acid reaction due to the
presence of little carbonic acid; as this passes off, it
gradually becomes neutral, then alkaline, due to the
presence of the alkaline phosphates; at this stage, lactic
fermentation sets in, the milk grows sour, and the casein
becomes curdled because it is insoluble in acids.

The specific gravity of milk is its density relative to
the density of pure water at degrees F. Thus, milk
having specific gravity of means that it is three
one-hundredths times denser or heavier than an equal
volume of water at degrees F. Now since the specific
gravity of pure milk seldom varies from for the
lower limit, and for the higher, this fact has been
made use of in the specialized specific gravity bulb—the
Lactometer.

The Lactometer is of some use in the examination of
milk when manipulated by an experienced person, but
its design is for simple test to be made by any one,
and as such it is failure. sample is suspicious when
it falls outside of either of the limits. lower gravity
than isa pretty sure sign of watering, and above
 that the milk in question has been skimmed.
Therefore it becomes quite possible for milk dealer who
is skilled in the sophistications of milk, to take rich
milk which the Lactometer would condemn, skim the
cream, thereby raising the specific gravity so that he
could then introduce certain amount of water and have’
a standard miik as tested by the Lactometer.

I am frequently asked—‘‘By what means do you
ascertain whether sample of milk is pure?’’ My
answer is this:—The composition of healthy cow’s milk
is fairly constant, certain ingredients varying only
between very narrow limits. The dotal milk solids
varies from to per cent. The fat, which is per  Report of Inspector of Milk.
haps the most variable, lies between about and  
per cent. The solids not fat usually lie very near  
and the ash between and  These constituents
may be altered, especially the fat, by the kind, quality
‘ and amount of feed. The nature, disposition and breed
of the animal also affect the quality of the milk.
Experience with different milks soon teaches one to be
able to judge when these bounds have been over-stepped,
and to pronounce on the quality of the milk. sample
may be pure and yet be of very poor quality. To decide
whether sample is legally pure milk or not, is very
easy matter, since the statutes provide that ‘‘In atl prosecutions under this chapter, (Chap.  Sec.  Acts of
 ,) if milk is shown upon analysis to contain more
than per cent of watery fluid, or to contain less than
  per cent of milk solids, or to contain less than per
cent of milk solids exclusive of fat, it shall be deemed
for the purpose of this chapter to be adulterated.”’ Any
milk therefore not conforming to this act is not legally
pure. As to whether this act is constitutional, and what
the decisions of the courts have been, and whether or
not this is too high standard, have nothing to say at
present.

Such chemical analysis as have outlined, and
which for every practical purpose that can be employed
is sufficient to detect most any form of adulteration
commonly resorted to, is nevertheless inadequate in
some respects. We cannot usually learn some very
important things by an examination of the milk. The
cow may not be in good health for some reason—there
may be some affection of the udders—the food and care
of cows may be such as to affect the quality of the milk;
such things can seldom be detected by an analysis of the
inilk and yet as affecting the consumers, they are of
vastly more conseqnence from sanitary point of view
than watering or skimming. The only way to make

Report of Inspector of Milk.  
milk producers cautious about such matters is for the |
inspector to be properly qualified and to visit the different dairies and farms from time to time and see that
proper care is exercised. On such visits samples of milk
freshly drawn should be taken for the purpose of analysis. The records of such analyses would furnish true
and accurate knowledge of the composition of milk for
scientific and legislative purposes.

The record appended cannot be relied upon for this
since the samples were collected of the dealers and are
not authentic.

I have not found any occasion for entering complaint in court for the sale of adulterated milk; only
five or six such cases have come to my notice, and in
accordance with my plan, these have been duly and
officially notified that in case second sample of similar nature is obtained, prodings against them will be
instituted forthwith.

I have taken great care to see that the names, residences and number of the license were legibly placed on
each dealer’s carriage as is required by law before granting the license. During warm weather, also assumed
the right and considered it part of my duty, inasmuch
as the milkmen came under my supervision principally,
to look somewhat after the cleanliness of their wagons
and cans, and to prevent the carrying of swill and milk
side by side.

On the whole, have to report that the milk supply
of this city has been very fair—better think than could
usually be expected under the meagre supervision which
I could give it.

Although the statutes provide that the inspector of
milk shall also inspect butter and cheese, have done
nothing with them for lack of money.

In conclusion have to say that all of this work of
which have given you an account, and very much

  Report of Inspector of Milk. —
more, including consultations, correspondence, traveling
expenses, etc., of which make no detailed statement,
the use of my laboratory and apparatus—all of this has
been done and furnished foc It is plain to any
one that this amount is nothing to what it should be for
the care of so important an article of food, and upon
which so much depends.

Gentlemen, this is very important matter into which
I have tried to give you little insight, and only ask
for consideration in proportion to the knowledge which I
give you. On this basis, and in proportion to the compensation paid your laborers for the service rendered
by them, ask you to pay for the service required
of this office. Feeling confident that presentation of
the facts will sufficiently appeal to your judgment and
actions in the future hereby rest the case. !

Respectfully submitted,

Inspector of Milk.

Report of Inspector of Vinegar.
————a 
To the Honorable the Mayor, and Board of Aldermen:

GENTLEMEN :—I have the honor herewith to submit to
you this report of my doings as Inspector of Vinegar for
this city during the past year.

To the majority of people, it doubtless seems as if the
legislature were trying to see how many tomes of law
they could turn out, when they observe the enactments
relating to so trivial and one may say unimportant article of consumptionas vinegar. Butfrom my standpoint,
one can easily see that the restrictions of the law materially arouse the manufacturers and merchants; and if
every consumer of this condiment could realize what a
chance there is to adulterate, and to impose upon them
under the guise of vinegar, worthless stuff made from
an abundant supply of refuse and vile material, they |
would see the wisdom in making such laws.

There has been every gradation of adulteration, from
the simple dilution of sulphuric acid to the farmer who
throws few pails full of water over his cider mill cheese
to press out little more juice, and then complains that
no one can make cider vinegar of the strength required
by law.

Let us look in general way at the nature of some of
the vinegar which comes into this city. We find fruit
vinegars, white wine vinegar, cider vinegar, and ‘‘cider’’
vinegar, XX vinegar and vinegar. The fruit vinegars
are advertised with showy pictures of luscious fruit,
which is an inexcusable deception on the face of it, as |

  Report of Inspector of Vinegar.

these vinegars are made from corn usually, and are
likely to contain chloride, sulphates, iron, and sometimes arsenic.

Wine vinegars, properly called, are those made from
genuine wines, (I dare say that none of this can be found
in Holyoke,) but the kinds which are common here are
made from refuse from starch and glucose factories,
and distilleries mostly.

The ‘‘cider’’ vinegars are the same with little coloring matter usually, and sometimes with the requisite  
per cent of cider vinegar solids obtained from cider mill
cheese. The XXX vinegars and vinegars are only variations of some of these.

Chap.  Laws and Resolves  .

‘All vinegars shall be without artificial coloring matter, and shall have an acidity equivalent to the presence
of not less than four and one-half per cent by weight of
absolute acetic acid, and in the case of cider vinegar
shall contain in addition not less than two per cent by
weight of cider vinegar solids upon frll evaporation
over boiling water, and if any vinegar contains any artificial coloring matter or less than the above amount of
acidity, or, in the case of cider vinegar, if it contains less
than the above amount of acidity or of cider vinegar
solids, it shall be deemed to be adulterated within the
meaning of this act.”’

This states what is principally required of vinegar.
Although this does not cover all that is required, have
found here the principal source of difficulty. have
made the following determinations:

Acetic acid.

In case of cider vinegar—the residue obtained by
evaporation over boiling water.

Detection of heavy metals, if any.

Detection of free or combined hydrochloric acid and
sulphuric acid.

Report of Inspector of Vinegar.  

The nature of the flame when particle is burnt ina ,
platinum loop

In cider vinegar the malates.

In determining the acetic acid, have used normal
solution of caustic Sodium or Potassium and titrated
the vinegar directly using Phenolphtalein as an indicator, taking the precaution first to ascertain if the sample in question contains free mineral acids, which would
vitiate the results.

For the solid residue, have taken cubic centime.
ters, which, as the specific gravity is from to  ,
would ensure full weight of grammes. This is evap.
orated in shallow porcelain or platinum dish to constant weight and the weight of the dish then subtracted.
The results are calculated to percent by removing the
decimal point one place to the right.

For detection of hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid
either combined or free, Silver nitrate and Barium
chloride are as matter of course the re-agents to
employ. If vinegar contains only traces of these,
there is no need of proding farther. Should it contain an apparent appreciable quantity of either of the
above acids, the mode of procedure is to take definite
quantity of vinegar placed in platinum dish, and
titrate with standard alkali, noting the amount required;
then evaporate to dryness and carbonize at gentle heat
to avoid reducing the sulphate to oxide. If the free
acid originally present is wholly organic, the ash will
contain an equivalent amount of alkaline carbonate,
requiring an amount of standard acid for its neutralization exactly equivalent to the amount of standard alkali
originally added to the vinegar. Any deficiency in the
amount of standard acid so required is due to free mineral acid originally present in the vinegar. Pure cider
vinegar should give pure Potassium flame when ignited
in the platinum loop. The remaining details being
usually of less importance, will omit here.

  Report of Inspector of Vinegar.

It will be seen by the examination of the record of the
vinegars which have tested, at the end of this report,
that if sample is not straight, it is usually revealed in
the amount of solids or acetic acid which it contains. |

During the year, have inspected samples, per
cent falling below the standard amount of acid required,
and per cent below the standard residue required of
cider vinegar.

It has been my custom to warn at least once, the person from whom an adulterated sample has been obtained,
before entering case for prosecution. On the first of
October, after having taken up large number of samples
of vinegar of which over per cent were gross adulterations, decided that would prosecute, and accordingly
entered complaints against nine of the offenders, all of
which cases are still pending. It has been frequently
complained to me that the requirement of four and onehalf per cent of acetic acid was too high standard.
For all such have no hesitation in saying that any
standard at all would meet with their displeasure. We
have as low standard as any country which has estab.
lished any standard. In England, the vinegar of the
Bristol Pharmacopoeia must contain at least per
cent of absolute acetic acid. The ‘‘proof vinegar’’ of
the excise contains per cent. In Germany per cent
is required. In Prussia at least per cent. In Austria
 in Belgium  in France to  and the United
States per cent. Therefore it is fair to conclude that
vinegar of good quality does not contain much less than
  per cent of acetic acid, and vinegar as low as per
cent is unfit for use, and to be called by the name of
vinegar.

Doubtless one of the reisons why the farmers in this
vicinity who supply most of the cider vinegar used here,
have difficulty in making it of the required strength,
is because they lack the knowledge necessary to make

Report of Inspector of Vinegar.  
good vinegar. Proper care and treatment are as neces- :
sary to make good vinegar as anything. It is quite
possible to go through the process of making it and
at the end have lost what you started out to obtain.

If grocers would take as much care in buying vinegars
as they do in selecting teas and other commodities they
would have little trouble in getting cider vinegar if they
wanted it. With little observation, one can tell a
cider vinegar nine times out of ten by simply smelling
of it. ,

The partial record of analyses of the samples of vinegar which have collected during the year, and which
are attached to this report, shows on its face the quality
that has been sold Still my report is report of progress in the right direction, and have no doubt in a
little time, by judicious management, the public may
feel sure of getting cider vinegar of good quality when
they ask for it.

The  which have received is no more an equiv- .
alent for this work than for the inspection of milk; and
unless proper equivalent is granted me, cannot accept
a re-appointment.

Report of the Inspector of Petroleum.
—+ ;

To the Honorable, the Mayor, and Board of Aldermen:

I herewith submit my report as Inspector of Petroleum.
Although received my appointment in February it was
not until about the first of April that did any work.
This intervening time was spent in getting ready. I
plainly foresaw that I, being the first recognized inspector the city ever had, would meet with an opposition at
the start, and in this was not mistaken. The statute
law expressly prohibits the sale at retail of petroleum
oils for illuminating or fuel purposes, unless it has been
inspected by an authorized inspector of this Commonwealth, and has flashing test not lower than deg.
F., and an inflammable test not lower than deg. F.,
when tested in the Taglibue open-cup instrument. It
seems to most people that the inspection of kerosene
should be made while the oil is in the hands of the
wholesale dealer, but asthe law did not extend to them
they at first refused to have the inspection so made,
although proposed to doit by the car-load at cents
per barrel. My course then was to inspect it with the
retail dealers, for which was authorized by the city to
collect  cents for the first barrel at given inspection,
and cents for each additional barrel. This method
rigorously followed up, soon brought the wholesale
dealers to terms, with whom most of the inspections are
made at the present time. ‘The fee which receive from
them is five cents per barrel and it is their custom to

Report of Inspector of Petroleum.  
charge over to the retailer fee of ten cents for such inspection, thereby making profit of five cents per barrel
off the inspection.

As the result, have to say that it has driven all of
the low test oil out of the city, where it has been sold
for illuminating purposes, because it did not meet the
requirements of safe oil. have very seldom found a
barrel of oil which would stand the test by which it was
branded. In the case of deg. oil, the average fire
test during the summer was about deg., but for the
last two months, it has fallen from six to eight degrees
below this, making the average fire test of deg. oil
at the present time about  deg. It is plain to see that
the reason for this is that in the increased demand for
kerosene during the winter months, the quality has
been degraded.

I can say confidently, that the inspection has had a
salutary effect during the past year, and while the law
dismisses sample if it passes the test above mentioned,
my tests have served to pick out the best brands of the
  deg. oil.

During the year, have made number of analyses
of the different oils which come to the city for the purpose of giving valuable information to the public regarding the subject. At one time I[ collected large number
and variety of lamps and lanterns from the stores and
mills, and burned them for several hours in the condition in which [found them. At the end of this time, the
temperature of the room was taken and that of the oil in
each lamp. In every case, the temperature of the oil had
risen in greater or less degree above that of the surrounding atmosphere in the room. It will be plain to
see therefore, that when the surrounding temperature is

oil giving off an inflammable vapor at less than deg.

exhaustive system of tests. Let it suffice at present for
me to warn all against the use of low test oil (i. e.  
deg., deg., deg.), when the surrounding tempera.

well noted by our manufacturers, who use kerosene
largely for illumination. In no case do consider it safe
to light the machine room of paper mill with kerosene
of any ordinary quality.

During the coming year, shall hope to make large

its use in lamps and oil stoves of different kinds, for the
purpose of instructing the public how they may use
kerosene with safety.

All of which respectfully submit.

It is matter for congratulation that the city has been
spared the presence of any epidemic during the year
although sporadic cases of scarlet fever, diphtheria,
measles and whooping cough have occurred in various
localities. All such cases occurring in the crowded tenement quarters have been promptly quarantined as a
severe but necessary precaution against the spread of

contagious diseases, as the result abundantly proves.
It is further matter of congratulation that not single
case of smallpox has occurred in the city during the past
year, although peculiarly exposed to the contagion
from the constant stream of immigration from Canada,
where this disease has prevailed to frightful extent. This happy result is traceable, under Providence, tthe vigilance exercised in the past by the
Board of Health in the matter of compulsory vaccination, and the general co-operation of the citizens in complying to the regulations established by the Health
Department’ In this connection it is my pleasant duty
to acknowledge the efficient aid rendered by the local
physicians in reporting all cases of contagious diseases
and to the several truant officers for their vigilance in
carrying out my instructions for the prompt isolation of
such cases as came under my jurisdiction. In retiring
from the office of City Physician, which have had the
honor to hold for the past five years, wish to record
my sincere thanks to the officers of the various Boards
of Health with whom have been associated, for their
uniform courtesy and hearty co-operation in the discharge of my duties. also wish to appeal again
as in my previous annual reports, to the public
spirit and humane instincts of this community for
their prompt consideration of that pressing need, a
City Hospital. In most other respects Holvoke is
abreast of the foremost communities of this commonwealth, and devoutly hope that measure dictated
alike by prudent regard for the public health and the
proper and reasonable care of suffering humanity in our
midst, will not much longer remain unheeded or left, as
now, in great measure, dependent upon private charity. Respectfully yours,

J. J. OCON NOR,
City Physician.

To his Honor the Mayor, and the Board of Aldermen
and the City Council of the City of Holyoke.

GENTLEMEN: The following report of the Board of
Health for the year ending November is respectfully submitted :

The regulations previously established for the prompt
removal of filth from public and private premises have ,
been thoroughly enforced, supplemented by such sanitary measures as seemed necessary as wise precaution
against the apprehensions of cholera epidemic which
has agitated the public mind during the past year. This
has necessitated additional expense for extra teams and
men, and the work has been thoroughly and patiently
done under the supervision of the Health Officer, Mr.
John Bateson.

The expenditures of this department have been as fol-
lows :

Total, 
We have found it necessary to divide the city into two
districts, north and south of Dwight street, and to employ two persons with suitable teams for the removal of
swill and house garbage, at total cost of  for this
service, which seems in our judgment has been well spent
in securing the removal outside of the city limits of this
common danger to the public health.
Number of notices served during the year:
  privy vaults ordered cleaned.
  privy vaults ordered taken out.
  house owners ordered to enter sewer.
  cellars ordered cleaned.
  privy vaults ordered repaired.
  obstructions to alleyways ordered removed.
  manure heaps ordered removed.
  swine ordered removed.
  barn cellars ordered cleaned.
  tenement houses ordered plumbed and renovated.
  tenement houses ordered replumbed throughout.
  goat ordered removed.
  dead goats ordered buried.
  dead swine ordered buried.
The removal of night soil has been under contract
with the same party as last year, Mr. Thomas Bray, and
has been faithfully attended to; and the thorough use
of disinfectants has been insisted upon. At an expense
of over  compulsory vaccination was ordered in
the French district, and rigid inspection enforced of
all new arrivals from Canada, and quarantine measures
