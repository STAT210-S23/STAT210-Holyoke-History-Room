MAYOR'S ESS.
Gentlemen of the Board of Aldermen:—
The City of Holyoke enters on another year of municipal
life under exdingly favorable conditions. Its people are
prosperous as rule; its industries are thriving, and there
is everywhere evident the fact of substantial growth and prosperity.
| FINANCES.

As municipality it is one of that rather small group of
cities which manage their business on pay-as-you-go policy.
The results of this policy may not be manifest to any remarkable extent in any one year, but when number of years are
taken together, the value of the policy is apparent.

In the net debt of the city, leaving out the water
department, was Today it is decrease
of over  in eight years. During the same period the
valuation has inereased over while hundreds of

 thousands of dollars have been expended for municipal improvements, and the assets of the city are greater by over
$ This statement leaves out the water and gas and
electric departments which are all mercantile assets of great
value. It also reckons at par the Holyoke and Westfield stock,
whereas that stock is in reality worth much more than par.

The fiscal year closed with debts paid, and during the
year  was paid on serial bonds,  was put
into the sinking fund, long time bonds to the amount of  were paid off, while only  was borrowed.

The Holyoke and Westfield Railroad stock continues to
be good investment. This year the value of the property |

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS
was increased by an addition to the freight house, and it is
hoped that this, with other changes will enlarge the earning
capacity of the road. It seems to me that the time has come
when the books of the railroad should be audited by trained
and skilled auditor. |
GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT.
With the Gas and Electric Department the year was one
of progress. At the gas works the new holder was completed, which increases the storage capacity of the plant from
  to cubic feet. At the station, new  
K. W. Turbine generator was installed which, when the new
boilers are in place, will give rated steam capacity of  
horse power, maximum horse power, as against capacity of horse power when the plant was purchased.

The output of gas has increased per cent, and that of
electricity per cent.

The most notable event of the year was the reduction of
the price of gas to  per thousand. In the year before
us the price of street lights will be reduced to  per
light, the lowest price in the state. The success of this department in the four years of its operation by the city has
been almost phenomenal, and the fact that it is suecess means
much for the present and future well-being and prosperity of
the city. ;

} i
WATER DEPARTMENT.

The past year with the water department has been
marked by the filling and overflowing of the high service
reservoir. This reservoir has storage capacity of gallons, and is thus not only source of strength to our
water supply but is also one of the most beautiful reservoirs
to be anywhere found. The excellent condition of our water
supply was well demonstrated at the time of the recent danverous fire.

en

| MAYOR’S ADDRESS  
BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.

The Board of Public Works has had busy year. The
Ward Two school was pushed well toward completion. The
already splendid sewer system of the city was still further
improved. Over  was expended in permanent street
work, and the routine work of the department received careful

. attention.

In the year before us the Jackson street underpass should ,
be begun and finished, goodly amount of permanent street
work should be done, city yard be built, the Highland Engine House be repaired, and the advisability of. an overhead
foot bridge near the mills of the National Blank Book Company should be considered.

SCHOOL DEPARTMENT.

I still believe that the schools are the most important city
department. At present the School Board is having the rather
difficult problem of being obliged to perform its work in some
quarters with insufficient facilities. The new school in ward
two will help matters to an extént but im the near future,
further provision for pupils must probably be made. The expense of conducting the schools yearly grows greater and the
per capita outlay seems rather high. think, however, that
the School Board will do what it can to keep this expense
within reasonable bounds, and the taxpayers certainly have a
right to expect no less result from the Board.

FIRE DEPARTMENT.

The Fire Department keeps at its usual high standard.
The officers and men are entitled to the highest praise for the
ability, courage and energy displayed by them at the McAuslan and Wakelin fire. During the year the firemen received :
an extra day off with the understanding that this year the
matter of increased pay would be taken under consideration.

While the finances of the city do not warrant an imme  MAYOR'S ADDRESS |
diate increase in the pay of the firemen, certainly not in the |
first part of the fiscal year, think the Commissioners might |
devise some scheme which will give the members of the department reasonable increase in compensation as fast as
the financial condition of the city will permit.
, POLICE DEPARTMENT. .
There has been little out of the ordinary in the work of
the Police Department during the year. The number of serious crimes committed in the city continues to be small. Life
and property are well protected, and are reasonably secure,
and the good order of the community is everywhere manifest.
While there is always much to eriticize in any police department, and there is always room for improvement, we should
not forget the very great amount of faithful service and real
good which is accomplished by the men on the force. |
PARKS.
The Park Board has begun the improvement of Riverside
Park which already gives promise of being most useful and
beautiful outing place. This year, work is planned not only
for this park, but for other parts of the system. believe it
is good business policy to purchase land for parks and playgrounds as we may be able to afford it.
'
SEALER OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. ,
The work of the sealer of weights and measures has virtually made of this branch new department. His efforts ,
have resulted in advantage to the citizens, and his department :
is rated as second to none in the state. |
THE BOARD OF HEALTH.
The Board of Health attends well to the general health
of the city and the absence of spreading disease and conta, gion  ample proof of the efficiency of this department. \

MAYOR'S ADDRESS  

Of the other departments there ean be little but words of
commendation.

The City Auditor is every year making his work of more
value to the city.

The Assessors get along with about as little friction as possible. ,

The Overseers of the Poor with the City Physician have
been careful and painstaking, and the Treasurer, Tax Collector, City Solicitor and City Engineer have performed their |
duties in most satisfactory way.

As have studied the financial affairs of the city, have
noticed few tendencies which ought to be checked. One is 
the over-running of appropriations. There are only few
departments which are guilty of this, but do not think any
department should do it, unless it is absolutely and unavoidably necessary. Another fault is the increasing of fixed
charges beyond reasonable limits. It is easier to make than to
unmake such charges. Public officials ought to aim to give as
economical administration as is possible consistent with growth
and progress. Any other policy is unwise, and if persisted in
will result disastrously to the city.

There are other features connected with the general administration of the city in regard to which improvements
can be made. Personally am ready to do what can to
bring about any improvement, and believe this to be the disposition of nearly all of our city officials.
* Holyoke is one of the best, cleanest and most progressive
, manufacturing communities in this section of our country, ,
and to make its condition better in every way than it has been
in the past should be our aim in the year which opens before
us. |

REPORT OF |
FIRE COMMISSIONERS.
OFFICE OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS

Ho.LyoKE, Mass., Dee. .

To the Honorable Mayor and City Council:
GENTLEMEN: Your Board of Fire Commissioners take
. pleasure in presenting their report for the year ending

December .

The Board organized January by the election of
Charles L. Newcomb, as chairman, G. J. Prew, as vice-chairman
and John Hildreth as secretary. Your Commissioners have

: held twenty regular and many informal meetings during the
past year.

The year just closed has been very satisfactory one from
a fire department standpoint, fires and alarms with a
total loss of only  tells story of successful firefighting of which the city may well be proud, for every one
of these fires had in them the seeds of serious fire, and but for
the prompt and skillful work of your firemen, might have
resulted in conflagration such as some of the cities in New
England have had.

The total insurance paid on all fire losses for the vear
was leaving net loss to our citizens of only
$ or an average loss per fire of only This is a
remarkable showing and justifies the action of the Board of
Underwriters in reducing the rates on account of efficiency of

the Fire Department, and we believe it is good business
policy to make liberal appropriations for the Fire Department
because our citizens get their money back in decreased insurance rates, not to speak of the increased feeling of security

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS

every citizen must feel when he knows that the city is protected by well-managed and up-to-date Fire Department.
This is what your Commissioners are trying to give the city,
and to enable them to do this, liberal appropriations must be
made. The rapid growth of the city and the increasing
number of large apartment blocks with their dangerous wooden
back verandas that are being erected, make it necessary to
keep increasing the size of the department. This year’s work
of the department serves to confirm the action of the city in
changing from call to permanent department. To the |
fact that we have always ready to respond at moment’s notice
a very considerable force of men, we believe is due the credit
of our very low fire losses. Minutes count tremendously at
the beginning of fire; after the fire has once gained headway
it is bound to result disastrously. We regret to say that one
Miss Bridget Fitzgerald lost her life on August as result
of an explosion of kerosene oil lamp. There were many
‘other accidents, but except the one to Chief Lynch of July  ,
none were of very serious nature. The accident to the Chief
was very peculiar one; he was struck by flying piece of
timber and had one rib broken and others fractured.

We take this opportunity to publicly commend the officers
and members of the Fire Department for the very excellent
work done by them the past year, and we fell sure that the
bravery and skill they have shown in the performance of
their difficult and dangerous work has not passed unnoticed
by the public generally. .

Many of the citizens whose premises have been endangered
by fire have shown their appreciation of the work of the
department in very substantial manner by adding considerable to the funds of the Firemen’s Relief Association.

We again ask the co-operation of the publie and of the |
Street Railway Company in keeping the streets clear as soon
as fire alarm is rung so that the firemen may be able to |
get to the scene of the fire with all possible despatch.

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS  ”

We have purchased two new exercise wagons and replaced

| the old Hose No. wagon with first-class, rubber tired,
modern wagon, and we have contracted for new first size
Amoskeag engine to replace Engine No.  This piece of
apparatus will greatly strengthen the department.

We have used the money appropriated for the department with as much economy as was consistent with good business management, and while the total amount expended is a
little larger than last year, this is accounted for by the inerease in the firemen’s pay, which increase your Honorable

 Board approved and your Commissioners gladly gave as we
believe it was merited.

We thank your Honorable Mayor and Board of Aldermen
for your liberal and courteous treatment, and would suggest
that it will be necessary to appropriate little more money

than last year to enable us to provide for the annual raise in
salaries under the rules of the department.

We make the following recommendations, some of which
we have made for many years, and we trust that this year
they may have more weight with your Honorable Board.

| First. We call attention once more to the necessity of
purchasing lot of land near the center of the city for a

new engine-house to replace House No.  We do not think it

; ‘is necessary to argue with your Honorable Board as to the

-* ssity of new house; the present engine-house is unsuitable from almost every point of view; first, the location is

bad, being on one of the most crowded thoroughfares in the

city second, the house is too small to accommodate the horses

apparatus and men needed at this important point. We have

to hire horses for Engine No.  and we have to hire room

for some of the apparatus. These items alone ought to econdemn this building, but there are many other reasons that

can be given. Real estate on IJIligh street is so valuable for

business purposes that it would seem to be good time to sell,

and nearly enough can be realized to build modern Fire

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS
Engine-house. Lots are growing more difficult to get and each
year that we delay adds to the difficulty.
Second. For the sixth successive year we recommend that
House No. be enlarged in accordance with the plans of the
city engineer; the extension should be placed on the west side
of the house. The conditions at this house are dangerous to
both men and horses, and we are afraid that, unless conditions
are improved, some serious accident will happen. We desire
to have accommodation at this point for sick or lame horses
and also to store the spare engines, so that when we want
them we may find them ready for use and not be liable to find
them frozen. We understand that the Board of Public Works
will be glad to make the changes called for at this house if the
necessary appropriations are made.
Third. We again recommend that new boiler be put on
Engine No.  and also on spare engine, and that the engines
be used as reserve engines and also used to pump out cellars
when they are flooded, as it is not wise to use our regular
engines for this purpose.
Fourth. We again recommend that House No.  situated
in Ward  should be sold and new, up-to-date engine-house
erected near the center of the ward. This ward is building
up so fast that unless steps are soon taken to secure lot it
will be practically impossible to get one.
Fifth. In making the appropriations, we trust that you
will make them large enough so that we can install, the coming
year, the Pompeii ladder drill. |
Sizth. The Commissioners also reeommend that the |
Board of Aldermen give the Fire Commissioners power to
tuke advantage of the state law, for the pensioning of firemen
who are incapacitated from performing the duties of firemen
from old age, or from injury, received by them in the performance of their duty as firemen. :
|

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS  

Seventh. We recommend that new Combination Hose
Wagon and two  -gallon chemical tanks be placed in House
No.  This district is crowded with large tenement blocks,
and good chemical engine would be invaluable, as the stairways in these blocks are sometimes narrow and crooked, and it
is very much easier to carry the light chemical hose up three
or four stories than the regular fire department hose.

Eighth. We recommend that the Board of Water Commissioners continue to put in new and larger hydrants, particularly in the Elmwood and Highland districts, and to equip

 them as far as possible with the Hercules independent gate,
and we want to bear testimony to the very liberal way in
which the Water Commissioners have carried out our suggestion of last year, both in the matter of new hydrants and in
equipping them with the independent gate. |

Ninth. We recommend that Engine No.  which is
located at the headquarters, and which has been in use twentytwo years, be refitted with new pumps and engine, which will
make it practically as good as new steamer.

Tenth. We believe that one of the next improvements to
be added to the Fire Department is the purchase of first-class
horseless vehicle for the use of the flying squadron. An

| apparatus of this kind is being successfully used by some of
our neighboring cities, and as we depend largely upon the
flying squadron for prompt and efficient work at all fires, it
would seem to us that we ought not to neglect any opportunity
to strengthen this branch of our department. In this connection we would also recommend the purchase of trolley
car for use on the street railway for the purpose of conveying
fire engines from one city to another, similar to the one owned
by the City of Springfield.

This branch of the Fire Department continues to be an
expensive necessity. We hope in the years to come that the
good work of the Water Commissioners, in putting mm new

hydrants, will make this branch of our work less costly. We
have bought feet of hose this year and shall be obliged
to purchase at least that much in the year to come. We
have been buying better grade of hose so that the amount
of hose on hand is larger than for some years past.

We have the following hose in our department :

The Board of Public Works have, during the past year,.
done very good work in the various engine-houses. There are
still some much-needed improvements, some of which we have

HAY AND FEED.

The stock of hay, bedding and feed is very low. We shall.

be obliged to renew the supply at once.
: HORSES.

We have forty horses in the department, most of which
are in excellent condition. We have been obliged every year:
to discard horses that have become unfit for Fire Department
service, and until there has been greater advance in the
manufacture of horseless carriages, we shall be obliged to continue with horses. number of Fire Departments are experimenting with the various forms of horseless vehicles, and we
will continue to watch the experiments with good deal of
interest.

A  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS
FIRE ALARM TELEGRAPH. :

We would again emphasize the necessity of putting the
‘wires underground in the thickly settled portions of our city.
Public safety demands that this be done, and the only reason
that this has not been done has been because of the expense
attending this change, but we believe that we cannot afford
much longer to risk the safety of the city by the use of the
overhead system. We depend so much upon the prompt action
of the Fire Alarm System that, if anything should interrupt
its successful working, the result might be disastrous. We
have urged for many years that appropriations be made for
this purpose, but as yet without result. The work of the

, Superintendent of this Department has been of the usual
high order.

REPORT OF THE |
Gas and Electric Department.
City oF HoLyoxKeE, Mass.
OFFICE OF GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT.
December .
To the Honorable, The Mayor, and the Board of Aldermen.

GENTLEMEN :—I hand you herewith the fourth annual
report of the Gas and Electric Department. There has been
a satisfactory inerease in the volume of business done from
the two lighting plants during the past year, the gain from
the gas works being eight and three-tenths per cent and that
from the electric station being thirty-five and six-tenths per
cent.

Since making the last report, the new gas holder at the
foot of Mosher street has been completed and put into use,
giving the gas works ample storage capacity for its manufactured gas for years to come. Of other apparatus added to
the equipment of the works, there has been only one exhauster
with its accompanying motor put in. This is used to force
the gas from the works into the new holder, so as to relieve
the pressure upon the apparatus that it threw upon it, owing
to its greater weight as compared with the older holders.
There have been laid two and five hundredths miles of gas
mains of various sizes together with one hundred and ninetyfive gas service pipes. There have been set gas meters,
making gain in the number of gas consumers of thirteen and
six tenths per cent.

  GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT

There needs to be installed during the coming year at
the works duplicate set of water gas apparatus in order to |
make sure that the works can always make gas enough to sup, ply the demand. In addition to this, the purifiers need enlarging, as shown by the state inspector finding more sulphur
in the gas than the law allows on three successive inspections.

The electric station is fast being gotten into shape to comfortably handle the constantly increasing business that is
erowding upon it. During the year, there has been installed
one K. W. turbo generator. Three new boilers have
been contracted for. Upon their installation, the station will
have rated steam capacity in its two steam turbines and its
two reciprocating engines of horse-power, and possible maximum eapacity of horse-power. This is in ad| dition to the horse-power in water power; but practically
is the rated capacity of the station, owing to the fact of there
not being an unfailing supply of water power attached to it.
The greatest demand upon the station the past year has been
about horse-power.

There have been added to the street lines twenty-one
miles of wire, forty-one transformers have been set, and
two hundred and thirty-seven meters have been added.
There has been gain of in the number of customers using:
electricity, or thirty-seven per eent imerease.

Owing to the good financial showing of the electric station, it is found practicable to reduce the price of street are
lights from  to  per heht per year, making reduction
in the amount the street department pays this department for
street lights of over  per year.

It has been the custom of this department to furnish the
first installation of meandescent lamps and to charge for renewals. Commencing as soon after January as the
lamps ean be procured, it will also furnish free renewals. In
addition, it proposes to furnish lamps of different rating.
In place of sixteen candle power lamp using fifty-six watts
per hour, it will furnish one that uses fifty watts per hour,

 GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT  
and it expects, by the first of May, to be able to furnish an
eighteen candle power lamp using only forty-five watts per
hour.

The following tables present data from the records of the
gas works:

Number of butter samples tested  
Number of vinegar samples tested ..  
Number of kerosene oil samples tested .. 
Number of prosecutions Bo  
Number of warningssent,milkk ...  
Number of warnings sent, wooden plugs 
The prosecutions were for selling milk in store without
first being registered. The fine was .
‘  samples of milk were tested and only warnings
sent for having milk below the standard, and it was necessary
to repeat the warnings in only very few eases.

By order of the Board of Health the license of one milk
peddler was revoked for having filthy wagon, and was renewed only when he presented wagon that was in good
condition.

Several were warned for having swill in-their wagons.
The warnings did not have to be repeated.

| The license of one store was revoked for being dirty, and
was renewed when the place was put in condition satisfactory to the Board of Health.

I have sent warnings to four peddlers for having wooden ,
plugs in their milk cans. There are practically no wooden
plugs used in this city now for milk cans.

In November Dr. Rose of the State Board of Health came

c, here to inspect the dairies that furnish the milk sold in this
city. went with him several days, but as he did not finish
his work eannot give full report now. ;

We found the dairies of this city in better condition
than in the places outside. |

VINEGAR.

Of the samples of vinegar tested, all except four were of standard quality. The four samples that were below the
standard were brought in for test by outside parties.

. INSPECTOR OF MILK, VINEGAR AND PETROLEUM  .
OLEOMARGARINE.
I have issued one peddlers’ and one store license for the ,
sale of oleomargarine. One suspected sample brought in
proved. to be old butter. |
PETROLEUM. ,
I have tested only tank cars of kerosene oil this year
against last year. This falling off is due largely to the
use of gas in its place. All this oil was up to the test
required by law.
: have had great assistance from the Ifealth Officer and
the Board of Health; also from my Collector of Samples. 
I wish to thank the City Marshal and the Patrolmen
for the help that they have given me. ,

REPORT OF OVERSEERS OF THE POOR  
| HOSPITAL DEPARTMENT.
The total number of patients receiving hospital treatment.
during the year was as follows:
Males ww    B:
Females Ck kk kk gg  
}  
Of the above number were sent to the hospital direct,.
the remainder were inmates of the institution.
The duration of treatment aggregated weeks, or an
average of weeks and five days for each patient.
The Board calls attention to the necessity of vegetable
cellar for the proper care and saving of vegetables raised on
the farm for the use of the inmates. At present there is no
cellar where the large amount of potatoes, cabbages and other
vegetables raised can be properly kept, which means buying:
in the spring and early summer. We believe that proper
cellar can be built at moderate expense, which will be the
means of quite saving in the department. We trust that
this matter will be taken up and completed as soon as possible.
Following is detailed statement of expenses at the |
City Farm:

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER
HIGHWAYS. .

The most important work done in the highway department during the year was the re-location and widening of
Pleasant street between Dwight street and Beacon avenue, .
and the paving of the same with macadam treated with Tarvia. This portion of Pleasant street from Dwight street for
a distance northerly of feet was only forty feet in width,

, This width, on account of the street railway track being

laid in the street, was considered insutticient and for many

' years past the advisability of widening the street had come
up for consideration.

The matter was however finally settled during the summer when this portion of the street was re-located and made
forty-five feet in width or the same width as the remainder
of the street from Beacon avenue to Hampden street. The
improvement, although some shade trees had to be cut down
or removed in the doing of the work, is very noticeable as it
has entirely changed the appearance of the street for the better and enhanced the value of the property abutting thereon.

| The macadam treated with Taryia, was not only laid on
the re-located portion of the street, namely, from Dwight
street to Beacon avenue, but also had been extended northerly
to Lincoln street, distance in all of about feet.

Another important work done during the year in the
highway department, was the re-paving of High street between Appleton street and Dwight street, and the re-paving
of the east side of Main street between Spring street and
Cabot street with Creo-resinate wood block.

In both places the paving blocks were laid on Portland
cement concrete foundation about five inches in thickness.

The pavements removed, namely the asphalt block on
High street and the granite block on Main street, had been
Jaid on sand foundations, but in the re-paving of these streets
it was thought advisable to use Portland eement concrete
foundations.

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER  

Dwight street, between Main street and the Boston and
Maine Railroad, was paved with Creo-resinate wood block laid
on Portland cement foundation, while Cabot street, from
High street to Commercial street, was paved with vitrified
brick block laid on the same kind of foundation.

Suffolk street, from Chestnut street to Walnut street;
South East street, from the Boston and Maine Railroad to Park
street; North East street, from Lyman street to Mosher
street; Lyman street, from North Bridge street to Center
street, and Elm street, from Lyman street to Hampden street,
were all macadamized.

Besides the above improvements, considerable work has |
been done on the country highways. The highway leading
from Holyoke to Westfield and that from Ashley Pond to
West Holyoke, has been greatly improved by the widening
of the roadways, the cutting down and removal of summits
and the making of better grades.

It is again recommended that Appleton street, from
Bh street to Dwight street, be paved; that Dwight street,

| from School street to Appleton street, and Hampden street
from Walnut street to Nonotuck street be macadamized.

) On account of the sharp grades in the two latter streets, |
gutters, much wider than the average, should be laid, so that
the surface drainage in time of storms, will be discharged
without causing washouts or damage of any kind to the maeadam. It is also recommended that that portion of the country highway leading from Holyoke to Southampton, opposite
the Jerry Doody farm so called, be drained and improved, as
this is the poorest piece of highway within the limits of the
eity of Holyoke.

| CURBING AND SIDEWALKS.

The work done under this heading consisted in the setting of new curbing, the re-setting of old curbing, the laying
of tar concrete and cement conerete sidewalks, and the resurfacing of old walks.

a

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER

In the latter there was more work done this year, perhaps, than in any previous year since the incorporation of the
city, the total number of square yards being  .

For the number of square yards of new sidewalks, and
the lineal feet of new curbing set and old eurbing re-set, together with all work done in connection with maintenance,
you are respectively referred to the report of the Board of
Public Works.

ACCEPTED STREETS.

The streets accepted during the year are as follows:

Sycamore street, from Hampshire street to Cabot street;
Ross avenue, from Maple street to South street; Lincoln
street from Taylor street easterly, distance of feet, to
Washington street; Washington street from Hampden street
northerly, distance of feet, to Lineoln street, (the
name of Washington street has been changed to Lincoln street
so that Lincoln street now extends from Hampden street to
Northampton street); Bowers street, from Appleton street

: to Pequot street; Samosett street, from the westerly line of
North East street to Center street; Winter street, from
Samosett street to Appleton street; Ross avenue, from South
Elm street to the Ranlet land; Poplar street, from Appleton
street to Cabot street; Cabot street, from Locust street to
Poplar street; Locust street, from Essex street to Suffolk
street, and North Summer street, from Mosher street to Ely
street.

For the alignments, measurements and grades of these
streets; as well as the alignments, measurements and grades
of the streets accepted each year since  together with an
alphabetical list of all streets accepted to date, see tables
further on in this report.

BRIDGES.

In regard to the bridges of the city, it is unnecessary to
repeat the recommendations made in previous reports for

|

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER  
some years past, namely, that new structure be built each
year until all the older or weaker structures are replaced.

Following isatabulated list of the bridges under the eare
of the city, together with the width of roadway, sidewalks
and areas of the same.

, REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER  
SEWERS. .

Considerable attention has been paid to the sewerage
system of the city during the year. The larger sewers, especially below the canals, were subjected to careful analyses
regarding their discharging capacities, and their efficiencies to properly drain the territories contributory to them.

In some cases the result of these analyses were astonishing.

} For instance, the sewerage system in South Holyoke .
bounded by Crescent street and the second and third level canals, has two outlets, discharging into the river, known as
the Sargeant and Jackson street outlets. The capacity of
these outlets is sufficient to drain the whole territory contributory to them, and not have any back-water damaging
cellars, except, what might occur in phenomenal storms, providing the drainage area of each outlet was proportional
to the discharging capacity of the outlet. But this has not
been the case as the Jackson street outlet, which has discharging capacity of at least fifteen times as large as the Sargeant street outlet, had only drainage territory contributory to it of about thirty acres, while the drainage territory
contributory to the Sargeant street outlet had about seventy
acres or about two and one-third times that of the Jackson
street outlet. In other words the smaller outlet. had about
thirty-five times more work to do than the larger outlet. A
most preposterous condition of affairs and one, which, of
course, suggested at once why flooded cellars located in the

drainage territory contributory to the Sargeant street outlet, were, in time of storms, becoming more numerous year

after year; for as the population increases so does the tax
on the sewer system also increase.

In order then to improve the sewerage of this territory, }
it was recommended that the sewer in Jackson street be extended in Jackson street from the alley west of Summer
street, and connected with the sewer in the alley west of Park
street, and with all the other sewers intereepted by it in its
course that sewer be laid in Hamilton street from the sewer

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER

in the alley west of Park street to Canal street, and thence in
Canal street to the Jackson street outlet. This latter sewer
to intercept and drain all the sewers crossing its courses; the
idea being to divert certain quantity of the sewage from the
Sargeant street outlet to the Jackson street outlet, and thus
more equalize the work of both outlets. Both recommendations were acted upon and carried out by the laying of  inch Akron pipe in Jackson street, and also  -inch Akron
pipe in Hamilton street as far as the Sargeant street outlet
with the intention of continuing this latter sewer, enlarged in
size, the coming year to the Jackson street outlet as recommended.

A sewer system had also been designed for the Coit tract,

go ealled, in Elmwood, the greater portion of which is now
completed, and will be entirely completed inside of couple
of weeks.

Plans and specifications had been prepared for the letting by contract of the uneompleted portion of the storm
water sewer commenced last year, namely, section (A)  
inches in diameter, extending from Appleton street through
Walnut, Suffolk and Pine streets to Hampden street; Section (B) inches in diameter, extending through Pine
street from Hampden street to Prospect street, and section
(C) inches in diameter, extending in Prospect street from
Hampden street to the Walnut street outlet, so called, at the
ice house.

In the eall for bids, the contractors were allowed to bid
on the construction of brick masonry sewer, in accordance ,
with the plans and specifications prepared by this department, or on the construction of re-inforeed concrete sewer
in accordance with plans and specifications prepared and
tendered by the contractor.

The bids on the latter kind of sewer were much lower,
and the contract was let to Rivers Young, Waillimansett,
Mass., who agreed to complete the contract on or before the
first day of December,  but who, owing to the difficulty

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER 
of procuring material for the work and other delays, have
been unable to do so.

All the sewers constructed during the year are given in
a tabulated list further on in this report, together, with their
alignments, lengths, depths and cost, ete., likewise lst of
the catch basins built, to which you are respectfully referred.

Besides these new sewers constructed, the old sewer in
the alley west of Chestnut street, between Dwight and Suffolk
street, had to be lowered, or more properly speaking new
sewer alongside of the old one had to be laid at lower depth
in order to accommodate some of the new buildings that are
now being erected, the cellar floors of which are much lower |
than those of the buildings erected when the old sewer was
constructed. |

The lowering of this sewer, together with requests made
for the lowering of other sewers for similar reasons, introduce new sewerage problem in our city which eventually
may take many thousands of dollars to solve. It might be
well, therefore, fot the city to carefully consider what such a
policy as the lowering of sewers may mean in the long run before generally establishing it.

It  again recommended that the Walnut street sewer
be extended, as proposed some years ago, to the Front street
sewer, and that the work be done the coming year, likewise
that the sewer system recommended for the Cleary tract, so
called, last year, be constructed the coming year.

When this small system is constructed, Holyoke will have
a sewerage system perhaps unparalleled in its completeness,
as it will then practically extend to and be within easy ass of every dwelling and building within the city limits,
from the Northampton line on one side to the West Springfield line on the other. Besides, when this is done, there will
not be more than twenty-five houses within the city limits, ineluding all suburbs, that will not be connected with the public sewerage system, record perhaps unique in any sewerage
system, not only in any town or eity in this country, but also
in any town or city throughout the world.

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER
CULVERTS.

The Maple street culvert was extended easterly one hundred feet and northerly two hundred feet. In
the past the extensions of this culvert were constructed of
brick and rubble masonry, the latter being used in the foundations and abutments, while this year the extensions were constructed wholly of Portland cement concrete masonry.

The work was done by contract, in accordance with plans
and specifications prepared by this department in such manner, as to allow the contractor to bid on rubble and brick
masonry and on concrete masonry.

As was shown by the bids, the construction of the culvert of the latter material would be the cheaper by  per
lineal foot, and consequently the contract was let to Daniel
O’Connell’s Sons of this city, who completed the work in a
satisfactory manner.

But the cost of the extensions of the culvert this year was
not only lessened by the use of concrete as material, but
in much greater degree, on account of the new design or
cross-section of culvert that had been prepared. »

: This design or eross section was planned after very
eareful and thorough study of all the conditions involved,
especially those bearing directly upon the yield of the territory drained by the culvert, and the intensity of this yield in
extraordinary or phenomenal storms.

As result the cost of the extensions was  per lineal
foot less than the cost per lineal foot of the extensions made
in  or total saving this year of as compared —
with the cost of the same lengths of extensions made in  ,
notwithstanding that labor and materials were much cheaper
at that time. |

The Engineering Department is usually looked upon
and treated as rather minor or irresponsible one in municipal affairs, yet, how much does the economie expenditure of
large sums of money depend upon the conception and method
of development of municipal engineering projects.

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER  

The thoughtful citizen and taxpayer must fully realize
this, and also realize that besides knowledge of the science
of engineering, vast amount of thought and study are required in even the simplest engineering undertakings, provided the best and most economic results are to be obtained
in return for the money expended.

PARKS AND LIGHTING DEPARTMENT.

In the early summer plans and specifications were prepared by this department for the extension of the Prospect
Park Terrace Wall.

However, owing to some negotiations pending with the |
Boston Maine Railroad Company, regarding the acquiring
of some land in order to straighten out the boundary line between the Railroad Company and the city, the Board of Park

. Commuissioners thought it advisable to postpone the doing of
the work for another year.

A large amount of engineering work was done in Riverside Park, which necessitated the services of one assistant
from this department during the greater part of the summer
and fall months. What contrast to few years ago when
the services of the Engineering Department were seldom or
ever required by the Park Department.

Two large maps, drawn to scale of two hundred feet to
an inch, one showing the locations of the gas mains and the 
other showing the locations of the electric power lines were
prepared by this department.

Besides this work other engineering services were ren- |
dered, such as locations, alignments, grades, ete., for street  
mains, on request of the Lighting Department.

WATER DEPARTMENT.

The most noticeable event in the Water Department, from
an engineering standpoint, during the year was the filling
and overflowing of the High Service Reservoir in the early
spring.

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER
| Although never doubtful for single moment of the success of this undertaking as outlined in my report to the
Board of Water Commissioners in  and before the work
was commenced, yet, the responsibility, entailing as it did
approximately the large expenditure of was such
that it caused no small anxiety to your engineer during these
years, while the reservoir was in course of construction, and
until it was finally filled with water. |
Besides, this anxiety was certainly not lessened anywise by the rumors set afloat from time to time derogatory
to the reservoir. |

Such rumors held that the reservoir bottom was seamy
trap rock incapable of holding water; that the Fomer reservoir water could not be discharged therein—in other words
that the laws of gravitation would not hold in this case,—
and that therefore the project would have to ultimately end
in failure and disappointment.

However, the filling and overflowing of the reservoir in
the early spring, and the discharging therein of the water
from the Fomer reservoir, have shown that the prophets of
failure and disappointment were false ones, and am now glad
to have an opportunity to publicly thank the members of the
Water Commission for the confidence expressed by them in
their engineer and in the success of the project, notwith- gtanding all the rumors heard by and statements made to
them, to the contrary.

The High Service Reservoir has not only filled and overflowed, but is one of the most beautiful reservoirs, if not the.
most beautiful reservoir in New England, statement to which
not only the residents of Holyoke, but those outside of Holyoke, who have visited the reservoir during the year, can attest. ,

. BUILDING INSPECTION.

Owing to the number of large buildings of great height
that are being erected nowadays in comparison with those
erected in past years, new building ordinance was conREPORT OF CITY ENGINEER dio
sidered necessary which would more fully define the duties
and powers of the building inspector and the manner in
which buildings should be. constructed.

The new ordinance was drawn up after months of careful
study of the matter by committee appointed by the Board
of Aldermen and passed by the Board of Aldermen, and became law on the third of October, last.

This new ordinance was unanimously demanded by the
publie at large, and since it was deliberately considered in
detail by the committee, who had kept in view all the time that
no undue hardships should be placed upon those interested in
the erection of buildings beyond that required for the safety
of life and the protection of property, it is unnecessary to
state that it is imperative on the inspector of buildings to enforce the law to the letter as the ordinance ordains.

And this is what shall be done, and it is hoped that the
owners of proposed buildings, architects and contractors, will
make every effort to comply with the law rather then try to
evade it, an occurrence which unfortunately has been too
often the case in the past.

Below is table showing list of the plans and specifications for buildings approved by the building inspector under
the old ordinance, except the last four on the list which were
approved under the new ordinance.

REPORT OF

BOARD OF HEALTH.

To the Honorable, the Mayor, and the Board of Aldermen:

GENTLEMEN: In comphance with the Public Statutes,
the Board of Health herewith submits for vour consideration
its twenty-sixth annual report. ,

The Board met for organization on the first Monday of
February, eleeting the following officers: Chairman, Dr. A.
B. Wetherell; secretary, Dr. Frank A. Woods.

GENERAL WORK.
The Board of Health takes advantage of the opportunity
 offered by its twenty-sixth annual report to congratulate the
publie on the general good health of the city, its freedom from
excessive contagious disease during the past vear, and its present sanitary condition. .

The Board still continues to exereise its powers for the
abatement of all nuisances prejudicial to health, and general
improvement of sanitary eonditions is evident throughout the
city.

The recommendations of former reports are again presented for your consideration, as follows:

First. The extension of the Walnut street sewer to a
point below the dam, and the elimination of all sewage from
eanals in their passave through the city.  The establishment of hospital for the eare of contagious diseases, especially diphtheria and searlet fever. The need of an institution
of this character  imperative. Third. The sanitary condition of Hillside hospital; bath and disinfeeting room should
be installed and proper dispcsal of sewage be made.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH
BAKERIES.

- Such inspections of bakeries as were deemed necessary
have been made, and in most eases these manufactories of food
products were found in satisfactory condition.

It was found necessary to close two bakeries during the
year, as in the opinion of the Board the sanitary conditions
and general surroundings were of character not condueive to
good health. One of these bakeries has since complied with
the requirements of the Board, the other remaining elesed.
| There are at present twenty-eight bakeries in operation in

| the city.
BACTERIOLOGY.

The Board has continued its existing system of bacte| riological examinations in all cases of diphtheria or suspected
throat trouble. Of one hundred and ninety-six cultures examined, one hundred and three were negative, thereby saving
considerable trouble and annoyance in quarantining people.

In addition to this work, the Board has made arrangements with the baeteriologist to examine, during the coming
year, sputa of all suspected cases of tuberculosis of the lungs
and the Widal test to be used in all eases of typhoid fever.
This places the possibility of diagnosis of the serious diseases
within the reach of all physicians without extra expense. :

UNDERTAKERS.
Thirteen leenses have been granted to engage in this
business during the vear.. The license of one .wndertaker was
revoked because of failure to comply with the laws of the eom  monwealth and the rules and reewations of the local board.
, SLAUGHTER HOUSES.

All manufacturers of sausage and prepared meat within the
eity have been granted lieenses by this Board. Sixteen licenses
have been granted for the manufacture of sausage, prepared
meat and slaughtering.

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH  

The supervision of these places of business has caused an
improvement in the character of the articles furnished to the
public for consumption.

BARBER SHOPS. |
| There exists very general desire on the part of most barbers to comply with the regulation of the Board, and the shops
as whole are found most satisfactory. Numerous inspections have been made during the year and it has been found
necessary to send twenty-three warnings for minor complaints.

In few eases there is indication that legal measures will
have to be employed or shops closed.

INSPECTOR OF MILK, VINEGAR AND PETROLEUM

: general inspection of all dairies supplying milk to the
city has been made during the year by representative of the
State Board of Health, and the Local Inspector. Wherever
cause for complaint has been found, the producer has been |
notified and such future action as will best result for pure
milk supply will be performed by the Board as the occasion

' presents itself.

The duties of the office are performed in most satisfactory manner, and the general quality of milk is up to the
standard.

The report of the Inspector of milk, vinegar and petroleum
 appended.

) BARNS AND LIVERY STABLES.

The Board has received all applications for the erection
and oceupaney of buildings to be used as barns. The premises |
in all cases have been viewed and general conditions given due ,
consideration.

Seven barns have been erected during the vear. .

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH |
- BOARD OF PLUMBING EXAMINERS. |

The examination and licensing of plumbers as required
by the laws of the Commonwealth has been performed by the
Board according to the provisions of the act. There have been
no examinations for master, but six for journeyman plumbers.

The report of the plumbing examiners is appended. —

VITAL STATISTICS.

The Board presents for your consideration the following
resume of the vital statistics for the year ending November  ,
 |

There have been reported during the year deaths and
sixty-nine still births, death rate of per cent per
thousand inhabitants, which compared with deaths and
ninety-five still births, death rate of per cent per
thousand, and reported during the year  shows an inerease this year of sixty-four deaths or three-fourths of one
per cent per thousand.

Table A, as appended, shows the comparative number of
deaths, still births and death rates for the past seventeen |
vears. It shows that during this period there have been  
deaths in. the city, an average of deaths per year with an
average death rate of per cent per thousand population. :

Table presents the number of deaths and still births oeeurring each month of the year, showing an average of seventythree deaths per month. The greatest mortality occurred in
August, when there were deaths, in July, when there were

ninety-three deaths, and in February, when there were ninety
deaths. The smallest curred in November, during which
month there were forty-five deaths, the smallest number of
deaths any one month for several years.

Table shows that of the deaths reeorded during
 or per cent were males and or per
eent were females. Of the sixty-nine still births, thirty-five
were males and thirty-four were females.

year, showing that of the deaths, or per cent
were under one year of age; and or per cent were
under five years of age, fifty or per cent died between the
aves of five and twenty years; or per cent between
the ages of twenty and fifty years: and or per cent

of we find that there have been during thirty-five
more deaths under one vear of age; forty-three more deaths

 under five years of age; nineteen less deaths from five to twenty
years of age; eighteen less deaths from twenty to fifty years
| of age, and-sixty-two more deaths over fifty years of ave.

various ages in the several months, and is interesting as showing the time of year in which the greatest mortality occurs at
the different periods of life.

find only sixty-six deaths from tubereulosis as compared with
elzhty-seven during and during  The number
of deaths from eancer remains very constant, there having

been thirty as compared with thirty-three last vear.

There has been an increase in deaths due to nervous

twenty-two from whooping cough.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH

| Report of the Health Officer.
To the Board of Health: |

GENTLEMEN: hereby submit report of your Health
Officer for the year  During the year minor nuisances
such as dirty cellars, yards and tenements have still decreased.
This in itself is an indication that the people of our city recognize the importance of sanitary surroundings and the relation they bear to the public health.

The number of old buildings still continues to decrease ;
the number removed during the year being four with action
pending on two.

During the year two places used for the manufacture of
ice cream were ordered closed, owing to their unsanitary condition.

The action of the Board of Aldermen in referring all applicants for the sale of fruit and vegetables, to this Board,
shows the advisability of their action.

It was found necessary to bring three complaints to the
Police Court, two were found guilty and one was discharged.
This was only done after repeated warnings.

I would recommend to the Board that some action be taken to amend the slaughtering laws of this state, so that all
eattle killed locally must be passed upon by the local inspector. My reason for this is that several cases of so-called bob
veal were seized and condemned, although officially stamped
by outside towns.

general condition of tenement property is good and it will :
compare favorably with any city of its size and conditions.

I also wish to congratulate the Board on the condition of
the Milk Department, which think is recognized by the citizens in general. This department is under the charge of Mr.
James K. Morrill, who has several times given me valuable
assistance.

In conelusion wish to return thanks to Dr. J. J. Moynahan, Marshal Wright and the members of the Police Department, and to the members of the Board for their courtesy
and co-operation, which has been of great assistanee to me in
my work.

Report of the Inspector of Plumbing.
To the Board of Health:

GENTLEMEN: As Inspector of Plumbing have the honor
of submitting the thirteenth annual report for the fiscal year
ending November .

All cases have complied with the requirements of the
Board.

The unusual amount of new work during the past year
shows the rapid growth of the work of this Department, and |
in conjunction with the examinations of imperfect plumbing
and nuisances pertaining to saine, places the department work

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
in its entirety on much larger comparative scale than in |
most cities of this size.

Three general inspections of barber shops have been made .
during the year and in most cases they have been found to
meet the requirements of the Board. Twenty-three warnings
of minor offenses were sent to owners of these shops, and am
pleased to state that all shons at the present time are in good
sanitary condition.

It would seem advisable that plans for all sewers from the
building line to house should be filed at the office of the Board
of Health, and permits granted before work is commenced. ,;
These sewers should be laid by plumbers or licensed drainlayers, and in all cases be inspected before being filled in. The
amending of that section relating to sewers in the Rules and .
Regulations of the Board of Health is,’ therefore, presented
for consideration. |

During the year it has at times been impossible or extremely difficult for your Inspector to give the necessary time
to the office, during the hour from one to two p. m. find that
many people desiring the services of this Department request |
that calls be made at this hour so they may be there in person,
thereby receiving more intelligent and comprehensive report of existing conditions. During busy times the value of
the hour may be annvreciated on new as well as old work. It
would, therefore, seem advisable to make the official office hours

. of the Inspector from eight to nine a. m., only. This’ has
been found necessary in most cities of our size and is general
throughout the state.

The recommendations of former years regarding house to
house insnection and the sanitary conditions of Hillside Hospital are again presented for consideration.

In conclusion desire to thank the members of the Board
for their courtesy and co-operation.

Respectfully submitted,
] F. L. AVERY,
. Inspector of Plumbing.

; REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.

The prosecutions were for selling milk in store without
first being registered, the fine was |

Two thousand and seventy-one samples of milk were
tested and only forty-two warnings sent for having milk below the standard, and it was necessary to repeat the warnings
in only very few cases. |

By order of the Board of Health the license of one milk
peddler was revoked for having filthy wagon, and was renewed only when he presented wagon that was in good condition.

Several were warned for having swill in their wagons; the
warnings did not have to be repeated.

The license of one store was revoked for being dirty,
and was renewed when the place was put in condition satisfactory to the Board of Health.

I have sent warnings to four peddlers for having wooden

  plugs in their milk cans; there are practically no wooden
plugs used in this city now for milk cans. In November Dr. Rose of the State Board of Health came

here to inspect the dairies that furnish the milk sold in this

| eity. went with him several days, but as he has not finished his work cannot give full report now. We found the
dairies of this city in better condition than in the places
outside. ,

VINEGAR.

Of the eighty-six samples of vinegar tested, all except
four were of standard quality; the four samples that were below the standard were brought in for test by outside parties.

OLEOMARGARINE.

I have issued one peddler’s and one store license for the
sale of oleomargarme. One suspected sample brought in 
proved to be old butter.

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
PETROLEUM. |
I have tested only seventy-four tank cars of kerosene oil
this vear against eighty-eight last year. This falling off  due
largely to the use of gas in its place. All this oil was up to the
test required by law.
I have had great assistance from the Health Officer and
the Board of Health, also from my Collector of Samples.
I thank the City Marshal and the patrolmen for the help
that they have given me.
Respectfully submitted,
JAMES K. MORRILL,
Inspector of Milk and Vinegar.

Report of Bacteriologist.
To the Board of Health, City. of Holyoke, Mass.:
GENTLEMEN: have the honor to submit the following
report for the year ending November :

During the past year there have been referred to me one
hundred and ninety-six cases for examination for the presence
of diphtheria bacilli. This number is ninety-one less than were
examined during the year of  .

It is worthy of attention to note that all but eighteen
cases were referred to the laboratory for diagnosis, .these
eighteen being examined at the time of release only. This

nwuuber probably includes some laryngeal eases, so that practically all of the eases of diphtheria during the year have been
examined at the beginning of the case.

I would like to again refer to the fact that the eases of
larvngeal diphtheria frequently do not show diphtheria bacilli
in the throat, unless membrane is present there, so that negative result of culture from these cases should by no means be
interpreted as indicating that the patient has not laryngeal
diphtheria. consider this very important point; namely,

“that laryngeal diphtheria must be diagnosed by the svinptoms,
unless accompanied by lesions in the throat, when the bacilli
may be found upon eulture.

REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF POLICE.  

The number of women arrested during the year is smaller
than usual. While drunkenness claims many victims it is satisfactory to note how few women have been convicted of other
grave offenses. We have sent nine women to the Woman’s
Reformatory Prison at Sherborn. They were for the most
part, women addicted to drink and had been before the court
several times during the year. We have placed one woman
and five wayward girls in the ‘‘Home of Good Shepard’’ at
Springfield, giving them an opportunity to reform and saving them from prison record.

In conclusion, wish to thank the Marshal, his assistants
and the members of the force for their courteous treatment
and ready co-operation in my work.

Respectfully submitted,
KATE MOYNIHAN,
Police Matron.

RECOMMENDATIONS.

I would respectfully call the attention of your Honorable
body to the Gamewell Police Signal System, most earnestly
recommending its installation, believing that it would be valuable addition to the equipment of this department. The
svstem now in use is owned by the New England Telephone
Company and is far from satisfactory.

The registering of duty calls has not always been positive in character, while the telephone service in many instanees has been so unsatisfactory as to enforce temporary
abandonment. The use of private telephones has been frequently called into the service of the department by the officers many times when it had been of the utmost nnportance
to acquaint patrolmen of their routes with valuable iformation. The poor service of our signal telephone has oeeasioned
very serious and unfortunate delays. In view of the importance of having system positive in its workings, earnestly
recommend that steps be taken to remedy the faults at an early
date.

In order to encourage residents going away on vaeations
and leaving their houses unoccupied to adopt the practice of
reporting the faet to the police, it may be well to state that of
the twenty-seven houses so reported to us during the past
season not one was entered or tampered with by sneak thieves.

REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF POLICE.  
CONCLUSION.
In conclusion, beg to express my appreciation of the
many courtesies extended by His Honor the Mayor, the Judge
and Clerk of the Police Court, and the members of this department during the year, and to thank them for the considerate
attention given to matters pertaining to this department, and
for the assistance which they have rendered. :
Respectfully submitted, )
J. SIDNEY WRIGHT,
City Marshal.

REPORT OF
Board of Public Works.
HouyoxkE, Mass., January .
To the Honorable, the Mayor, and the Members of the Board of

Aldermen of the City of Holyoke, Mass.: |

GENTLEMEN: The Board of Public Works herewith presents its tenth annual report, covering the various departments under its control. More work has been accomplished
in the departments the current year than has been done during any twelve months in the history of the Board.

While the progress upon the Walnut street storm water
sewer was not such as to accomplish its completion this year, |
as was hoped, the sewer will be finished early the coming

| spring and when placed in use we hope will relieve the congested conditions existing in the area that it is designed
to care for.

There have been unavoidable delays in the finishing of
the Ward Two school building, but present indications are
that it will be ready for use early in March, if not before.

) There has been large increase in the demands made
upon the Alley Department in the removal of ashes and
other refuse matter, which necessitated an additional appropriation to care for this work, and within short time it
will be necessary to employ still larger force in the removal
of ashes and garbage. There have been many new buildings
constructed, including apartment blocks, tenement houses and |
individual residences, that were the cause of the increased
draft upon this department.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.

It has been found necessary to extend the culvert at
Elmwood Park distance of some two hundred feet
westerly and one hundred feet easterly to provide room
for refuse matter from the city, and the Board has been
compelled to prohibit the dumping of debris from contractors’
plants and manufacturing establishments upon the east side
of Maple street, which has been reserved as dumping ground
for the use solely of the city departinents.

The public buildings have been well cared for during the
year and it is noted that the expense of their maintenance is
continually growing.

The loeation of the Ward One bath house has been
changed slightly, and owing to the construction of the new
Ward Two school building the bath house in that ward has
been abolished.

The expense in the lighting department, while larger, is
being kept lower than it otherwise would be were it not for the
reductions which are being made from time to time by the
Gas and Electric Department for the are street lights, the
gas hehts and the ineandescent electric lights. There are
at the present time larger number of street lights in use
than some few vears avo, with one-third less liehts.

A very good showing has been made in the highway
department, and much work has been done that is appreciated
by the public in general. The work performed last winter
or early in the spring from the West Springfield line northerly
along the Sprinefield road, and Northampton street to Bh
street, in hardening and working to the width of the roads in
many places, has been greatly appreciated by the people using
the same during the past summer. .

Not the least of the work the past year was the elimination of the grades and the widening of the road leading
from Northampton street in Elmwood, through Ashley Ponds,
to West Holyoke, which is used almost constantly by the
people of that section of the city, and also for pleasure.

The department accomplished much routine work on the
highways and the usual amount of repair work was done.

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.  
It can be safely stated today that the streets and roads of
Holyoke are in better condition than they have been for
some years.

Wood block paving was laid on High street, between
Appleton and Dwight streets, covering the space between
the curbing and the outer rail of each track of the street railway company; also on the east side of Main street, between
Spring street and Cabot street, and on Dwight street, between
Main street and the tracks of the Connecticut River Railroad
Company. Cabot street was paved with vitrified blocks between High street and Commercial street.

The long demanded change in Pleasant street, between
Hampden and Dwight streets, was brought about this year,
and the dangerous narrowness of the highway from Dwight
street northerly has been done away with; the street macad- amized and placed in good condition, from Dwight street to |
Lincoln, doing away with one of the worst stretches of street
that the city had.

No small amount of money has been expended in the
macadamizing of streets, prominent among which is the work
done on East street and Lyman street, in Ward One; on East
street in South Holyoke; South street, Suffolk street, Elm
street and Jackson street.

The outlying districts in many places have been provided
with sewers, at considerable expense, and many catch basins
have been constructed.

The sidewalks of the city have been thoroughly repaired *
and for considerable time during the summer the only work
done was the re-coating and placing in safe condition of worn
out sidewalks. More money has been expended during the
current season in the repair and maintenance of sidewalks

than during any year since the organization of the Board.

About seven thousand feet of eurbing has been
laid, of which three thousand has been four inch
curbing, this latter being placed on residential streets.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.

The appropriation for street watering was exded .by ,
nearly two thousand dollars ($ ), owing to the dry season
and the repairs that were made upon the sprinkling carts.

'The establishment of flat rate on metered water by
the Water Department has necessitated larger expenditure
in the department of water rent than during preceding years,

| and with the increased number of buildings and the increased
use of water the expenses in this department must be expected
to increase from year to year. |

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF ASSESSORS.  
VALUATION.

The valuation of the City of Holyoke, as of May ,
determined by the assessors July of that year, when the
rate of taxation was fixed, is as follows: :

Value of land oeee) 

Value of buildings re  

Total value of realestate . 
PERSONAL PROPERTY.

Value of personal property other than bank |

stock oe  
Value of shares of national banks, located

- in Holyoke, taxable in said city ..  

Total value of personal estate 
Total valuation of the city upon which taxes

were assessed for the financial year were  

The rate of taxation was made  per thousand of the
valuation of real and personal property, subject to taxation
under Chapter of the Revised Laws.

EXEMPTED PROPERTY.

Property exempt from taxation under Section  Chapter

 of the Revised Laws, is as follows:
United States oe  ) 
City of Holyoke oeee  
Houses of Religious Worship . 
Benevolent and Charitable Societies  
Literary Societies . 
Temperance Societies  
Soldiers and Sailors under Chapter  Sections

land  Actsof ..  

$ 

  REPORT OF THE BOARD OF ASSESSORS.

The valuation can be further increased  for
Bank Stock assessed at the several rates and places where the
banks are located, as the taxes are paid to Holyoke as assessments upon this class of property held by its citizens in Massachusetts banks located outside of Holyoke.

The valuation of personal property is further increased in
addition to the amount given in the foregoing table, by the
value assessed by the Commonwealth upon shares of Massachusetts corporations, including also proportionate part of
street railway tax, measured as per Section  Chapter  of

the Revised Laws, all of which is the property of residents of
the City of Holyoke, .

As the revenue from these two sources is always estimated
before the amount to be raised by taxation is determined, the
effect of valuation on this property in reducing the rate of taxation is really the same as though its amount was included in
the assessors’ valuation, and assessed by them.

The increase in valuation over is as follows:
Realestate  
Personal estate
