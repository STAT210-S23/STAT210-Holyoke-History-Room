 REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS

For several years now no new machine has been installed
in the day school, and this year an effort should be made to
complete the equipment of the Woodworking Shop. The
Printing and Pattern Making Shops, both of which are

,  erowded to their capacity, cannot be’ given new equipment
because they lack the floor space. |
With the easing off of conditions in the labor market it
seems likely that another year will see an increase of fifty:
per cent in the number of boys between the ages of and
  secking trade training, and steps should be taken immediately to cover this situation.

Renting quarters and remodeling old buildings have
proven in all cases where tried both unsatisfactory and uneconomical, and this brings us to the consideration of new building for housing this school and all its branches, including quarters for practical or home making arts for girls between the
ages of and  .

The best informed educational advisors are Jooking for- |
ward to an extension of Continuation School efferts, particu- |
larly along Vocational and Pre-Vocational lines, and Votational School planned wisely large way and correspondingly equipped ean always carry good part of this burden. 

. The State conducts in Springfield and other cities free
classes where tradesmen may learn the rudiments of teaching
and an appreciation of school ethies, thus fitting themselves
for positions as instructors. It is to be regretted that very
few Holyoke men have ever bothered to take these courses,
which is one of the reasons why it is usually necessary to look
outside of Holvoke for Vocational School instructors. In fairness to the men who give their time and effort to preparing
themselves for trade teaching it seems as though vacancies 
should when possible be filled from their number.

There is no way that we can more quickly ruin the
efficiency of school than by appointing as instructors men

REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS  
whose claim for consideration is based on anything whatsoever other than fitness and preparedness for the positions.

It is true that community has the privilege of selectIng its own teachers and that the State will under certain
conditions approve of such selection tentatively, but in the
event of man proving incapable the disagreeable duty of
removing him has to be faced, or if shirked until the State
registers its disapproval of the class or department as conducted, the community loses its reimbursement, the school
suffers loss in reputation and efficiency, and the pupils have
been simply defrauded.

: Attention is called to the charts showing enrolment, membership and attendance for the various years of the school’s
life, and to the fact that in the later years there is closer
relation shown between the enrolment and the other two lines.
Continuity of service by good teachers is one of the greatest
stabilizing factors we ean introduce in school, and it is
to be hoped that the recently adopted salary schedule will
make it possible for us to hold our teachers for longer terms
of service. |

In our Army hospitals began to receive in considerable numbers men, who had been injured or weakened by exposure or disease in the service. Copying the work done in
the continental hospitals of Europe they sought to busy these
patients as soon as convalescence started with employments
as nearly as possible of productive nature. |

It was but the taking of another step when the Government decided to voeationally retrain our injured men so as
to give them maximum of earning ability. Among the
reasons for this was the desire to maintain the pride and self- 
respect of the man by making him economically independent
and further to conserve so far as was humanly possible the
remaining man power of the world. |

I[olyoke was among the first places in the country to
respond to the call of the National Government, and we received our first student in February of  Since then we
have had total of rehabilitation men on our books at
different times, and have today the responsibility for  .

It is highly improbable that those who took the first steps
in this work locally gave any consideration to financial questions. There was job to be done which Holyoke in common
with the rest of this country was in duty bound to put across,
and the originators of the movement here were extremely
proud of their city to find her equipped to do the thing needed

| when the call came,

REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS  

Since then questions have arisen relating to the dollars
and cents side of this undertaking and the obligation of this
or any other city to take up work which is admittedly a

National obligation. Viewing it even as dollars and cents
proposition’ the fact remains that had all our Holyoke men,
who were unquestionably entitled to retraining, simply come
back to this city and entered our local schools, as they had a
perfect right to do, it would be costing the City of Holyoke
to train them much more than it does under the existing conditions. According to the best figures available there is a
total of approximately Holyoke men in training under ,
Government care. These men, beeause of the fact that their
Injuries, their needs, their ambitions and abilities all vary,
are being better cared for with the educational establishments
of the country to choose from than they would have been
] if limited to our local opportunities, good though these are.

The cities and towns where this work has been taken up
are all expending moneys which should be considered in the
nature of loans, which we have every reason to expect will be
returned at some not very distant date, and in the event that
no dollar:of it ever comes back, such cities and towns will have
merely redeemed the promises and pledges made repeatedly
by our leading citizens and officials as to what America would
do for her men when they came home.

Seldom has greater opportunity for service been offered
than this rehabilitation work now presents to the communities
and individuals willing to engage ip ‘+; and from the very
nature of the job, the more men know about it the greater their
enthusiasm and devotion. Go to any school where it is being
done and the men in charge will be found ready to make almost any personal sacrifice,, willing to assume almost any
responsibility to insure continuance of the effort now being made to put the incapacitated ex-soldier back on his feet as a
self-supporting citizen of the country in whose service he
suffered.

One of the very necessary features of Voeational Work
is covered in some other cities by the co-ordinator, as he is
ealled, man who has little or no responsibility for the con, duct or policies of the school, but whose province it is to
keep in close touch with the industries of the community
and harmonize the educational efforts of the school with the
business needs of the people to be served. It may well be
considered by this Board in the near future whether the
time has come for the employment of such an outside man
who might also take over to certain extent the duties of a
supervisor of Trade Extension Work.
Among the duties of such an official one of the most
important would be the definite organizing of classes to fill
training needs as discovered. Every vear voung snen come to

  REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS

us asking for courses for which we have not planned and
on the need of which we have no definite information. This
combined co-ordinator and extensiun supervisor would be
expected to go out among the younger journeymen and apprentices such lines of endeavor and within few days
be in position to state definitely whether there were individuals enough in the city needing that particular line of work
to make the organization of class justifiable. Such elass
should be started as soon as group sufficiently large could be
enrolled and teacher secured. The experience of several
years in this school has proved that delay in'the fulfillment of desire for improvement usually means that the
impulse languishes and dies. Year after year we have had
-more registrations for classes than we could accommodate, but
when later on vacancies occurred it was not an uncommon
thing to have to send notices to dozen on the waiting List

. in order to secure one entrant.

. The same tendency is noted in Trade Extension Work
that we have already spoken of in the Day School, to have
the attendance more regular throughout the term. This is
satisfactory as far as it goes, but there is noticeable falling
off in the number of people coming to us for assistance probably traceable to the fact that the amount of money spent on
advertising the classes has been during the last two years
considerably curtailed because of financial stringency. |

The Practical Arts Classes have shown decided swing
away from the evening to afternoon work with an improvement in the relations between enrolment and attendance. The
daylight classes being usually filled by women of more mature
years have the advantage of personnel whose purposes are
more definite and stable. This work is being pushed to the
limit of our available space, and another year it is to be hoped
can be even more extended.

school devoted to vocational training and thoroughly equipped .
for same, and for this reason feel the need of sending this

REPORT |
In December of the School Committee in obedience .
- to the vote of the City taken at the preceding State election
took the first step toward organizing the Continuation School .
by voting to vest the control of such organization in the hands
of the Board of Trustees for Vocational Education.
The Board of Trustees accepted the responsibility, placed
the preliminary arrangements in the hands of the Director
of the Vocational School, and later named Mr. J. F. Ganey
as Director of Continuation Work in the City of Holyoke.
Mr. Ganey took active charge of affairs June .
Teachers were selected for this work as nearly in accord with
the advice of the State Department as our conditions warranted. Men teachers were employed for boys, women teachers for girls, and in both groups consideration was given to
selecting such teachers as would make it possible, not only to
do regular class room work, but -:a reasonable amount of
manual arts as well.
After the organization of the school it was conducted
- for the remainder of the fiscal year by the Board of Trustees, the School Committee reassuming control December

Gentlemen: have the honor to present to you the
fifteenth annual report of the Department of Weights and
Measures of the City: of Holyoke, for the year ending

In presenting this report wish to recommend the following: |
First: The purchase of small auto truck for this department. This is recommended as matter of economy, as the automobile now in use by this department  so expensive for maintenance, it will be a
. great saving to the city to purchase new one.
Second: The work of this department has increased to such
proportions, that it has beeome imperative that the
office of Deputy Sealer be created. |

I wish to thank the eity officials, the manufacturers and

REPORT OF THE
Fire Commissioners
D mber .
‘To THE HONORABLE Mayor AND Board OF ALDERMEN:

Gentlemen: In accordance with the City Ordinance, we
submit to you the annual report of the Llolyoke Fire Department.

The year started with David Clark as the only
commissioner. John H. Dewey was appointed to the Board
December  th for the two-year term, and Joseph Doran was
appointed January  rd for the three-year term. On January

. oth, Commissioner Dewey resigned, and Dr. Matthew M.
Mahoney was appointed in his place. Commissioner Doran
, was replaced by Arthur E. French on January  th.

The Board met on January  th to organize. Arthur
EK. French was elected Chairman, and David Clark, VieeChairman.

The Commission takes great pleasure in making report
of one of the most sussful years in the history of the Department, although the number of fires exded that of
other years. The Department answered to alarms,  
more than last year.

The total fire loss for the year was 

| on buildings, and  on contents.  was
paid by insuranee companies, leaving net loss of an
average of  per fire. The average total loss per fire was
$ The gross loss per eapita was $.  and the net loss
per capita was $. summary of the reports of former .
years shows that we had the smallest total loss and the

|
  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS |
smallest loss per capita since  and the smallest average |
loss per fire in over twenty years. |
This is indeed record of which we can be proud. Much
praise  due Chief Hurley and the officers and men under |
him for the efficient and intellegent work done during the
year, especially during the month of February, when, during
the extremely bad weather, of the foree remained on
duty at all times. We also wish to show our appreciation to |
the public for their co-operation with the Department during |
the past year. Their promptness in sending in alarms of
fire before headway was gained accounts great deal
 toward making such successful year.
We have placed on the Roll of Honor Ist Deputy Chief
Daniel McLean, George Baker, and Aleide Viau for the
saving of lives at the fire at Race Street on April  th; |
and Captain Walter  S. Watt, Lieut. Thomas Conway, Lieutenant Roger P. Coffey, Francis Markey and Substitute
Dennis Lynch for meritorious conduct at the fire at Ely
Street on November  th.
The largest fires during the year were: at the Holyoke
City Hospital on January  th,  loss, at the |
building at High Street, owned by Anthony Symasko,
loss, at the J. W. Jolly Foundry on May  th, |
loss, .
We regret to report that Mrs. Mary MecHaffie of  
High Street, died on April as the result of her clothIng eatching fire. |
The Board initiated an ordinanee, which was favorably !
acted upon by the Board of Aldermen, prohibiting the parking of vehicles on the west side of Maple Street, from Hamp- |
den to Appleton Street; on the south side of Dwight’Street,
‘ from figh to Elm Street; and on the north side of Suffolk
Street, from Hlich to Elm Street. This ordinance has been
of much assistance to the Department, as we use these streets |
in responding to over of the alarms.
|
|
|

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS  

The Board voted during the early part of the year that

: survey of the Ilouse of Providence and City Hospitals be
made by the Department in regard to inereased protection
for the inmates in ease of fire. After careful examination
of these institutions, list of recommendations was prepared and sent to the hospital authorities, who have shown a
commendable desire to co-operate with the Department im .
safeguarding the lives of the inmates by the installation of ,
standpipes, sprinklers, ete. Jn this connection we wish to
show our appreciation for the valuable assistanee received
from the Board of Water Commissioners who installed the
service necessary for the sprinklers and standpipes.

The Board of Publie Works has greatly improved the
Mount Tom house and the Elmwood house by putting in
eonerete floors in these stations. This was wise and
necessary Improvement, owing to the dangerously weakened
eondition of the floors in these stations.

The Board of Fire Commissioners has granted substantial increase in wages to every member of the Department during the year. rule was added to the rules and
regulations of the Department that members shall not enter.
the employ of any person or firm during their time off duty,
without permission of the Board of Fire Commissioners.

Several improvements were made during the year. The
sizes of the tires on our motor apparatus have been standardized owing to the fact that some of the sizes formerly used
have been discontinued by the factories. We have also
purchased new fire bells for our three busiest pieces of apparatus to take the place of the sirens. These ean be heard
at greater distance than the sirens, and have worked to
good advantage.

The fire alarm boxes and several pieces of motor apparatus have been painted. Among the latter are the two
Knox motor hose wagons in South Holvoke, which have also
been completely overhauled and brought up-to-date by the :
installation of self-starters by the Supervisor of Automobiles.

; :
, |
 REPORT: OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS 
|
We would again call to the attention of the citizens of
‘ ITolyoke the matter of carelessness. It  fact that over
  of the fires are due to carelessness. While we have
heen fortunate this year in holding down our losses, it can
readily be seen that with the proper amount of thought and
| care, many lives and much valuable property can be saved
each year.
, We would like to eall your attention to our building
eode, which is inadequate and almost entirely lacking in fire
prevention requirements, and would suggest the adoption of
a code which would include the following important require- |
ments |
No frame construction should be allowed within the fire
limits. |
All receptacles for ashes should be of fireproof construction provided with metal clad doors and trim. —
All unprotected openings within twelve feet of an ad| joining building should be provided with standard metal
clad fire doors or metal frames and sash glass with wire glass. |
All stairease and elevator wells should be isolated and |
enclosed in fireproof shafts. |
We respectfully submit the following recommendations
for your approval: |
( We recommend the purchase of two hook and |
ladder trucks, one to be placed in Elmwood, and the other at |
the Highland Station. Since the Department has been work-  
ing under the two platoon system, it necessitates the use of :
four men as drivers. The salaries of these four men, together |
with the high eost of maintenance of the horses and repairs |
on the horse-drawn apparatus, eosts the Department in the |
neighborhood of ten thousand dollars year, whereas if this ,
were motor apparatus the men could be used as firemen. The
saving resulting thereby would pay for the two trucks that
we need in approximately two years.
|

- REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS  We recommend that the present wood floors at the
Tlighlands and South Holyoke Stations be replaced by conerete floors. There is at least one piece of motor driven apparatus in each of these stations, and there is an urgent need
for this improvement. |

( We reeommend that the stalls in the South IIolvoke, Elmwood and Highland Stations be removed and the
space’ utilized to better purpose.

( We recommend that sum of money be appropriated to purchase non-interfering fire alarm boxes to replace
the old Gardner boxes which have been in serviee for over
thirty years, and which are apt to become unreliable at any
time.

( We again recommend that the traffic rules be 
amended so that street ears shall stop on the near side of the
street. This regulation would prevent many of the accidents
that are hable to occur under the prevailing system.

 

We regret to report that we have lost three
men by death during the last year, viz:
. Edward J. Ahern, permanent fireman, who !
was appomted call fireman August  th,  ;
  and resigned in  was appointed to the
. Board of Engineers May  th,  was ap| pointed eall stoker August Sth,  and to the
permanent foree December and who
; died January  nd,  .
: John J. Donoghue, call stoker, who was ap| pointed on November  th,  and who died

‘ REPORT OF THE
Board of Park Commissioners
OF THE CITY OF HOLYOKE,
For the Year  .
To THE HONORABLE, THE Mayor AND BoaRD OF ALDERMEN
of the City of Holyoke:
Gentlemen: We beg to submit the annual report of the
Park Department for the year ending November .
This including statement of the receipts and expenditures
and distribution of the accounts; also our recommendations
for the coming year.
Owing to the generous appropriation given the Board it
has been able to make more headway during the past year
. than for many previous seasons; several improvements have
been made which are mentioned in the survey of the work
on the several parks following, the most important being the
re-laying of the walks and grass-plots and the construction
of cement walks at Hamilton Park.
, No new additions were made to the park area during
the year but the Board has under consideration the purchase
of additional land at Riverside and Elmwood Parks; early
in the year movement was started to take park land for a
- municipal athletic field and number of meetings were
held with organizations favoring the project; the Board
unanimously voted that it would oppose the taking of any
park land for the above purpose.

REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS  
The expenditures for the year were as follows:
Parks, Salaries ................... 
Parks, Maintenance ............... ,
Parks, Improvement .............. ,
————. 
Herewith we add survey of the work on the several
Parks with recommendations for your consideration. |
| HAMPDEN PARK
A start has been made this year to replace the loss of
the great number of trees on this park during recent years;
about fifteen trees of different varieties have been set out;
these were kindly donated by our Chairman, Mr. Simelair.
Several more must be planted the coming year as the loss of
the older trees still continues; the addition of new shrubs  s
also needed here. The general work on the park was looked
after in satisfactory manner.
PROSPECT PARK
In the early spring the old shelter house at the corner
of High and Prospect Street which was in poor condition
was renovated; new cement porch was built and the building painted; it was later opened up as men’s sanitary and —
a keeper installed. The walk bordering the park along
Prospect Street was re-surfaeed early in the year by the
Board of Public Works; this was greatly needed as it was
in dangerous condition. The ‘‘lookout’? on the parapet
wall opposite the entrance on Chestnut Street was repaired
by banking up granite paving bloeks which will tend to
prevent the washing away of the bank at this point. With
a few minor repairs to the walks and wall and the installing
of new drinking fountain this park will be in first class
eondition. The lawns and flowers on the park have been
well kept during the year.

  REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS
ELMWOOD PARK
| The work on this park was carried along satisfactorily |
for the number of men employed; on account of large area
a better showing could be made with additional help. The
eonstruction of the culvert in the Dingle has been completed
by the Board of Public Works and with the completion of
the fill to proper grade the improvement plan on the park at
. this point could be completed and would be greatly appreciated by the people in this locality owing to the unhealthy and unclean conditions arising from the dump at
this point. The tar walk on the Jackson Street side of the
park was re-surfaced by the Board of Public Works early in ,
the year. very successful skating season was enjoyed on
the rink operated by the Park Board on Bh Street. The
park is in need of more trees and the Board hopes to be able
to supply this need the coming year. ,
RIVERSIDE PARK |
. much needed improvement was done here in the construction of walk bordering the park on Main Street; the
shrubs were cut back sufficient to allow six foot walk which
at present is constructed of cinders; this should be changed
to cement the coming year. Considerable grading was done
and the roadway at the lower end of the park changed.
The park is used frequently for baseball and other sports
and on account of the large area requires much help to keep
it in proper condition. new horse-power mower was purchased and has given much satisfaction this year. The new
shelter for the children and matron at the wading pool was
opened; new curbing should be placed around the pool the
coming year. More grading must be done at the lower end
of the Park and more trees should be set out.

REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS  
CANONCHIET PARK

Only the usual routine work was done on this park. The
walks surrounding the park are in very poor condition ;
eement walks would add much to the appearance of the park.

" The drinking fountain on the park must be overhauled the
coming year.
HAMILTON PARK

The most important improvement on the parks in several
vears has been made at this park; the old plan of the walks
and grass-plots has been completely wiped out and new
plan which includes wider walks and larger plots has taken
its place. About yards of ten foot cement walks were
eonstructed and three large flower beds included. The park
is now in practically completed condition and adds great
deal to the service given by the park in this loeality. The
water of the drinking pump on Sargeant Street has been
analysed and found unfit for drinking purposes. This will
necessitate the placing of new fountain: on the park.

GERMANIA PARK ,

This park is in poor condition; the walks are narrow and
in bad shape and it is very difficult to keep the lawns looking
well. The Board has asked the City Engineer for rearrangement of the walks and plots somewhat similar to the
plan at Hamilton Park and if sufficient funds are available

expect to put the park im first class condition. The men’s
sanitary at the lower end of the park has been removed, it
having become nuisance. New trees are needed on the
park.
JONES PARK

About feet of trench was built to drain the swamp
located near the site of the old house, the swamp having beeome breeding place for mosquitoes and nuisance on the

  REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS
park. special appropriation would-be needed if start on
wny Improvements is to be made on this park.
FAIRFIELD AVENUE AND SMALLER PARKS
A keeper is kept on Fairfield Avenue Park during the
season and the Ranger and Sullivan Triangles were cared |
tor. Williston Park in Elmwood was looked after by the
men on Elmwood Park. The plot at the corner of North:mpton and Lineoln street was graded and seeded. The
Board would like to have the plots on the eorners of Northampton Street and Dwight Streets improved.
, RECOMMENDATIONS
In conclusion the Board would again ask your consideration of the recommendation contained in this report and for
the coming year would submit the following estimates :
For SalarieS .......  ccecc 
For Maintenance ........         
For Improvements ...........         
Kor the Purchase of Land ....................

REPORT OF THE

To THE HonoraBLeE, THE Mayor and Boarp OF ALDERMEN:

Gentlemen: present herewith the annue! statement of
the receipts and expenditures for the fiseal vear  in the
form and manner required by the State of Massachusetts.

I have audited the aceounts of the City Clerk, Milk
Inspector, Water, and Gas and Electric departments, found
them correct, the receipts properly recorded and promptly
deposited, and the expenditures approved in due form.

The Tax Collector’s books and entries have been audited .
as far as possible. The postings here number thousands, and
as each must be separately checked, it takes months to com-
plete the audit of his accounts. |

The report also contains detailed report of the expenditures in the Contingent Unclassified account, City In) debtedness, Tax Collector's exhibit, bonds issued during the

year, with the purpose for which they were issued, the cash
on hand, borrowing capacity, and comparative debt statement for the past years.

Bonds amounting to  were issued this year as )
follows: Highways, Sewers, .

Payments on the debt including Sinking Fund additions
totaled  as follows: City Debt, Gas
and Electric Debt, H. W. R. R. Debt, ;
Water Debt, .

REPORT OF
CHILD WELFARE DEPARTMENT
To THE HONORABLE, THE Mayor AND THE Boarp oF ALDERMEN OF THE City OF HoLyoKEe, MassaACHUSETTS.

Gentlemen: We beg to submit the seeond annual report
of the Child Welfare Commission.

The history of the establishment of the work of this de- |
partment has been fully presented to the city officials and
the public in the annual reports presented by the Infant
Hygiene Association from to and the first annual

report of this department which dated from its creation
December .

If city’s progressiveness is indicated by the interest
shown in conserving the health of its children, then Holyoke
may well stand in the front rank. 

Mayor John J. White will always stand out as the first

- mayor who listened to the appeal for all the children of
TIolyoke.

No mayor or board of aldermen in the years following
has turned deaf ear to the appea! even though they have
not always found it possible to meet the needs of continually growing enterprise.

The leaders of the work have always had before them
the vision of ever widening service to the city.

There are the poor little children of the well-to-do and
the rich little ones of the poor, if they be breast fed and are
strong and healthy; then there are all the grades between

  REPORT OF THE CHILD WELFARE DEPARTMENT

the two that for innumerable causes come under the care
of this department as far as proper food and instruction to
the mother in general care and home-making can help to
bring about right conditions for the child.

The department is’ affiliated with the American Child
Hygiene Association. Its statistical reports are submitted
annually to this organization and to the chief of the
Children’s Bureau at Washineton and the Hygiene Department of the State Board of Health.

The Commission was represented by the chairman at the

International Conference of Women Physicians and Lay
Workers of the Women’s Health Foundation which was held
in New York. Dr. E. P. Bagg, Jr., secretary, was the
“delegate attending the Eleventh Annual Meeting of the
American Child Hygiene Association held in St. Louis in
November. |

ACTIVITIES.
INFANT CarE:—Consists of furnishing modified and whole
| milk of high grade with special formulae for sick and
malnutrition cases. Visits to the homes by the trained
nurse for supervision of the eare of babies and the
teaching of mothers. Weekly clinics where babies are
weighed and examined and mothers advised or en| couraged.

The saving of lives and health of babies was the 
first step of the work in this field. Holyoke’s infant
mortality rate was high. This work was direct and its
results eould be more econeretely realized in the form of
actual statistics. This was shown continuously,’ but
especially after ten years when the city’s infant death
rate has fallen from one hundred and fifty of
each one thousand births in  (exclusive of
Brightside) to ninety-four in  This has been
with an inerease of one-sixth in our population in
the same time. The English statistician, Newsholme,

REPORT OF THE CHILD WELFARE DEPARTMENT |
has said that only ten years’ statistics are valuable since
death rates of comparative years are too frequently affected by epidemies and weather conditions.

The nurses are chosen, not alone for their traimuing,

‘ but for their interest in the special field and the willingness of self-sacrifice which it demands. We cannot say
too much in commendation of the devotion and faithfulness to the business interests as well as the welfare
work of Miss Luella Thomson, Supervising Nurse and
Miss Amy Gould, Station Nurse.

The Baby Clinic is open every Thursday at P. M.

with Dr. F. H. Allen and Dr. E. P. Bagg, Jr., im attendanee.

PRENATAL CareE:—Instruction to expectant mothers in
personal hygiene, preparation for the birth of the child,
securing medical, maternity or hospital care where
necessary and teaching American customs to the foreign ;
mothers the eare of their homes and children.

. The esare of mothers before the birth of their |
children was the next step we had long been preparing ;
for. Since it was soon found that premature births,
still births and maternal deaths were unaffected and we
could hope to do little more toward reducing our actual
mortality records until prenatal and obstetrical work
could be properly undertaken, it was with great satisfaction to the Commission that the appointment of
Mrs. Ella Perkins. first prenatal nurse, was made April

} .

That her ministrations have been welcome and |
necessary to the mothers is shown by her report, but the
varied nature of her duties, prompted often by her ap  REPORT OF THE CHILD WELFARE DEPARTMENT
preciation of the peculiar need of the case, cannot be
reported.

: With the development of clinic for mothers, with
an obstetrical or maternity nurse, the work of conserving Holyoke’s share of the women who die

annually in the United States from sources due to childbirth will be in great measure effected.

Co-operation with the Red Cross Maternity Nurse is

| at present bringing good results. The United States has
a higher maternal death rate than any other of the
principal countries except Spain and Switzerland, according to the records of the Children’s Bureau. We  .,
learn also from the same source that in more
children died from conditions related to the care. of the
mothers than from bad care, bad feeding, or infectious

) diseases. Can we ask if we can afford to extend this
most important branch of our work?

PRE-SCHOOL AGE AND NUTRITION CLINIC:—Weighing and
examination of children under school age; advice to

mothers and visiting nurse; finding proper care for
needy or neglected cases of sub-normal children. .

: The pre-school age chnie which has been opened
during the past year is developing and many interesting eases have come to the attention of the physicians
and received proper care or direction.

Dr. J. B. Bigelow, Dr.  S. C. Cox, Dr. D. I. Beaupre
and Dr. Arthur L. Kinne have given their services during the past year to examining children who have attended these clinies, which are open every Thursday at
  P. M. at the Milk Station.

t

REPORT OF THE CHILD WELFARE DEPARTMENT  
EXTENSION NEEDS.

It is with gratification that we find at the-close of the
year that two of our aspirations or needs of last year’s report have become realizations—a full time prenatal nurse
and the opening of the pre-school age clinic at the Milk
Station.

Still we come, however, with the same ery of need for ,
new building in which to do the work of feeding each day |
some two hundred children. Plans for structure which
should for years to come prove adequate for housing all
work having direct bearing on child welfare from the
health standpoint, are quite definitely formulated in the
minds of those who have seen the needs develop to the point 
where curtailment of service to the public will be imperative unless more ecommodious quarters and better
equipment are provided at the earliest possible date. It
now looks impossible to carry on another summer’s work in
the present location.

THE MILK SUPPLY AND SUPERVISION.

The milk supply is under the supervision of the Massachusetts Agricultural College, Dairy Department. The
inspection includes not alone the farms from which the milk
is produced, but the local dairy and the Milk Station where
the milk is handled in modification and distribution.
Periodic analysis of milk samples are made by these agents
and in addition to this during the coming year, semimonthly analysis of the bacterial content of the milk at the
Station will be made and reported by our medical director.

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER
BRIDGES

The most important municipal problem which must be
solved in the near future is the strengthening or replacement of our many bridges to bring them up to present day
requirements and to provide for future reasonable needs.
In many places throughout the West bridges are being
built to care for twenty-four ton automobile trucks. Massachusetts has established through its State Departments |
minimum loadings of twenty tons. Few bridges in the City
are up to this latter standard. The bridge is the controlling
element in the construction of highways. Improvement in
our highways tending to attract heavier traffic necessitates

, the construction of bridges to meet conditions.

The intensive travel which has developed in recent
vears on all our bridges demands substantial flooring. At 
present day prices of lumber wooden floors have become
very expensive. The life of wooden floor at best is but |
three or four years. In many cases where the traffie is congested, as on the County Bridges, wooden flooring lasts but
one year,

In the past few months an overloaded truck of trap
rock went through the plank floor of the Willimansett

| Bridge. Luckily for the driver, however, one of the steel
floor girders prevented the truck from falling into the river.
examination of the steel trusses and floor system of the
South Hadley Falls County Bridge was made by Major
Moore of the Pubhe Utilities Commission and on his advice
reinforced concrete is now being considered as permanent
pavement. The steel members are generally in good condition, Necessary minor repairs are now being made to prepare for the permanent floor.

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER 
PAVEMENTS

The extensive paving programme proposed for the year
  has been earried to completion. With few exceptions
the main arteries of travel through the City have pavements adapted to the kind of traffie for which they are used.
Much of the congestion on Main Street between Dwight and
Sargeant Streets has been relieved by diverting traffie to 
Race Strect.

Sinee the installation of the new pavement Pleasant
Street has again become the most popular street in the Highlands.

: Paving St. Jerome Avenue has afforded the Oakdale
section of the City ample fire protection by providing the
most direct means of ass for the Highlands Fire Apparatus.

Dwight Street from Appleton to Ivy Avenue was paved
with concrete, thus makine continuous permanent pavement from the center of the City to Northampton Street.

The City as whole probably derived greatest benefit

 from development of the main thoroughfares leading to and
from neighboring cities. Great progress has been made by
Daniel O’Connell’s Sons in preparing the foundations for
the new Easthampton Road which is being built wnder the
direction of the State Ilghway Commission. |

The use of conerete for permanent paving is becoming
general throughout the country. The vardage of concrete
laid in the United States in was almost sixty times as
great as in  .

Closing the street to traffic after construction to give
eonerete time to harden sufficiently is the one unavoidable
inconvenience of conerete pavement.

Northampton Street from Whiting's Hill to Brightside
is one of the streets which will claim attention in the near
future. comparatively small expenditure will be required
to eliminate some of the curves and ease off the steep grades,

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER

one near Ferry Street and another near the Underpass. I

would suggest that the asphalt top on the lower Springfield

Road be removed and replaced with conerete pavement
| similar to the half mile laid in  .

There seems to be demand for improvement of the
paving on Appleton Street from Main Street to the new
bridge over the First Level Canal and from Front Street to

' High Street. :

Some suggestions have been made for relaying the
eranite blocks on Race Street between Mosher and Dwight
Streets, thereby completing the stretch of road from S.rgeant Street to the County Bridge. Oe .

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER :
) SEWERS

Completion of Elmwood Park culvert by building a
conerete section feet Jong was one of the accomplishments of the year  The culvert is now continuous
from the Connecticut River to Linden Street, extending to
Race Street in Berkshire Street, thenee through the Germama and Farr Alpaca Companies’ properties under the
Ilolyoke and Westfield Railroad and in Elmwood Park to a
point nearly opposite Linden Street.

When it is considered that nearly two and one-half
miles of sewers were laid this year it will be seen that the
amount of sewer work accomplished is probably the largest
In any one Vear in the history of the City. main sewer
was built from the westerly end of the Elmwood Park
eondiuit to drain the low points in Elmwood between Congress Avenue and Davis Street. The sewer system accommodating the Fidelity Land Company's property known as
Maple Terrace,  nearing completion and all the sewers im
the Elmhurst Tract have been in commission for some

, months.

THE HonoraBe, THE Mayor AND MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF
ALDERMEN OF THE City oF HOLYOKE, MASSACHUSETTS.
Gentlemen: The report of the Department of Public
Works for the year ending November is appended.
Notwithstanding the difficulties encountered im procuring materials and supplies, shortage of labor and almost
prohibitive ear supply early in the summer, goodly showing has been made in the work aceomphshed and many needed
and long required improvements have been made.
The total expenditures for new construction aud maintenance from the reeular appropriation amount. to
Seven Hundred Forty-Five Thousand Five Hundred Thirteen
, Dollars and eighty-four cents ($ and bills were
paid from special appropriations necessitated by liabilities
contracted in  amounting to Sixty-Seven Thousand
One Hundred Ninety-Six Dollars and fifty-two cents ($ ), making total cost of maintenance and construction !
as paid in of Eight Hundred Twelve Thousand Seven |
Hundred Ten Dollars and thirty-six eents ($ ).
A balance was brought forward from to  amounting to Thirtv-Two Thousand Three Hundred Forty-Two
Dollars and thirty cents ($ ). Appropriations were
made from loans for Permanent Highways in the amount of
Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($ and for Sewers,
Ninety Thousand Dollars ($ ), total of Two Hundred
Ninety Thousand Dollars ($ ). Original appropriREPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
ations were made from taxation amounting to Five Hundred
Eleven Thousand Five Hundred Fifty Dollars and sixty-nine
cents ($ ). Additional appropriations, either by
transfer or supplementary appropriations were made amounting to Thirty-Eight Thousand Three [Tundred) Ninety-Seve ,.
Dollars and twenty-eight cents ($ ), while service
transfers were made to the departments, amounting to Twelve
Thousand Seven Tundred One Dollars and thirty-eight eents
(# ). The ipts of all departments total TwentySix Thousand Three Hundred Twenty-Two Dollars and
fifty-eight cents ($ ), making total credit to the
departments from all sources for the year  of Nine
Hundred Eleven Thousand Three Hundred Fourteen Dollars
and twenty-three cents ($ ). The department has
transferred from various departments Twenty-Three Thousand Four Hundred Eighty-One Dollars and sixty-one eents
($ and has earried forward in balances to the
year  Seventy-Five Thousand One Hundred Twenty- |
Two Dollars and twenty-six cents ($ ).

We believe that the citizens in general appreciate the
efforts that have been made by this Board in the aceomplish' ment of much needed improvements, an itemized list of
which will be found in the exlnbits of the various departments, as hereinafter contained.

The most important work, aside from the permanent
street work, has been the construetion of new sewer system
in the Fidelity tract and in the Elmhurst tract, so-called ;
the extension and completion of the culvert in) Elmwood
Park between Maple Street and Bh Street, this now
forming complete closed sewer system from the Connecticut River to Bh Street at Franklin Street, sufficient
in capacity to eare for all anticipated needs of the City for
all time to come, unless unforseen and unanticipated events
give Holyoke phenomenal growth.

 

|
 REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
A sewer has also been provided in the Elmwood Park |
from the Bh Street culvert to Chapin Street, which will |
eare for any growth of the Elmwood section north of Carlton
Street and east of Chapin Street. These systems have not
been entirely completed but have required an expenditure
in of Eightv-Five Thousand Three Hundred Ninety-  
Eight Dollars and fifty-eight cents ($ and will |
provide sewer accommodations for all of the section north !
of Cherry Street and east of Tlillside Avenue to Woods
Avenue. It is expected that the system will be ready for |
use early in January of the coming year.
The sum of One Hundred Forty-Eight Thousand One |
Hundred Ninety-Nine Dollars and fifty-nine cents ($ has been expended in the Permanent TWiehways
department in new pavements constructed on Appleton
Street from Canal Street. westerly to the Boston Maine
railroad braneh traek, Bridge Street between Lyman and
 Ely Streets, Dwight Street between Appleton Street and
Ivy Avenue, Hampden Street from Brooks Avenue to
, Lincoln Street, Titechcock Street between the ear traeks on
Northampton Street to Hillside Avenue, Lyman Street from
Maple Street to Chestnut Street, Main Street beween Dwight
and Mosher Streets, Pleasant Street between Dwight Street
and Lineoln Street, Race Street from Appleton Street to
Sargeant Street, Sargeant Street from Main Street to Canal
Street, the Springfield Road from Day Avenue short distance northerly, and St. Jerome Avenue, between Dwight
Street and Franklin Street, demands for paving on these
streets having been made for number of years.
, No attempt was made this yvear for work in the Permanent Sidewalk Department, the work on sidewalks being
chiefly confined to repair and maintenanee of existing walks
and while all of the walks in need of attention could not be
eared for, it is hoped by the close of the coming year that
the genera] repair work will be completed for time.

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS 
A start was made last summer towards the placing of a
permanent roadway on the South Hadley Falls bridge,
Thirty-Five Thousand Dollars ($ being set aside in
the Permanent Highway Department for this purpose. The
bridge was examined by an expert engineer engaged by the
Board who reported it in very good condition and of sufficient
strength to carry conerete floor system and later an
examination was made by Lewis E. Moore, Bridge and
Signal Engineer of the Public Utilities Department which
eorroborated the report of the City’s Engineer. Owing to
the lateness of the season at which the report was received
it was not deemed wise to prosecute the work this year, but
it is hoped to begin early in to place the new permanent
floor system on this bridge, The iron work of the bridge is
now being repaired and such work as is necessary for
strengthening and plaeing the strueture in thoroughly
satisfactory condition will be completed before spring.
The Willimansett Bridge is also being examined and it
is very probable that considerable amount of work will be
necessary on this structure to make the same safe for carrying
its present loads. If any work is to be done in strengthenme
the bridge, modern floor system and roadway should be
installed at the same time.
While Holyoke is looking at its two bridges crossing the
, Connecticut River, it should not lose sight of the many
bridges crossing the canals, attention to which has been
called from time to time by this department.
It is hoped that the time is at hand when Holyoke will
. meet. the issue of the replacement of its canal bridges
squarely and provide sufficient funds for the replacement of
these bridges. The bridges are not only antiquated for
present loads but dangerous and unsafe for the traffie that
they are daily sustaining. It is true we have had no serious
accidents. We sincerely trust that we will have none, but
, there is no official or engineer who can guarantee that such

|
— REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
an accident will not oecur at almost any time under the |
loadings that these bridges daily maintain. It is only by !
. the grace of Divine Providence that Holyoke has escaped a
. disaster, and this is no hysterical statement. Words fail to
express the situation as felt by the Board. In our opinion |
the preferable way is to provide sufficient loan for the replacing of the antiquated bridges at once even if it may be !
necessary to ask the Legislature to go outside the debt limit |
to secure funds. Eventually Holyoke must, by loan, provide |
for the replacement of these bridges and there is very iittle |
to recommend (aside from the lessened immediate financial :
obligations) the borrowing of small amounts each vear for ,
their replacement. We believe that the citizens of Holyoke
should realize the necessity of providing safe and adequate
structures and if they fully comprehend the condition of the
present structures there will be no hesitancy on their part
In agreeing to any reasonable proposition for making the
structures safe.
Aside from the First Level Canal Bridge on Dwight
Street and the First Level Canal Bridge on Appleton Street,
all of our canal bridges are in need of replacement or
material repairs. The Board feels the matter cannot be too
strongly placed before you, but of course if sufficient funds
are not provided the Board cannot maintain either safe or
adequate structures. It also feels that if appropriations for |
this work are yearly denied, that the Department should not |
be expected or required to assume responsibilities of accidents
that may occur.
A permanent form of pavement should be laid on
Northampton Street from the end of the present concrete
pavement to the State Highway near Kenilworth. Also a
permanent roadway should be eonstrueted on Cherry Street
from Northampton Street to the Sanatorium. Also that the
several culverts under the Springfield Road should be reconstructed this year, and the lower road from the end of

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
the present concrete pavement to the West Springfield line
reconstructed either by the laying of new asphaltic wearmg
surface or concrete roadway. The pavement on Northampton Street from Whiting Hill, so-called, to the Springfield
Road should be extended and the grades eliminated to such
extent as may be permissible. It will be well to reconstruct
or repair the paving on Main Street from Dwight Street
southerly and it is hoped that something can be done on
Appleton Street from High Street to Winter Street and the
pavement relaid on Race Street between Canal Street and
Dwight Street. The repairs on High Street north of Lyman
Street and south of Cabot Street should be given attention
and Cabot Street between Race Street and Canal Street,
Summer Street between Cabot and Adams Streets, Park and
Crescent Street between Appleton and Canal Streets and
Bridge Street between Cabot and Sargeant Streets should
also be given attention. The paving on Lyman Street between Canal and Center Streets should be reconstructed and
new roadway provided. The surface of this street is not in
good condition and ean only be made satisfactory by replacement.

Improvements should be made in the road from Northampton Street to and through Ashley Ponds. It is of the
opinion that the Water Department should join with the
Board in the improvement of the road at the ponds. This

road leading to West Holyoke should be relocated from a

point near Homestead Avenue or Bray’s Pond, so-called, to

the top of the Rock Valley Road hill and should follow a
course considerably west of the prgsent road from the ponds.

The Board believes that the City should make an effort

the coming year to have the State Department of Public
Works continue the improvement of the Easthampton Road

from its present terminus about one mile east of the Easthampton line to Northampton Street and if this work will

| not be undertaken by the State Department without direct

|
|

O  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS

act by the Legislature, action should be taken by the City |

for the passage of law directing the commission to construct ,

this road. In connection with this matter careful study

should be made of the proposed new layout of the road into |

Northampton Street whereby the heavy grade on the present |

Easthampton Road layout ean be eliminated. .

Somewhat more work was done in the past year in the

Forestry Department than has been done for several years.

The Board believes that the existing trees should be carefully

cuarded and preserved. It does not appear to be wise

pohey to plant trees and allow them to grow to mature age

and then remove them or allow them to go to decay if it  s

possible by care to preserve them. start should be made

in the planting of shade or ornamental trees in the streets

of our city and that the grass plots and tree belts between

the eurbing and sidewalks should be maintained in thoroughly satisfactory and pleasing condition. We are of the

opinion that the belts should be sodded or grassed and the

grass maintained. This could be done with little effort

and cooperation on the part of the citizens and abutters.

It might be said that the grass on the lawns around the City

Hall could be made beauty spot in the center of our city

by very little cooperation on the part of the people who use ‘

the streets during parades, it frequently occurring that the

lawn  overrun and the grass trampled, thereby obliterating

the entire efforts of season in very short space of time.

We believe that the tree belt areas on both sides of Maple

Street between Dwight and Appleton Streets should be

eliminated and the space gn the sidewalk thus occupied given

to the roadway as the street is much congested at the present

thine.

We believe that direction signs should be erected and

maintained rendering much service to the traveler to and |

throughout city. There should also be many additional no

parking warning signs and standards erected in restricted

areas. New apparatus should be purchased, consisting of a
steam shovel, portable stone crusher, new flusher for the
Street Watering Department, at least one truck for the Alley
Department, catch basin cleaning apparatus and two hght
delivery trucks, one for use in the Outdoor Department and
one for use In the Forestry Department. We would suggest
that if appropriations are to be made for either the purchase
of equipment. or for the doing of permanent work that they
he passed early in the year so that contracts ean be made
and the work started at the most advantageous time. It was
impossible during the current year to obtain materials or
supplies early in the season so that work was necessarily
thrown over to the close of the year.

The Board is now negotiating for the purchase of additional machinery and equipment to be used in the Highway
Department with which it  hoped that our eountry roads
ean be brought to satisfactory condition. considerable

 amount of work has been done on theni during the eurrent
vear especially on the road Jeading to Hampton Ponds.
There is yet much work needed in the West Holvoke seetion
and the road leading to Southampton. With the purchase
of portable stone crusher it is thought that these roads
ean be improved without excessive eost.

A recapitulation sheet of the cost of maintaining and
completing buildings during the past year together with the
expense brought over from the special over-drafts of  ,
shows an expenditure in public buildings of One Hundred
Eighty One Thousand Four Hundred Forty-Three Dollars and
sixty-nine cents ($ ). from which the sum of Eighty
Two Thousand Seventy Eight Dollars and eighty-three cents
($ was expended for the care and maintenance of
school buildings. It would not appear from these figures
that the school buildings were being slighted inasmuch as
only Seventeen Thousand Dollars ($ has been spent
upon the Fire Department buildings and Seventy QOne

|
  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
Thousand Eight Hundred Twenty Six Dollars ($ )
upon all other buildings while all other expenses entering |
into the buidings were Ten Thousand Three Hundred |
Ninety Two Dollars ($ ). There is no question but
what much should be done to improve the condition of all
of our buildings. There is much needed work but it does
not appear that the sehool buildings have suffered vastly
more than other structures of the city. It  simply question of funds or appropriations and if this Board is granted
the appropriations it  only too glad to make such repairs
as in its opinion are mostly required. It is hoped that
during the coming vear the work of improving all of our
buildings ean be continued and we shall be only too pleased
to be afforded at any time an opportunity to place before
you the full requirements of the Department. It is not to be
expected that with the rapid growth and increase in build- |
ings that all can be placed in the condition desired at once |
but the Board believes in the main satisfactory evidences of
improvements are being shown. Improvements should be
made upon the City Hall building as well as the other build- |
ings and we believe that this building being the center of
the municipal interest should be well maintained. It has |
been negleeted without question and something showd be |
done to improve its condition during the coming year, :
careful study of the needs of all of the buildings is being
made and such repairs as the Board can make with the funds
available will be made, the most urgent requirements being
first met. |
The Ward One Bath House at the East Dwight Street
 School is still incomplete and the Board has been unable to
properly operate the same satisfactorily during the past
summer. An investment represented by this building should
not be allowed to he in dormant state and the citizens of |
this section of the eity should be granted the opportunity |
of availing themselves of the benefits that this structure
|

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
wil furnish. An addition on the east side of this bath house
should be constructed for shower baths and locker rooms, the
present arrangement being entirely inadequate to care for
the bathers who will use the building. It is beheved that
an appropriation for the construction of this addition and
the maintenanee of the bath house during the current year
of Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($ will be required.

The buildings at the City Yard should be enlarged and
land purchased for this purpose. The erection of garage
for the storage and repair of all city machines upon land
adjacent to the City Yard property can well be considered.

The heating apparatus in both the Elm Street and Elmwood Sehool buildings should be thoroughly overhauled
during the coming year. New boilers should be installed in
the Elm Street School and additional new boilers provided
for the Elmwood School. While the boilers in the South
Chestnut Street Sehool are in serious need of replacement
it is doubtful if the City would be justified in expending a
considerable amount of money on this work owing to the
probability of Central Grammar School building being
erected in the near future. For this reason it is believed
that little money should be expended upon either the
Lawrence School or the South Chestnut Street School buildings.

During the past year contract -was made for the installation of new sanitaries in the Park Street Schoo] buildIng but owing to the difficulties encountered the work was not
started. It is expected that this will be done early in  .

In the School buildings it is planned, if sufficient appropriations can be had to wire for electric lighting all of
the buildings which are now unequipped. There is constantly growing need of lighting in the school rooms during |
the school sessions and this will fill desire long expressed
by the School Department.

|
  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
, Many of the roofs of school buildings have been thoroughly repaired at considerable expense where in past
years only patching was done, necessitating fresh expenditures upon them each year.
Steps have been taken to provide new school building
for Smiths Ferry and plans are now being prepared for a
modern structure with community hall, the estimated cost
of the same being Thirty Thousand Dollars ($ ).
New concrete floors have been installed in both the Mt.
Tom and Elmwood Engine Houses and improvements made
in the sanitary arrangements at the Mt. Tom house. The
old stables have been removed owing to the motorizing of
the Fire Department and the space given over to the use of
the house proper. During the coming year it is hoped that
: concrete floors ean be installed in the Relief Engine House
and the Highland Engine House, the work being badly
needed,
At the Central Fire Station it was necessary to re-pipe
voth the hot and cold water systems, owing to the pipes
rusting, this being an expeusive proposition owing to the
fact that the pipes had originally been installed in the conerete floors.
At the City Farm repairs are under way upon the heatIng system and much work should be done during the coming
year upon the building. The interior of the building is in
need of renovation. During the past year new refrigerating plant was installed which has greatly increased the
efficiency in that building. |
The cost to the City for the removal of its rubbish and |
ashes  mounting continually and the Board will make ,
eareful survey of this department early the coming year. |
It hopes to start plan of motorizing the division with the ,
idea of lessening the cost of removal and furnishing better
service. The cost of removing ashes during was approximately Seventy Thousand Dollars ($ ); the cost

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
of removing garbage was approximately Ten Thousand One
Hundred Dollars ($ ). The garbage contracts are now
upon three-year basis and the efficiency in the garbage
department has been in most eases increased during the
vear. It is hoped that an improvement ean also be shown
during the coming two years the contracts have yet to run.

The culvert parallel with Bh Street in the Elmwood
Park ravine should be extended westerly to provide additional dumping space for the Alley Department. Attention

* should be given to the necessity of providing future dumping
erounds for the Alley Department, the Board having in
previous years called attention to this matter.

The Board believes that where Fire Insurance is placed
upon any of our publie buildings that the policies should be
written for term of three or five years and that sufficient
funds should be provided this coming year to inaugurate this
policy. In writing the policies for three years premium
equal to one-half year is saved. The practice in the past
has been to write policies for one year only.

The Board recommends that the Hillside Hospital
property from which wood was cut in be sold. The
property has been vacated by the Health Department and ,
it does not appear that the City has use for the property at
the present time. We also recommend that the lot adjacent
to the Highland Engine House be sold as it does not appear
that this property will be needed for City uses.

The sidewalk on Northampton Street should be extended
as far north as Kenilworth and with the building of the new
school in Smiths Ferry sidewalks along Northampton Street
in this section must be installed.

There is need of some extension of street lighting in
various parts of the City, especially in West Holyoke, Ingleo  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
side and along the Northampton Road as far as Smiths
 Ferry, also in the newly laid out streets. Much work of this
nature was delaved during the wartime period.
