ANNUAL REPORT OF THE
i] i]
Board of Park Commissioners
OF THE CITY OF HOLYOKE
For the Year Ending November 
To the Honorable the Mayor and Board of Aldermen of the
City of Holyoke:

GENTLEMEN: We submit herewith the Annual Report of
the Board of Park Commissioners for the year ending November Also distribution of the expenditures and
recommendations for the coming year.

The work on the parks was confined almost entirely to
maintenance, very litle progress being made on improvement,

. as no appropriation was at hand except transfer of
$  for the Bh Street Playfield. few minor improvements were made which are mentioned in the review of
the several parks following.

The total expenditures for maintenance and improvements were and for land, the amount of .

We append herewith brief review of the work during
the year and also recommendations for the coming season.

HAMPDEN PARK.

This park has been kept up well during the season, several flower beds are maintained and the lawns have been
well cared for. Some of the older trees here have become deeayed and several have been removed the past few years, especially on the Maple street side where the street has been
widened new trees should be set out to take the place of those
removed, and to provide against future removals. sanitary for women and children would be of great advantage

  REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS
on the park. The walks and tree belts should receive some
attention soon.

PROSPECT PARK.

The improvements started on this park have not been
completed, and an appropriation should be made to do so, as
the present conditions are drawback to the enjoyment of the
park and also dangerous. The new lights should be installed

on the parapet wall and the grading and seeding of the grass
plots completed in the spring and flower beds added. The
walk bordering on Prospect street should be replaced and extended from Elm street to the ice house, and new drinking
fountain erected. The new shelter for women and children
was opened in the spring and concrete retaining wall was
built by the Ice Company and the city, which add much to
the appearance of this end of the park. This park is visited
by people from all parts of the city as well as strangers, and
the above improvements should be completed as soon as possible.

ELMWOOD PARK.
, Has received the usual good care and attention during
the year and is greatly appreciated by the people of this localitv. The improvements on this park have been at standstill for few years past, and the Board would like an appropriation to resume improvements, and especially to start
the bridge at Pine street. The playfield at Bh street has
been extended and graded, and with little more grading in
the spring will make one of the finest in the city. The skating rink at this point will also be extended this winter. A
shelter for women and children would be very convenient here
and new drinking fountain should be provided.
RIVERSIDE PARK.

The Board has set out about two hundred trees here in
the spring. The wire fence along Main street has been extended and the Board is glad to report that no accidents have

REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS  
occurred at this point this year. The wading pool continues
to be popular with the children, and the ball fields are used
extensively by the older boys and young men. The rose garden started here has been very successful and should be enlarged. Better shelter facilities should be provided here.
Some rough grading was done during the year and the grass
and shrubs kept up in good condition.

JONES PARK.

| valuable addition to the park has been acquired this
year by the purchase of plot of land on Pleasant street which
will provide when developed suitable entrance from this
street. All-the chestnut trees here were affected with the
chestnut tree blight and were cut down; the Board would like
to replace the above trees with trees of different variety
the coming spring, and also start development work. The
Board would also like to install an old-fashioned flower garden here, and suitable plan made for the same, as the loeation here would be ideal, and the garden would make valuable attraction.

SMALLER PARKS.

Hamilton, Germania and Canonehet Parks have received
excellent attention and are source of comfort to the people
of their vicinity during the summer months. Flower beds
are maintained and the grass and shubbery well cared for.
Fairfield Avenue Parkway, Laurel Park and the Sullivan and
Ranger Triangles have been looked after during the vear.

IN CONCLUSION.

The Board would respectfully call your attention to the
great possibilities for development in the Park System of our
city and to the suggestions and recommendations herein contained, and would ask you for the coming year the following

REPORT OF THE
FIRE COMMISSIONERS —
Office of Fire Commissioners,
Holyoke, Mass., December .
To THE HONORABLE Mayor AND ALDERMEN.

GENTLEMEN: We respectfully submit to you the report
of the Fire Department for the year ending December  ,
 ,

The Board of Fire Commissioners consisting of Sidney
EK. Whiting, James H. O’Connell and Charles U. Roy met
January and organized by the election of Sidney E.
Whiting, as Chairman, James H. O’Connell, as Vice-Chairman, and John Hildreth, as Secretary.

On March the Mayor appointed Robert E. Newcomb to sucd Sidney E. Whiting, and on March ,
Robert E. Newcomb was elected Chairman of the Commission.

There have been four hundred and thirty-nine fires and
alarms during the past year. This is thirty-eight less than
last year, and the reason for the large decrease is, we believe,
the wet weather in the spring, when we usually have so many
brush fires. The losses on the buildings amounted to and the losses on the contents amounted to ,
giving as the total fire loss the sum of The property endangered by fire amounted to and the
insurance on said property amounted to The
insurance companies paid the sum of leaving a
net loss on the four hundred and thirty-nine fires and alarms
of or an average loss on each alarm and fire of .

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS  

The above report does not contain the losses un three
small fires, viz:—Maxwell Simmons in February, Henry
Monat in October, and George Harscheid in November, and
the large fire in the Empire Theater in April, as these losses
have not been adjusted, and so could not be included in the
report.

Outside of the Empire Theater fire, there was no very
large fires. The most serious were the E. H. Friedrich fire
and the Holyoke Bakery Company fire, and these losses were
respectively,  and .

Your Commissioners appreciate very much the splendid
work of the Department and congratulate the officers and
men on their fine year’s work.

We deeply feel the loss the Department has sustained in

 the death of our beloved Chief Lynch, who for thirty years
so wisely guided the Department. He died April ,
and William P. Brady, after fifteen years of service died October .

Two persons have lost their life by fire in this city during
the year, viz:—Choedor Shkabara from burning gasoline in
May and Clifford Fitzgerald in July from playing with
matches.

Last year we drew attention to the fact that sixty-four
fires were caused by persons carelessly throwing lighted cigars
and cigarettes on the ground. This year sixty-eight were
from this bad practice and twenty-eight from careless use of
matches, or more than one-fourth of all of the fires from
these two causes, and something ought to be done to correct
this practice. It ought to be serious offence to throw a
lighted cigar, cigarette or match on the ground.

Your Commissioners are glad to state the owners of property and stores are co-operating with the Department in the
matter of keeping the basements clear of rubbish, and in
this way helping to keep down the losses from fire. fire in
a cellar filled with rubbish is one of the hardest problems a
fireman has to solve.

We wish to thank the publie for the general way in which

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS
they have co-operated with the Department in giving us the
right of way. This is especially desirable since the introduction of auto driven apparatus, and we urge pedestrians to
keep on the sidewalk while the fire alarm is ringing.
There were many accidents to firemen during the year,
but we are glad to say that none of them were of permanent
character.
We trust in making the appropriations for the coming
year, you will make them sufficiently large to enable us to
carry out the following recommendations: .
First. Your Commissioners recommend that as soon as
possible there be appropriated sufficient sum to put in the
new office equipment for the Fire Alarm Signal System, so
that we may get the benefit of our new Cable System. This
should be done at once, as the National Board of Fire Underwriters have repeatedly urged us to install complete, modern
and up-to-date central station fire alarm signal equipment, and
your Commissioners are apprehensive, that unless this is done
without delay, serious results may oecur.
Second. We recommend that special appropriation
be made for to purchase one combination, chemical and
hose wagon, and also one combination, hose and pump.
These would cost about and we also recommend the
purchase of three automobiles for the Chief and Deputy ,
Chiefs, so as to enable the Chiefs to get to fire from various
parts of the city without unnecessary delay. These would
cost in the vicinity of .
Third. Your Commisisoners recommend that as soon as
practicable, the entire Department be changed over from
horse-driven to motor-driven apparatus, as careful investiga- ,
tion will show that it is very much cheaper to maintain the |
motors than horses, and that both on the seore of economy
and efficiency, this change should be made speedily.
Fourth. We also recommend that sufficient sum be
appropriated to install automatic street alarm signals near the |
various Engine Houses which would indicate the approach of

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS  
fire apparatus, as at present, when the apparatus suddenly
comes out of the houses, it  quite dangerous to pedestrians.

Fifth. We recommend that the Engine House in Ward
One be sold and new Engine House erected in better loeation.

. FIRE ALARM TELEGRAPH.
The installation of the underground system has vastly
improved this branch of our service, and we trust that during
the year the new Fire Alarm system will be installed and |
connected with the cable system, which will still further improve this system. |
The value of the apparatus and equipment in this department is as follows, viz.:
$ .
The following is list of the apparatus in the Fire Department, viz.:
  Chief’s automobile.
  Chief’s buggy.
  Assistant’s Chief’s automobile.
  horse-driven Superintendent’s Fire Alarm Wagon.
——————— SSS

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS  

  steam fire engines.

  reserve steam fire engine.

  aerial ladders with tractor.

  hook and ladder trucks, horse-drawn.

  chemical engines.

  combination hose and chemical wagon.

  two-horse hose wagons and sleighs.

  two-horse exercise wagons.

  motor-driven chemical and hose wagons.

  water tower.

HAY AND FEED.

The expense of maintaining this branch of the department has been quite heavy, owing to the increased cost of feed,
and we trust soon to have the department entirely equipped
with motor-driven apparatus and so eliminate this heavy annual expense.

HOUSES.

The houses are in very good condition, except house number four in Ward One, which we have recommended for a
long time ought to be disposed of. The new Headquarters are
proving to be very satisfactory indeed. We think upon the
whole, we have one of the best Engine Houses in New England, and this house is appreciated both by the officers and the
men. Something ought to be done to make the sleeping accommodations in House Number Two better, as they are very
poor indeed.

HOSE. |

 We have on hand feet of good hose and feet
of fair hose. It is very risky to use hose at fires after it becomes old. The life of the rubber is not more than four years.
They do not guarantee this hose for more than three years,
and after that we ought to replace it with new hose.

The following is the amount of hose on hand:

HORSES.

We have twenty-four horses in the Department, and after the experience of number of years with automobiles,
we are more and more convinced that the quicker we can equip
the entire Department with motor-driven apparatus, the better it will be, as the use of motor-driven apparatus is very
much more economical and efficient.

I wish to call your attention once more to the urgent
need of new cow barn and silo, and to increased shed room
for the proper care of farm implements and wagons, now
exposed to all weather conditions.

The piggery here is not credit to the city and should
promptly be removed to suitable location. hope that
your honorable Board will see to it that these reeommendations are seriously considered, and these much needed additions are constructed this year. .

I thank your honorable Board for valuable advice and
assistanee, and also the office force for their unfailing courtesy, and thank the employes under my charge for. their
faithfulness and efficiency.

To City Physician, William P. Ryan, our deepest thanks
are extended for the able and conscientious way he has treated
his patients and for his gentlemanly bearing towards all the
help in this institution.

During the vear start has been made in the erection of
an Isolation Hospital and Public Comfort. Station by the
procuring of plans and advertising for bids for construction.
The contracts for the work were not awarded in that the
bids exded the appropmations. An appropriation of forty :
thousand dollars ($ was made for the Isolation Hospi} tal, and of seven thousand dollars ($ for the construetion of Pubhe Comfort Station. As the lowest bids exded
the appropriations, the Board was unable to award the econtracts. Both of these matters are now before the Board and
with the construction of the new bridge over the railroad at
the foot of Dwight Street, should be disposed of at an early
date.

An additional storv was added to part of the Elm Street
School building, and one room opened for use during the fall
term. The appropriation was sufficient to finish but one room,
the other being left for completion during the coming fiscal
vear. )

The School Board has already asked that this room be .
completed as soon as possible, and in order to accomplish this,
an additional appropriation must be provided in  .

| The fire in Peabody during the fall renewed the activity
of the District. Polive, Inspection Department, and also the
local officials, towards the preventing of possible calamities of
similar nature in this city, and with view of reducing the
fire hazard in our school buildings to minimum, the Massachusetts Distriet Building Inspector with the City Engineer

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC) WORKS 
and the Chief of the Fire Department made an examination
of the local school buildings early in November.

In the main, the Holvoke public school buildings were
found to be in satisfactory condition, but changes of minor
nature were recommended, and the recommendations are now
being carried out. The Board hopes to have the work completed early in  .

As whole, public buildings in this eity are in very good
eondition, but during the coming vear the ordinary repairs
and the maintenance must be made, and it is well to bear in
mind that the number of buildings is constantly increasing,
three buildings having been added to the lst the current
year, making forty-four buildings to be maimtained by
this department.

The Foard again recommends the extending of the eleetric lighting system in all school buildings not now thus
equipped, viz: the Elm Street, East Dwight Street, Elmwood
(South Street), Hamilton Street, Kirtland, Nonotuck Street,
Park Street, Sargeant Street and Springdale Schools. The
Lawrenee School has very limited electrie lighting service,
and the South Chestnut Street School building is practically
Without electric hghting. It is question whether these buildings should be wired, owing to the possibility that they may
be consolidated in the proposed new Central Grammar School
building, plans for which have been in course of preparation
for some few months. !

Late in the fall the Board received request from the
Board of Aldermen for an estimate of the cost of constructing municipal garage suitable for caring for the city’s machines. The matter is now in the hands of the City Engi-.
neer who has been asked to present to this Board such estt mate. In many ways it appears that the erection of such a
building would prove of benefit to the City, but further investigation may reveal facts not known at the present time.

The Gas and Electric Department. removed its offices
from the first floor of the City Hall building to its new quarters in the basement in October which were vaeated by the

asd REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS .
 Police Department removing to the City Hall Annex and Pohee Building.

The offices vacated by the Gas and Electric Department
will be occupied by the Assessors, the Tax Collector and the
City Messenger, and re-arrangement of some offices on the
first floor of the City Hall building will be made.

The Emerald Engine House and the Carleton Street
School buildings were razed during the past summer, and it is
planned to use the material or such of it as may be possible
in the construction of the proposed Isolation Hospital.

It isthe opinion of this Board that the City should perform all of the work in connection with the construction of
permanent roadways, this policy having been advocated consistently by the Board in previous vears. This vear small
beginnmg was made in the purchase of road building machinery, large and small concrete mixer being purchased.
The Board believes that additional machinery for road econstruction should be purchased the coming year.

A complete portable and modern asphalt mixing plant
should be procured. Also two automobile outfits:to be used
as combination asphalt, oil, tar and water distributors and
trucks for the haulage of road building material. It  possible to change this class of machine from oiling outfits to automcbile trucks within very short period of time, so that
there may be no necessity of tving up large investment in
one particular machine. These machines ean be used to advantage not only in the construectron of permanent roadways
within the city Imits, but in the repairs, maintenance and
rebuilding of country highways, construction work upon
which at the present time must be performed with the idea
of accommodating automobile traffic in excess of horse drawn
vehicles. In this connection the purchase of portable stone
crushing outfit may well be considered, but with erushed
stone procurable at price that the City is able to obtain,
and with automobile transportation it would be well to give

the matter serious consideration and not arrive at hasty
conclusion,

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  |

Certain it is that the supply of suitable road making
material within the limits of the country highways is being
rapidly exhausted and there are few accessible good gravel
supplies near to the heavily traveled suburban roadways. The
maintenance of the Easthampton road and the road leading
to Westfield through Elmwood, Cherry Street extension and
the roadways in the vicinity of the Ashley reservoirs can
only be maintained within reasonable item of expense by
the cheaper means of transportation offered by the automobile. The application of coal tar or water gas oil which can
be procured at very reasonable rates from the municipal
lighting plant, or even the use of asphaltic oils of the heavier
percentages will, in the opinion of the Board, furnish an
economical and satisfactory method of preserving the counttrv roads for considerable length of time, and also eluninate
the dust nuisance complained of to great extent upon the
highways near the city, that are used extensively for pleas.
ure drives by motorists.

The Board recommends the purchase of the lot on Commercial Street between the present City Yard property and
Sargeant Street for use in connection with the City Yard.
Also the erection on the lot of suitable buildings for the use
of the apparatus of the outdoor department, and the building of the necessary equipment for the storage and delivery
of materials used for construction purposes, especially the
construction of storage bins and the necessary -trestles for
crushed stone.

There is before the Board number of petitions for the
extension of sewers and the providing of sewage facilities in
new tracts, particularly west of Northampton street. If this
work is to be done it will necessitate the rearrangement of the
flow of some of the sewers and also sizeable appropriation.
As the City expands and new residences are erected, demands
on the sewer department are materially mereased.

This is also equally true in the sidewalk department, and

: if new sections are to be taken over by the City and the
streets improved and made public thoroughfares, considD  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS .
erable amount must be expended from the Highway department in the hardening of roadways.

The fact should not be lost. sight of that as the City expands, the expenditures in all departments must necessarily
icrease and there are many reasons for the inereased expenditures, as those familiar with the eost of construction
at the present time will attest. It is not an exaggeration
that work which was done during the early life of the Board
can now be done only at. largely increased expense, in many
cases the increase runs from fifty to sixty per cent, and the
eost of work done during the coming vear will be considera bly in exeess of like work performed during the past two or |
three years, owing to the rapid advance in the cost of buildIng materials.
The Highland Park Sewer System has ben econstrueted
only as far as the river, and part of the conerete retaining
walls on the river bank. To comply with the requirements
of the State Department of Health, it will be necessary to extend this sewer through iron pipe into low water flow of the
river, the sewer to be of sufficient size as to eare for the ordinary flow of the svstem, while excess surface water will be
discharged by overflow at the river bank.

The Board finds that the new ordinance relative to sewer

connections has worked satisfactorily and believes that some
system should be devised whereby the wearing surfaces of
highways should not be replaced except by emplovees of this
department, the expense being charged to the parties benefited. There have been many cases in the past where streets
have been disturbed, nnproperly replaced, and after short. |
time additional repairs made at the expense of the City.
This has eaused considerable ineconvemience to the traveling
pubhie and in some eases accidents with resulting losses.

The Board beheves that charges made against property
owners for work of any nature in streets whereby the abutting property receives benefit, should be when refunded to
the City, credited to the department doing the work and
from which the charge is originally paid. At the present time

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS 
money received for doing work is credited to the General Recelpt account, and the department doing the work receives
no benefit for the expense it has been put to in making sewer
connections, the laying of curbing, constructing sidewalks or
re-laying services on any street dug up by private individuals
or public service corporations. If it is not desired to refund
the money paid out by the various departments for services,
we believe that special appropriation for this class of work
should be made.

It is hoped that continuation of the construction of
permanent roadways will be made the coming year. During the past vear parts of Sargeant Street, Union Street,
Hampden Street, Hitchcock Street, Northampton Street and
Pleasant Street have been permanently improved.

The pavement of Main Street, east side, between Jackson Street and the third level canal, and the pavement of
Dwight Street between Main Street and the New York, New
Haven and Hartford Railroad tracks has been relaid.

On Sargeant Street. four thousand three hundred and
twenty-two square yards of concrete pavement was
laid at total cost of  cents per square yard. On Union
Street the pavement was of the same material, with total
vardage of two thousand four hunded and sixty-five )
square vards and total cost of  cents per square yard.
The asphaltic roadway laid upon four-inch concrete base
on Hampden Street between Nonotuck Street and Northampton Street, covering six thousand one hundred and  ninetynine square yards cost  per square yard,
while Hampden Street between School Street and Lincoln
Street was improved with re-cut granite blocks laid upon a
four )-inch concrete base, covering vardage of one thousand six hundred and eighty-seven square yards at
a total cost of  per square yard. The Hitcheocek 
Street pavement covered one thousand five hundred and
fourteen square vards laid upon five and one-half

( )-inch base with one-half )-inch tarvia wearing
surface, at cost of  per square yard. The

D REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS Main Street pavement was laid upon four )-inch
base with recut granite blocks to the extent of one thousand
and thirty-seven square vards, at cost of 
per square yard. On Northampton Street the improvement
extended from Cherry Street to the top of the Whiting Hill,
so-called, covering fifteen thousand and twenty )
square vards of base and fourteen thousand eight hundred
and eighty square yards of wearing surface, at a
total cost of  per vard. tarvia roadway of one-half
( ,)-inch wearing surface was constructed on Pleasant
Street, east of the street car tracks, from Lincoln Street
northerly to the ravine. The pavement was laid upon five

— and one-half ,)-inech concrete base and along the easterly
rail three courses of brick were laid to take the jay from
the rail from the tarvia surface. The total yardage of roadWay improved was one thousand six hundred and  eightyseven square vards of which one thousand five hundred
and fifty-seven square yards were of the tarvia surface and one hundred and thirty square yards of brick. The total cost of the tarviaized section was 
per square vard and the brick  per square vard. On
Dwight Street where the brick pavement was relaid between
Race Street and the New York, New Haven and Hartford
Race Street and the New York, New Haven and Hartford railroad tracks the total vardage was two thousand eight hundred
and ninety-six square yards, the cost peryard .
A small portion of brick paving was laid at the entrance of )
the Elmwood (South Street) Engine House, where brick superseded the tar concrete driveway. The brick were laid on
a four )-inch conerete base at cost of  per square
yard.

The street signs erected number of years ago by the
Board have in many cases disappeared or the lettering has
become obliterated. The congestion of traffic at many street
intersections will necessitate more efficient method of handling this traffie and the protection of pedestrians at street
crossings. It is estimated that during the coming year at

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS 
least fifteen hundred dollars ($ will be required to
make start in re-establishing street signs and for erecting
the necessary traffie protection posts at the congested intersections. .

The Board again, as in past, recommends that attention
be given to the two bridges crossing the Connecticut river,
to all of the canal bridges and the bridges spanning the Boston and Maine Railroad tracks, connecting Dwight Street
with East Dwight Street. All of the bridges owned by the
City are in need of thorough examination, and nearly all
of them, we believe, will be found in need of many repairs.

The Board is of the opinion that the work required on these
bridges, if properly done, will necessitate an expenditure of
not less than ten thousand dollars ($ ).

It is to the minds of the Board bad economy to delay
from year to year needed repairs to the bridges, and to put
off the time of reckoning until new bridges must be constructed, where the existing structures could be maintained
safe for traffic for some vears by early attention to repairs
and painting. )

The Board will request at the proper time an appropriation sufficient to cover the placing of all our bridges in proper
condition.

During the summer an examination of the bridge connecting Dwight Street with East Dwight Street was made
by the Chief Engineer of the Boston and Main Railroad, the
City Engineer and representative of the Public Service
Commission, Inspection Department. The three engineers
agreed that the bridge was unsafe for the traffie permitted on
the bridge, and advised its replacement. by another strueture. Some of the fabricated work and plates were found to
be badly rusted, rendering unfit to carry the dead load of the
bridge and entirely inadequate to maintain the structure under the live load that the structure might be called upon to |
sustain. Temporary repairs were made and the available

; floor space reduced, which has made the bridge safe for very
limited time. The structure must be replaced at the earliest

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS

possible time or closed for traffic. Its continued use is dangerous. By permitting its use longer than is absolutely necessary renders the City Hable at any time for accidents
likely to occur. Should this structure fall under temporary
emergency loading, and in front of approaching trains, the
result is not one pleasant to contemplate.

The matter of replacing this bridge has been taken up
with the Engineering Department of the Boston and Maine
Railroad, and tentative contract has been presented by the
railroad and is now being considered by this Board. There
is an appropriation for bridges, whieh was made number
of vears ago, but the amount available is hardly sufficient
to construct modern structure such as is needed in this location.

It is hoped that plans and specifications may be prepared for new bridge, and that the actual work of construetion may be begun early in the coming year. In the minds
of the Board there would be no extenuating circumstances
in case of accident, and the work of replacing this bridge
should not be delayed longer than the time absolutely necessary for the preparation of the proper plans and the awarding of the contracts.

The planking of the roadways on the South Hadley Falls .
and Willimansett Bridges wears under the ordinary traffie
about two vears. The cost of this work is such that the

Board beheves preparation should be made to lay wooden
block pavement upon both of the bridges at such time as it
Is necessary to again replank them. The plank on the South
Hadley Falls bridge is showing signs of wear and something
must be done the coming year. The Willimansett Bridge
was replanked during the current season, and the plank
should wear for two years. The matter is of such importance
that it should receive serious consideration. The laying of
wooden block roadways on the bridges will be saying of no
* small amount in vears to come.

It may be of interest to the general publie that the

sewer department has removed during the past year three

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
thousand five hundred and eighty-eight loads of matter from catch basins; the street cleaning department has removed nine thousand nine hundred and forty-nine )

. loads of street sweepings and fourteen thousand, seven hundred and eighty-five cans of matter by push carts.
The alley department has removed twenty-seven thousand,
two hundred and sixtv-three loads of ashes, and two thou- .
sand one hundred and eighty-eight loads of paper.

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  

October the Board authorized George P. B. Al: derman Co. to draw plans and specifications for proposed

| eentral grammar school building, with the understanding that
the site west of Maple Street between Cabot and Hampshire
Streets was to be utilized for this purpose. -The architects |
have. been in conference with the School Committee at various
times, we understand, concerning these plans and have se- |
eured from the Committee an original idea of the layout of
the structure. While no sketches or other details in connec tion with the plans have been presented to this Board, it is
understood that the matter is so well in hand that definite
working sketch can be presented within short time if desired. No appropriations have as yet been made covering this
work, and until the same are made no further action will be
taken in the premises by the Board.

The new method of assessments is matter of vital importance to the City in maintaining liens against property
benefited by the laying out of streets or other improvements,
the construction of sidewalks, laying of curbing and building
of sewers, as covered by Chapter of the Acts of  entitled, ‘‘An Act Relative to Municipal Liens for Publie Improvements,’’ which provides that assessments shall be levied
upon the parcels of land, as the ownership exists on April  
next preceding the completion of the work. The assessments
shall describe each parcel of land assessed and give the names
of the owners at the time of assessment. The same shall be
accompanied by plan showing in detail the lots assessed,
and in order to preserve the lien copy of the assessment, together with plan, shall be filed in the Registry of Decds office within thirty days after assessment. The work entailed

in complying with this law does not appear at glance, but
it has placed upon this department more than three times the
amount of work in levying assessments as existed heretofore |
without apparently giving to the City additional benefits.

The City will be called upon to face within short time
the relocation of the shooting range of Company D. The present range is so situated that with the opening of residential

a  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
, sections west of Northampton Street encroachments are made
elose upon the range property. The Board has no official
knowledge regarding new location, but it has been unofficially
informed that the state or interests of the City will demand a
change in the near future. The present location is as good
as any that can be found in the suburbs of the city, and efforts should be made to retain it as long as possible.
We hope for the continued co-operation of our citizens
for the suecess of the department.

THOMAS J. LYNCH, Chairman,
