MAYOR'S ADDRESS.

To the Honorable, the Board of Aldermen:
FINANCES.

The city of Holyoke begins the year on sound
financial basis. The Departments have paid their obligations
in full and their work of the year has been started with no
old indebtedness of any kind to be paid up.

During the year an unusual amount of money was
borrowed due very largely to the purchase of land for play‘grounds and for locations for public buildings and although
the amount expended in this way was somewhat large, it
seemed wise to secure the land while it was yet available.

The net debt of the city, leaving out the Water and Gas
and Electric Departments, is The borrowing
capacity of the city is The excess of assets
owned by the city over its liabilities is but in
reality this is an underestimate if we take into account that
the Holyoke and Westfield Railroad stock is only figured at
par, that the value of the Water Works and Gas and Electric
plants very much exd the valuations placed upon them
by the Assessors, and that no account at all is made of
the personal property owncd by the city.

On October first of this year there will fall due bonds in
the amount of  which were issued in renewal for
bonds issued to pay for the Holyoke and Westfield Railroad
stock which was originally purchased for the city. special
act was passed last year by the Legislature authorizing
the city to refund this loan on serial basis so that it may

, |
|
  MAYOR'S ADDRESS
gradually be paid off and in time leave the city with this
splendid investment free and clear of any indebtedness.
GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT.
The Gas and Electric Department had in prosper- |
ous year. The total output of gas did not increase very much,
but the total output of electricity was phenomenal, the current sent out showing an increase of per cent over the
total amount sent out the preding year. The total income
for the entire department was  in excess of the |
total income for the year  At the station the work
of additional improvement begun in was completed and at the gas works four new purifiers were installed.
The Department will this year make every effort to keep |
along without adding new apparatus at the station, but if
the demand for electric current increases in anything like
the same proportion this year as last year, it will be very 
difficult to go through next winter without some further additions to the plant. At the Gas Works the question of new
benches of retorts is something which will very soon have to
be taken up. In addition to the advantage of low prices for
gas and electricity for lighting purposes, Holyoke is deriving
a very great advantage from its plants in low prices for electric power and that is one reason which our citizens should
not lose sight of, for the present remarkable industrial ,
development of this city. !
BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.

The Board of Public Works continued during the year
  developing the public works of this city. large amount
was expended for sewers, curbing, sidewalks and for permanently improved streets. The Ingleside underpass, was
begun and is nearing completion. splendid bridge was
erected over the first level canal on Sargeant street. New
me

/
| MAYOR'S ADDRESS  
sanitaries were installed in the Park Street School, and storm
water sewer system was put in to serve the Oakdale district
rendering that section of the city more healthful and free from
dampness. Forestry Department was established, and
a it is hoped that this city will be able, as result of this policy,
to sce its trees preserved and escape the ravages which have
visited other municipalities. In the year before us, aside
from other important work, the undertakings which should
be completed are the furnishing of the Ingleside School, the
building of contagious disease hospital and the improving
of Railroad street.
SCHOOLS.

The schools of the city are at the present time demonstrating efficiency and showing good results. The  principals and teachers are cach year gaining in ability and showing
an added interest, and with an able Superintendent and a

 Board working in harmony with him, we can safely look forward to most successful year. movement has been
started to make of the schoolhouses social centers for the
neighborhoods in which they are located, and in my opinion
this movement should be in every way encouraged officially
by the city. The building of the Ingleside School of absolutely fire proof construction marks change in policy in the
erection of school buildings, which believe should never be
departed from in the future. This city can no longer afford
to take any chances in the destruction by fire of the lives of
its school children.

The question of additional school accomodations is a
problem which the city must face this year and is matter

 which should receive the most careful consideration on the
| part of all Boards and officials concerned.
WATER DEPARTMENT. ,

The Water Department had most successful year and
many things were done which were of great advantage to the

fe

  MAYOR'S ADDRESS
city. Aside from large number of extensions, additional
work was done on the Rock Cut and on the canal and road
at the Whiting Street Reservoir, and in other ways. The
Department was splendidly managed financially and closed
the year with balance of  in addition to ,
which the sum of  was placed in the sinking fund.  
The amount of  was saved by the reduction of
the water rates, an actual saving which should be appreciated
by citizens and water users alike.
The commissioners showed their sympathy with the
pregressive work of the city by abating all charges for water ,
for fountains, for the wading pool at Riverside Park and for
skating ponds. |
PARKS AND PUBLIC PLAYGROUNDS. ,
The Park Board is continuing its work of developing
our park area, adopting the wise policy of doing each year :
what the city can reasonably afford. In the year just closed,
considerable work was done at Elmwood Park and at Riverside Park and plans have now been completed for the development of new park at Jones’ Point. At Riverside Park
a wading pool was completed and preparations have been |
made for the erection of an outdoor gymnasium. During
the year, in pursuance of the vote of the citizens in the election of  land was purchased for playgrounds and abeginning was made in playground development by the Park :
Board and also by the Inspector of Public Buildings in con- |
nection with the school grounds. It is to be hoped that this |
year such work can be still further advanced and some defi- |
nite playground policy established. The playground movement is one of the most important movements which this or "
any other city faces at the present time. |
POLICE DEPARTMENT.
The Department of Police had in successful .
year. Considering the increase of population, there was
a

MAYOR'S ADDRESS  
relatively decrease in the number of arrests and an absence
of serious crime. Holyoke continues to demonstrate its
claim that it is one of the most orderly manufacturing cities
anywhere to be found. The creation of the office of Sargeant has been demonstrated to be wise move and is great
help to the Department. The next improvement which I
believe should be made, is the creation of police reserve
force under the statutes of the Commonwealth. The
establishment of such force has proved great advantage to
other cities and it would be, in my opinion, of assistance to
the efficiency of the Department in this city. would recommend this matter to the consideration of the Board of Aldermen.

FIRE DEPARTMENT.

Holyoke has superb Fire Department, which, measured
by results is one of the most efficient in the United States.
Some idea of this may be obtained from condensed summary of statistics for the last ten years. During this period the buildings in which fires have occurred were valued
at The value of the property damaged by
fire was The total amount of insurance paid
on the damaged property was  and the total
net loss, above the insurance, paid to the citizens of Holyoke
for this period of ten years was which, averaging
the city’s population at  made gross loss for each
inhabitant per year of less than dollar and net loss of
six cents or trifle over sixty cents for the period of ten years.
For the year Holyoke had one of the lowest per capita
fire losses of any city in the entire country and the lowest of
any manufacturing community. Results such as these
should be source of pride to every citizen of the city. The
immediate need of the Department it its gradual equipment
with automobile fire apparatus, policy which should be
begun this year and continued from year to year as the finances of the city permit.

&
sJ
  MAYOR'S ADDRESS
BOARD OF HEALTH.
The Department of Health has well and ably safeguarded and protected the health of the city so far as its
powers enable. The city has been of late, remarkably free 
from contagious diseases. The officials connected with
the Department have performed their duties efficiently
' and the establishment of the oftice of bacteriologist has proved
a distinct advantage. The most important work of the year
was the purchasing of beautiful location for contagious
disease hospital and the employment of the Olmsted Bros.
to lay it out in manner appropriate to its location. If
the Board of Aldermen deem it wise to provide funds,  would
seem than nothing more important for the health of the city
could be done this year, than the erection of this hospital.
RELIEF DEPARTMENT. “
‘“
The Relief Department shows an expenditure for Ig 
of something about  less than for  fact which
not alone speaks well for the management of the Department
but is evidence of better industrial conditions. In the near
future, the subject of new heating system at the City Farm
should receive consideration.
BOARD OF ASSESSORS.
The Board of Assessors continued during the year just
closed to perform its work with remarkable ethciency and
ability and in conformity with the laws of the Commonwealth.
The manner in which this Board has for long number of !
years performed its duties is one that has won the respect and
admiration of experts and students of the problem of taxation, and it ranks at the present time as one of the most
honest and efficient Boards in the entire Commonwealth.
Not only does it have its work systematized in thoroughly

MAYOR'S ADDRESS  
scientific way, but citizens can find in the Assessors’ office
valuable information in regard to conveyances of property
and concerning the history of the record title of the real
estate in the city.

DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICIALS IN GENERAL.

The work of the other Departments and officials has
in the main been excellent and worthy of commendation.
Only words of praise can be spoken of the manner in which
the offices of City Treasurer and the City Auditor are administrated. Holyoke is indeed fortunate to have in
charge of its finances officials of such ability and honesty
as are Mr. Bonvouloir and Mr. Kenney.

The City Engineering Department conducted during
the year with its usual ability the engineering work of the
city and good instance of the skill of the City Engineer and
his assistants was displayed in the planning and construction of the beautiful Sargeant Street bridge.

The amount of work performed by the City Solicitor
each year increases, but the ability and energy of the City
Solicitor has ample proof in the statement in his report that
at the close of the fiscal year that there was only one
unfinished case against the city of Holyoke in the court
dockets.

It is pleasure for me to be able to testify to the accurate
and thorough manner in which the duties of the offices of the
City Clerk have been performed by the present City Clerk
and his assistant. |

The matter of the collection of taxes is difficult problem, but this Department has shown very good results under
the administration of the present Collector, although he is
troubled, as are all Collectors in Massachusetts, by the
tendency on the part of many tax payers to defer payment
of taxes. It would seem that at some time in the near future
there should be some reform in the procedure in payment of

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS
taxes in Massachusetts, so that cities and towns will not
be obliged to pay the amount of interest which they now do
for making temporary loans in anticipation of tax payments.
The amount of work thrown upon the City Physician
each year increases and am able to say that the present ,
official has performed that work faithfully and well. |
The report of the Sealer of Weights and Measures shows )
that more work has been done by his Department this year
than ever before and believe that the value of this work is .
each year becoming more apparent. !
Holyoke is enjoying period of business and industrial
development. The resulting increase in building and in
population means of course greater demands upon the city.
I believe that we are in good position to deal with such de- |
mands, but it is needless for me to say that they can be more |
readily met if the most careful economy consistent with
progress is practiced by Departments and officials. In |
the matter of permanent work, such permanent work as is
necessary to the progress of the city should be attempted,
and when attempted, thoroughly performed, but permanent
work which ts not really needed should be deferred until it
becomes necessity.
In the year before us we have an opportunity to render
service of value to our city. We may not be able to accomplish all we plan or wish, but we can at least give the best
we possess of purpose and ability. One thing is sure, and that
is, the city of Holyoke is worthy of every effort we can put
forth, and if at the end of this year, through any endeavors of
ours, it shall be finer and better place in which to live, we
can consider ourselves well repaid for all the time and strength
we give to its service. ’

REPORT OF WATER BOARD  
December .

I hereby certify that have examined the cash book and
the daily collection book of the Water Department for the
fiscal year ending November found them correctly
added and the vouchers for payment properly approved.
The cash balance, has been verified.

D. W. KENNEY,
City Auditor.

The improvements made during the year include main
pipe extensions amounting to feet, besides pipe laid for
hydrants the size of mains laid ranging from four inch to
ten inch; the extending of the concrete arch over the Rock
Cut Canal, building of an end wall at the easterly end of the
arch, and doing part of the grading; the setting out of  
white pine seedlings on the Ashley Pond watershed and
thinning out the tree growth along the lines recommended by
theState Forester; the construction of brick intake well around
the outlet pipe at the High Service reservoir, arranged with
stop planks so the water can be drawn either from the surface or from the different levels; the widening of the roadway
at the Whiting Street reservoir and hardening of the same,
and building an addition to the concrete canal through which
the water from the upper reservoir flows after being aerated
by the fountain, and changing the motive power at the department’s shop by the substitution of electric motors for
the gas engine, the motors and shafting so arranged that
most of the machines can now be run ndependently, resulting in considerable saving in the operating cost at the shop.
The Board also purchased horse power Knox Automobile
for the use of the Superintendent, which enables him to keep |
a closer supervision over the work being done by the men
under his charge. The tonneau of the machine ts removable,
and box is provided for carrying men and tools and can be

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD

attached in its place, making not onlya good emergency
equipment, but very useful at other times. When the tonneau is attached, sufficient seating capacity is provided for
the Commissioners, Superintendent and Engineer and the
machine may thus be used by the Board on trips of inspection to the reservoirs, or in viewing the work being done in
different parts of the city. The Superintendent’s report
shows the improvements more in detail, and is printed as a
part of this report.

The Board purchased acres of land situated at the
southeasterly side of Ashley Pond from Elizabeth P. Macnaughtan, et al., and acres of land at the southwesterly
side of the Whiting Street Reservoir were bought from the
Pequot Fishing Club. Action also has been taken for the
purchase of approximately acres of land on the Bray Brook
watershed. These purchases were made for the purpose of
giving the Board more complete control of the watersheds '
around the ponds and reservoirs and thereby insure the proper
sanitary protection of the same.

The gross receipts for the fiscal year were ,
and the expenditures while the balance on hand
at the close of the year, was  in excess
of the balance on hand at the close of the previous fiscal
year. Thereceipts from water rents amounted to ,
as against  for the previous twelve months, decrease of only although reduction of approximately
$  per year gross, or  net, if we deduct the ten
per cent allowed for prompt payment, was made in the domestic water rates, dating from January Ist. Allowing for
this reduction, the receipts from water rents show gain of
$ The expenditures included  for interest
on bonds,  paid to the city for taxes and transfer
of  to the Sinking Fund, besides  expended for main pipe extensions, etc., including the purchase
of land. The additions to the Sinking Fund amounted to
$ making the total amount in the fund at the
close of the fiscal year,  of the amount

es
REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  lI
added was transferred from the water rents account, the balance being income from investments.

The Board is having plans prepared by the Engineer
and Superintendent for improvements at the Rock Cut Canal
and Wright Pond to include the razing of the present Wright
Pond gatehouse, installing new head-gate at the canal
entrance, cleaning out the westerly end of the canal and extending the concrete arch, and grading up the banks on either
side of the canal. |

There has been an ample supply of water for all purposes, no restrictions having to be placed on the use of water
either for domestic or manufacturing purposes, notwithstanding the fact that we have passed through two very dry seasons. This is very gratifying when we consider the extremities to which some of the water departments throughout the
state were put to avoid water famine. The Board feels, .
however, that the time has arrived when steps should be
taken toward the building of storage reservoir at Fomer,
Southampton, recommended by Engineer James L. Tighe
in his report of November to conserve the water
that now must be lost during the spring and fall months and
at times of heavy rainfall. Our present reservoir at Fomer
is an intake reservoir with capacity of only gallons
and at periods of heavy rainfall enormous quantities of water
are lost. While our water supply has been able to mect the
demands made upon it up to the present time, at the rate our
city is growing and the population increasing, it will not be
many years before our reservoirs will not be equal to the
demand, and in order to be prepared for such time it is necessary to commence work on this new storage reservoir.
The necessary funds could probably be raised by loan, and
as the whole amount would not be needed for some time, authorization might be obtained from the legislature for the full
amount of the loan, but with permission to borrow the money
and issue bonds therefor from time to time as may be
deemed advisable.

Holyoke is not only fortunate in the matter of its sources

of water supply, but also in its pipe lines and the arrangement of the distribution system, which with nearly public
fire hydrants located at convenient points throughout the
city, with pressure in the business sections of to  
pounds, afford excellent means for the extinguishment of
fires, and are quite factor in keeping down the insurance
rates. |

Report of the Superintendent.
To the Honorable Board of Water Commissioners:
GENTLEMEN: |
I have the honor to present the report of your superintendent for the year ending November .
Five electric motors were installed for driving the various
machines in the repair shop and the shafting rearranged so
that each machine may be operated separately. Since the
installation of the motors the cost of power has been but |
small fraction of the cost of running the gas engine which !
was formerly used in the repair shop.
In September your Board purchased an automobile for ,
the Department. It  Model ‘‘O” Knox of H. P. with
removable tonneau. When the tonneau its removed box
for carrying tools and supplies is used and on the box two
regular carriage seats can be placed making it possible to
carry seven men and the driver with the necessary tools for
doing emergency work. The automobile enables your super- ,
intendent to personally sce more of the work under his charge ,
and allows him ample time for office duties. With the horses |
that were formerly used by the superintendent  was almost
impossible to visit all the reservoirs in one day, but with the
automobile the whole ground can be covered tn less than one !
half day with time left to attend to other details. Taking
into consideration the saving in labor on account of extra
work that can be accomplished by your superintendent and
his men we can show that the automobile is valuable asset in the Department.
|

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.

Although the amount expended upon the distribution
system is less than the average yearly amount, the extensions
were made primarily to increase the fire protection and but
two of the lines mentioned below were laid to accommodate
new buildings. During the year there has been laid but
  feet of new street mains, at cost of making
the water pipe mileage about miles.

In Canal street inch main was laid from Cabot street
northerly distance of feet, passing under the main
line of the B. M. railroad, to the end of the main laid in
  south of the Whitmore Mfg. Co.'s mill. This main removes dead end and connects the distribution system of
Ward one with the distribution system of Ward two,
which were heretofore connected only at Main street.
Five other dead ends were connected with not far distant
pipes in intersecting streets as follows:  .

( The dead end in East street, south of Sargeant
street, was connected with the Park street main; The
Spring street pipe was connected with the main in Race
street; the dead end at the corner of Grover and Lyman

: streets was removed by extending the Grover St. pipe to connect
with the main in Lyman street; the dead end on Hamilton street was removed by laying feet of inch pipe
and connecting with the main in Race street; the dead
end on Summer street north of Mosher was removed by
laying feet of inch pipe to connect with the new main
in Mosher street.

In St. Jerome avenue feet of inch main was laid
from Sargeant street to Franklin street. The eight inch
main in Winter street was extended from the Holyoke Belting Co.’s building distance of feet to the building owned
by the Feigenspan Brewing Co.

A six inch main was laid in East street, Ward one, from
Canal street to the northerly side of Lyman street distance
of feet. |

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.
An eight inch main feet in length was laid in Mosher !
street from Canal street to East street. |
A new inch main has been laid in South Main street, |
Springfield Road, fect in length from the intersection of |
the Upper Road with the Springfield Road to point near the |
southerly line of land of A. A. Jones. |
In Roosevelt avenue feet of inch pipe and feet
of inch pipe has been laid to accommodate new cottages
built this year.
The inch main that was laid in Mosher street between
Bridge and East street in the year was taken out when
the inch main was laid this year and relaid in Roosevelt
avenue.
Four new hydrants were set this year at cost of .
Eighty-nine new services, making total length of
  feet were laid at cost of  and old services
were replaced with lead lined pipe at cost of .
Many of the smaller mains contain considerableamount
of tubercles, vegetable growth and sediment. Such deposits
reduce the carrying capacity of the mains and destroys
their efficiency for fire purposes. would suggest that we
try the experiment of cleaning some of these mains.
WORK AT THE RESERVOIRS.
The work of building the concrete arch over the canal
at Wright’s pond was continued, the easterly end of the arch
with its spandrel walls was finished and the grading over
the arch commenced this year. On this work  was
expended for labor and materials. Plans are now being
prepared for the completion of this work. The plans comprehend the extension of the arch about feet westerly
and the building of an end wall over the same to retain the
filling and grading; the building of new intake or head gate
for the canal at Wright's pond, and the work of changing
the course of the canal and building proper retaining walls

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
between the end of the arch and the intake. All of the work
planned cannot be accomplished in one season, but trust
your board will be able to set aside at least  for this
particular work next year.

At the high service reservoir brick intake well was
built, on foundation of concrete around the pipe that leads
to the gate house. The cost of the intake well was .
The well was built to permit the water to be drawn from any
elevation of the reservoir by removing stop planks which were
placed from the bottom to the top on the west side of the
well.

During the first week of May about §,  white pine
seedlings were set out, at the southerly end of Ashley ponds,
under the direction of the Assistant State Forester. fear
that the very dry summer and fall has had depressing effect upon the seedlings and that it is question of how many
will be active next spring. This department has hundreds
of acres of land capable of supporting forest growth, now
lying idle about the reservoirs and though our first attempt
at forest planting should not be successful we ought not to
feel daunted, but should try again and keep at it until all
the barren land is turned into healthy forest. Acting upon
the suggestion of the State Forester, nearly acres of
growing woods, near the high service reservoir, was treated
by removing the dead, the crocked and the diseased trees.
The immediate result of this work was one of material  mprovement of the water shed, but the ultimate result of such
work is timber land of immeasurable value to this department. hope you will continue the treatment on every acre
of woods owned by this department.

Improvements costing  at the Whiting Street
reservoir consist of widening and hardening the roadway
around the reservoir, enlarging and lengthening culverts,
extending the canal that leads from the aerating fountain
and building fences on property lines. The improvements
on the roadway are about half done and hope to sce the
work finished next year.

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.
CONDITION OF THE WATER. |

The quality of the water furnished this year has been
very good with the exception of the water from the High
Service reservoir. When my report of was written
this reservoir was empty for the reasons mentioned in said
report. On February the intake well, mentioned
above, was finished and the water from Fomer turned into
the High Service reservoir. On Sunday, June this
water was turned into the mains. On October  we had |
complaints of foul tasting water in the High Service dictrict.
Every day brought forth more complaints than the preceding day, until October  when the reservoir was put out of
commission and Fomer water supplied the district. Uroglena was the cause of the bad odor and taste. The High
Service reservoir is still out of commission, meanwhile the
district is supplied from the upper Whiting Street reservoir.*

Thanking you for your uniform kindness of the past year,
this report is respectfully submitted.

JOHN J. KIRKPATRICK,

| Superintendent.

*Uroglena disappeared during the second week of January,
 and the water from the High Service reservoir was
turned into the mains January  IgIO.

REPORT OF |
SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
To Hig Honor, the Mayor, and the Citizens of Holyoke:

In presenting this, the annual report of the School
Committee, we desire to call attention to certain facts worthy
of special consideration.

Various important changes have been made, among
which we name as of first importance the revision of the
Rules and Regulations of the Board, which have been in
effect since January Ist. Of more direct influence upon the
work of the schools was the modification of the rules governing the term of service and powers of the Superintendent,
whereby provision was made for three year term of service with sole appointive power. This action of the Board
we believe to have been decided step ‘n advance, and this
belief is confirmed by the mterest it has aroused in other
New England cities. The changes were made at the regular meeting of the Board in April and are now in effect under
a new superintendent.

The new Oakdale School, one of our most attractive
buildings, which in honor of former superintendent was
called the Kirtland School, was opened in January and is
now running with every room oecupied.

A new four room building has been started at Ing eside to replace the present small and overcrowded schoolhouse. The new site is well chosen and ample for the building and adjoining plavgrounds. Only three rooms will be
used as class rooms, the remaining space on the second floor
being fitted as school hall.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE. |
New and very satisfactory sanitaries have been built
at the Park Street School, making decided and much
needed improvement. .
: The manual training equipment at the High School )
has been rearranged, the heavy machinery being moved to !
the basement, thus placing this department in larger and
permanent quarters. ;
The need of new building in the North Chestnut
Street district is too well recognized to require more than
passing mention. The building is not only too small for
present needs but is most unfortunately arranged and would
scarcely be tolerated in any other progressive city. The |
Crowded conditions in this district, together with the congestion in the South Chestnut Street School, the Appleton |
Street, West Street and Elmwood Schools led to the appointment late in the year of special committee to consider
the question of additional school accommodations —throughout the city. The committee is now studying the prob em ,
and is expected to report carly next year.
Among the further needs of the department should
be mentioned the placing of shower baths in the basement
of the High School; making such alterations as wil lighten
the entrance of the Hamilton Street School; putting extra |
blackboards into four rooms of the Kirtland School; and :
making such changes in the front doors and stairways at
the Nonotuck Street building as will make this safe exit
for young children.
For fuller particulars regarding the work of the department reference is made to the accompanying detailed
reports and statistical tables. .

REPORT OF THE .
Superint
uperin enden and Secre ary
To the School Committee of Holyoke:

This annual report of the Superintendent of Schools—
the forty-sixth of the series—is based upon short study
of the Holyoke school system, its expenditure, organization,
efficiency and growth. In presenting this form of report,
my only desire is to submit briefly such facts as will result in
the formation of more definite and accurate opinions regarding our schools.

Preliminary to the presentation of statistics and other
matter which may imply criticism, desire to record my many
favorable impressions received during the past few months
in visits to schools. There are few cities in whose public
schools are to be found larger percentage of clean, attracttive looking children. Evidences of care in the home are
abundant, and the neatness of school buildings and yards
testify to the practical training which the children are receiving in those habits which make for civic health and
beauty. Holyoke’s teachers are for the most part conscientious, earnest, and sympathetic, eager for suggestions and
quick to put such suggestions into practice in their teaching. The school buildings are with few exceptions credit
to the city and compare favorably with those in other cities
of Massachusetts. The fine collections of pictures and
statuary, and the specimens of natural history in some buildings reveal an interest and pride in’ the schools which
are highly complimentary to any community. These are *
some of the happy and pleasing impressions which convey
unconsciously the feeling that the attitude of Holyoke

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
citizens and Holyoke teachers toward the public schoo’s is
one of deep interest, helpfulness and loyalty.

Expenditures

The money spent for the support or maintenance of
the schools is spent by two different departments of the
city government. Permanent repairs on buildings, and
heating, lighting and janitor service are looked after by ;
the Board of Public Works; while the work of equipping
buildings with furniture and keeping such furniture in repair, as well as providing teachers and educational supplies,
is done by the School Department. The following table
gives somewhat detailed account of the expenditures by
the School Department.

From the above it will be seen that the expenditure of
over  of the public funds is intrusted to the officers
of the School Department. The wise and economical use
of this money depends almost wholly upon the honesty,
intelligence and conscientious purpose of the School Committee
and Superintendent. It is grave responsibility calling for
an intimate knowledge of school organization and rigid
application of sound business principles. It is easily possible
in handling such large school system to spend unwisely
several thousand dollars year without spending dollar
dishonestly.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE. OI
Among the larger items of expenditure are to be found
furniture, text books, educational supplies, and teachers’
salaries. The following figures show the annual expenditure
for the last three items since  :—
Text Books and
Educational Supplies Furniture
          ,   .  
As it costs between  and  to fit up one
room with furniture for children and teacher, and as worn
out furniture is being continually discarded and replaced by
new, the yearly expenditures seem moderate. In the
expenditure for text books and educational supplies there
has been an increase of about one-third in recent years, the
average for the past four years exding that for the preceding four years by or by per cent. Presumably this is due in part to growth in school membership.
The expenditure for day school teachers, excluding
superintendent and supervisors, amounts to ,
or per cent of the total. Below is comparison of this
expenditure with that of former years:—  $               

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
: As is evident from the foregoing, this item of school |
expenditure has increased rapidly in recent years, partly
because of the increase in salaries and partly because of the
increase in the number of teachers employed. In view of
the amount spent and of the rapid increase, it has seemed to ,
me advisable to examine into this expenditure carefully in
order that we may shape our future -policy wisely.
Assuming that the salaries paid to Holyoke’s teachers
are not excessive, the only pther way in which our expendi- :
ture for teachers can be unwise or excessive is by employing |
a larger number in proportion to the number of pupils than
the city can afford. Does this condition prevail in Holyoke
today?
In examining this question it is necessary to make a
careful study of the organization and membership of the
schools; and the High School, the grades, and the kindergarten must be considered separately as the usual number of
pupils per teacher differs greatly in these different parts of
our school system.

today is somewhat larger than jt was few years ago, but
the school is also much larger. It is interesting to note the
Steady and consistent growth of this school in recent years;
a growth which testifies not merely to the increasing population of the city but to the growing ambition on the part
of our young men and women to reach higher plain of
intelligence and usefulness, and to the improving economic
conditions in the home. The introduction and development
of new lines of work,—like commercial, technical and domestic courses and athletics,—in the curricula of our high
schools throughout the country has tendency to increase
the ratio of the number of teachers to the number of pupils.
This has probably been true of our own school, but considering the enrollment and the courses offered, the number
of teachers seems reasonably small and has apparently
only kept pace with the natural growth of the school. Below is table showing the growth of the High School during
the past ten years.

As each Kindergarten class is in charge of two teachers |
and only one class is !ocated in any one building, it is impossible to regulate the number of teachers by the number of children. The classes average at present about thirty-five with
two teachers in charge of each. The percentage of growth in

From these comparisons it  evident that Holyoke is
employing larger number of grade teachers in proportion )
to the school membership than is true of many other cities. |
Whether we are employing larger number than the city
can afford with due regard to economy and the varied and
broadening needs of the schools is question for your Com- |
mittee to decide. |
Another view of the question is obtained by an examina- :
tion of the present classification of pupils. As the schools ,
are now organized some of the classes are needlessly small, |
others are much too large. In some cases of course the |
classes are small simply because of the very limited seating
capacity of the rooms, but in other cases it would seem that !
a desire to avoid having two grades under single teacher |
is given undue weight in classification. As rule the large |
classes exist only because of crowded conditions in the school |
or district. On November of the classes in the |
grades, not including the Smiths Ferry School, numbered
  pupils or less,  of these having less than pupils);  
numbered over pupils; while classes had between
  and pupils each. The following lists, which include
the mixed schools at Ingleside and West Holvoke, give a
definite idea of the size of classes on that date. Several of
the larger classes are cared for by two teachers.

the schools for few months. Besides, we had the teachers,
and any hasty changes looking to the consolidation
of the small classes would not have reduced materially
the immediate financial outlay. More careful planning,
however, another year ought to result in fewer very small
classes and in smaller number of very large ones, and
possibly in fuller utilization of present school accommodations. |

The number of pupils per teacher  smaller in Holyoke than the average size of classes for the reason that there

|
|
  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
are often used for the teaching of special subjects rather
than for the teaching of special children. Individual teaching,
or small group teaching, is necessary for some children
who are backward and deficient. If such children could be
separated entirely from the others and formed into special
classes, and each class given its own room where regularly
assigned teachers might be held responsible for giving the
special attention required, the results would be better. Several
such classes ought to be formed. We have such children,
but there are no spare rooms. In the meantime, it would
seem wise to assign most of these spare teachers to regular
classes as vacancies occur.
In this discussion do not want to be understood as
favoring large classes in the grades. am simply making
a careful and thorough study along this line for the purpose of determining, if possible, what constitutes fair average sized class for Holyoke, and adopting such policy as
scems to be compatible with efficiency in the work. In
nearly all of our New England cities the large proportion
of children who come from homes where English is seldom
spoken makes the work of the grade teacher particularly
difficult, but in Holyoke the parochial schools take care of
very large numbers of these children, and our difficulties
of this kind are probably no greater than is true in other
cities of Massachusetts in which the number of teachers
is smaller relatively than here. Nobody questions the
desirability of having small classes. If Holvoke could afford
a teacher for every twenty-five pupils, should strongly
advise it. But it is not unreasonable, it seems to me, toraise
the question whether Holyoke has not gone farther in this
direction than wecan afford. Small classes and extra teachers
for the grades are desirable, but many other things also are |
desirable, and wise balance in expenditures must be maintained,
Neither do want to be understood as favoring reduction in the expenditure for schools. Holyoke will spend

spend more money on schools when convinced that the results become greater in proportion to the additional outlay.
‘But they must be sure that this is so. believe that we
could do as good work as we are now doing in this city in
the grades with smaller number of teachers. The salary
of one teacher thus saved would fully equip manual training room in grammar school building, or furnish one hundred growing children with suitable up-to-date furniture,
or supply over two thousand books of new, fresh reading
material, or increase our equipment in the High School by ten
new lathes, or pay for an additional industrial course in the
evening High School. There are innumerable needs to which
money thus saved might be applied. New lines of deve!opment in the nature of practical courses, much more expensive
than the book courses of the past, are opening up before the
public schools of the country. The cities and towns of Massachusetts are feeling this new impulse in education and are
responding strongly inthe establishment of technical and trade
schools. Holyoke has felt this impulse and has made beginn
ing in some of these lines,—others remain undeveloped. A
look into thefuture of our school system shows its field of influence changing and broadening to make it more closely responsive to the needs of our people, and this broadening of the scope
of the public school work will be evervwhere accompanied
by increasing expenditures. The use of common sense in
the application of school appropriations to rapidly changing
school systems is more urgently needed today than ever
before in this country. do not suggest reduction in the
amount spent on schools, but would recommend that the
appropriation be applied more broadly.
This frank discussion of expenditures for teachers Is
presented not in spirit of criticism, but in the belief that,
in this department, economy, which ts nothing more than
spending the city’s money carefully and wisely, is depend, ent largely upon thorough and exact knowledge of just |
such questions. ;

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
Evening Schools }
The average nightly attendance at the Evening High
School for the past year was  while that for all other
evening schools was  The High School was open ninety-nine evenings, the Appleton Street Grammar ninety-one,
while the Morgan, West Street, North Chestnut Street and
Springdale Schools were each open forty evenings. Many
of the pupils of the four last named schools were compelled
by state law to go to evening school. new law which became
operative at the opening of these schools few months ago
may affect radically the attendance for the present year.
This: law compels the attendance at evening schools
only of those between sixteen and eighteen years of age who |
cannot read and write English. Under the old law, which
had been in effect for number of years, attendance was re- |
quired of illiterates between sixteen and twenty-one. The
old law covered period of five years; the new law only two. |
This ought to reduce the number of those who are compelled
to attend evening schools by fully one-half. Up to the present time, however, this reduction has not been very noticeable, the total attendance at the elementary evening |
schools slightly exding that of last year. The fact that,
under the new law, these schools have maintained nightly
attendance equal to or above that of last year indicates
that larger number of pupils are attending voluntarily
than heretofore. This may be due in part to the important
changes which have been made in these schools recently.
They are now in charge of day school principals and
are being taught in part by day school teachers. Grammar
departments have been started at the Morgan and West
Street buildings which, tt is hoped, will become well established in the course of year or two. The schools are well
organized, and for future development we should look to
more skillful teaching, more carefully planned courses, and
a larger supply of more suitable books. In past years these
schools have been closed early in January at the end of the

fortieth night. It is planned this year by the Evening
School Committee to keep them open until March  th. This
will cost several thousand dollars more, but the importance
of the work is such that the plan ought to be approved.

In referring to those who are compelled under the laws
of Massachusetts to attend evening school, it might be well
to mention here that certificates have been issued to over
g  minors during the past year at the school office. The
standard for testing these minors has been raised gradually
during the last few months to more nearly conform to the
State law, which reads as follows:

“The ability to read at sight and to write legibly simple

sentences in the English language shall be construed as meaning such ability to read and write as is required for admission
to the fourth grade of the public schools of the city or town
in which such minor lives.’ (Acts of  Chapter  ,
Section  .)
Children who cannot satisfy in this test and who are under
sixteen are compelled to attend day school; those between
sixteen and eightcen are allowed to work but they must attend evening school regularly.

The Evening High School had an average nightly attendance during October of  and of during November. This is somewhat larger than last year. Those who
have been instrumental in the development of this school
need only watch its growth to feel that their efforts have been
successful and are appreciated. It ts an excellent school,
the work in most of the classes being of high order.
It is interesting to note that the most attractive courses,
judged by the attendance, are those which give practical
training, such as bookkeeping, typewriting, mechanical
drawing, and steam engineering. This is true of evening
high schools in general, and their growth has been largely
in proportion to the number of practical courses offered.

| REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
Other Conditions in Day Schools
During the past few months have spent much time
in the class rooms watching the actual work of the teachers
as could be spared for this purpose. Genuine interest in
the work, deep love for and sympathy with children, good
knowledge of subject matter, skill and power in leading children to observe, think and express, are not found in every class
room. Some weak, ineffective teaching is being done, in
some cases by teachers who will respond quickly to supervision and aid; but work of high grade is more common.
Skillful teachers are not rare in Holyoke. However
severe the criticism or undeserved the praise asregardsa city
school system, the average teacher must not be lost sight of |
as factor in maintaining the stability and general effect- |
iveness of the work. Schools are seldom as good or as poor |
as they are painted. |
In the central section of the city the work is somewhat
hampered by overcrowded conditions. This is true particularly in the Appleton Street School where two small classes
of third and fourth grade children are occupying one room
and another class of eighth and ninth grade children recently transferred from the North Chestnut Street School
are being accommodated in the hall on the third floor. In
the North Chestnut Street School there is an over-crowded
condition in the primary classes. As the rooms at the Elm
Street and South Chestnut Street Schools are occupied with
the exception of poorly lighted room on the third floor of
the last named building, it seems impossible to better these
conditions for the present. In two other growing sections
of the city, Elmwood and West Street districts, the buildings are fully occupied and additional rooms will probably
be needed in the near future.
All of the children in the public schools today are housed
in the regular school buildings, no outside rooms being used.
The policy of using these outside rooms, while it may have been
necessary in the past, is not only expensive but decidedly

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE. TO 
dangerous to the health of children and teachers. Such
rooms, used in different parts of the city in past years, however
well adapted for store purposes, were never intended for
schoolrooms and were probably in all cases entirely unfit
from the standpoint of light and ventilation. city’s right
to compel attendance under such conditions may well be
questioned; the fact that neither teachers nor children are
likely to protest does not lessen the responsibility.
It is surprising that Holyoke, recognized leader in
the movements which make for civic and social betterment,
has neglected thus far to install shower baths in such buildings as the Morgan, Hamilton Street or West Street Schools.
Such baths in other citics have proved serviceable and have
been well patronized not only on school days but on Saturdays. The expense would be trifling compared with the
wholesome and wide spread results. This is one of the best
ways in which school building may serve the larger needs
of community.
Appointment of Teachers
It has been stated many times in former reports that the
character and worth of school depend primarily upon
the character, personality and skill of the teacher. This
thought, coupled with desire to see it worked out in practice, found expression last spring in the new rule giving the
Superintendent the sole power to appoint teachers. This rule
carries with it heavy responsibility. No man's judgment
is infallible and some appointed teachers will fail to measure up to expectations. It  essential, however, that certain guiding principles be followed in the selection of teachers
if the schools are to be benefited by the new rule. Teachers
should be selected because of ability and fitness only. The public schools exist for the purpose of providing children the op- |
portunity for growth, not for the purpose of providing anybody with position. Every child in the public school
|
!

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

has right to the best teaching that can be furnished for the
money available, and this right of the child should outweigh
every other consideration and influence in the selection of
teachers. Rigid adherance to these ideas is essential if
helpless children are to be protected in this right and if the
school is to fulfill its mission.

Few institutions in the history of civilization have
done work of such importance as that being done today by
the public school. Its growth and development are but
expressions of the people’s desire to fit their children for
better service to society and to give them broader outlook
upon life. In this country it  the chief agency in harmonizing and amalgamating the diverse races of which our population is composed; it is the true social center of democracy
where distinctions of race and creed are obliterated and
where the future men and women of America are measuring
themselves by their fellows and learning to value character
above art ficial rank, and to know and confide in real nobility. Our cities, especially our New England cities, need,
socially and politically, the transforming touch of public
schools, the free commingling of children from many homes,
the fashioning of ideals of civic honesty and public service.
This ts the work in which we are engaged,—a work requiring
service of the highest type, intelligent, unselfish, patriotic,
—a work which is closely related to the salvation of the city
and the welfare of the nation.

REPORT OF THE
Supervisor of Music.
Mr. J. L. Riley, Superintendent of Schools.

Dear Sik:—The year just passed has been very fruitful year in the musical department of the grammar schools.
The work has been carried on in the same manner as in previous
years, and the same efficient work has been done by the teachers. The appointment of an assistant has enabled me to give
more time to grammar grades and high school.

The graduation exercises last June were very successful,
the several classes singing class song of music of high order,
in manner that brought forth comments of praise from the
parents. The combined classes sang several selections.

It is very gratifying to me, to be able to report, that at the
High School this year we have the largest class in chorus
work in the history of the school. We have about taking
music in the school, showing that the pupils appreciate the opportunity offered them. have organized an orchestra, which
I hope will be source of instruction as well as pleasure to
the whole school. They have played on several occasions in
a very satisfactory manner. ,

Beginning with the fall term, new schedule was put into
operation, which allowed me more time at the High School,
and which was used to good advantage. The orchestra, girls’
glee club, and boys’ glee club were organized at this time,
which will be heard from later.

I wish to express my thanks to the principals and teachers
of the schools, for their co-operation, to the Superintendent
for his courtesy on many occasions and to the School Committee for their liberality.

Yours respectfully,
HUGH CRAIG.

REPORT OF THE
Supervisor of Drawing.

Mr. John L. Riley, Superintendent of Schools.

DEAR r:—The work in drawing has followed nearly
the same lines during the past year as for several preceding
years. An effort has been made to correlate the subject, as
much as possible, with other school work and particularly to
make the work in design as practical as possible by giving
problems that actually occur in the home and school.

Near the end of the school year, every pupil in the primary
and grammar grades was required to construct, and design the
decoration for some useful article. Book covers, portfolios,
bags, holders, sofa-cushions and lamp shades were among the
objects constructed, and, in many cases, the resu ts secured
were surprisingly good.

The successful construction and decoration of these objects, however, was of less importance than the knowledge
gained by the pupil that he was able to mect the limitations
and conditions required in design planned for particular
object, and applied to that object when he had himself constructed it. The ability to plan and execute work from start to !
finish cannot fail to prove valuable in any position in life.

If all of our design work could be applied design its value |
would be more highly appreciated, but the constructive work, |
to which the decorative design can be applied ts really ‘Manual
Training” for which no time is allowed below Grade IX. It  s
greatly to be hoped that, sometime in the future, some allowance will be made for such work.

The programs of Mrs. Dougherty and Miss Lynn provide
for visit, once in two weeks, to every primary and grammar

|

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
school in the city. These frequent visits enable them to keep
in close touch with the pupils and teachers and excellent work
is being done.

It has been made possible, by the appointment of second
assistant in drawing last year, for me to devote more time to
the High School Art Department, and this is proving to be of
great advantage because pupils can be kept to much greater
degree in regular classes.

Water-color painting has always been strong feature of
the High School work, but the study of design also occupies
a prominent place. Pupils are encouraged to plan designs for
a great variety of articles in which they may be interested.
Last year many beautiful pieces of leather work were executed
and it is hoped that, this year, some metal work may be done,
which possibly has more permanent value than anything
that we have before attempted.

The subject of drawing is taught in the Holyoke Schools
under favorable conditions and the School Board has right
to expect that good results will be obtained. Our record has
been good in the past, but with the increased number of supervisors we shall endeavor to make it better in the future.

Thanking all whose co-operation has aided this department,

Respectfully yours,
ISABELLE H. FERRY.

REPORT OF THE
 ee
, Supervisor of Whiting.
Mr. John L. Riley, Superintendent of Schools.

DEAR Sir:—In city constituted like Holyoke, where
many of the pupils in our schools are obliged to leave at an
early age to enter the army of wage earners, it is essential that
they receive every equipment necessary to help them in the
struggle for existence. Hence the study of Writing is an important and valuable one to the child. The work in this department for the past year has been along lines similar to the
preceding one, Spencer’s Slant System of Practical Writing
being used. Beginning in the primaries with the study of form
and elementary movement, we have worked upward through
the grades, until clear, legible writing, suitable for business
purposes, has been attained. As great part of the pupil’s
school life is spent in writing, it  necessary that the manner |
of execution be free and unrestrained. To secure this special
movement work has been given at each lesson. The method
employed in teaching these exercises is that used in the best
business colleges throughout the country. To insure’ uniformity of speed, counting has been used to good effect. Besides inspection of the writ ng books, the general work tn spelling
and language has been carefully reviewed, with the idea of
further perfection. Beheving with Ruskin that, “A beautiful
thought well expressed but written in an unworthy manner
loses half its charm,” we have endeavored to have the writing
in the compositions worthy of the thought, and the beautiful
work shown in the Thanksgiving stories, has been source of
pleasure to all. Teachers mectings have been started in th’s

department, and will continue to be given throughout the
year. The teachers have expressed themselves as pleased with
these meetings, and that they are helpful and productive of
good results.

In closing, allow me to extend my thanks to the Superin tendent, principals, and teachers, for their generous co-opertion.
Very truly yours,
ESTHER A. MacDONNELL.

REPORT OF THE.

 .

Pnincipal of the High School.
Mr. John L. Riley, Superintendent of Schools, Holyoke, Mass.

Dear Sir:—In accordance with custom, herewith send
you the principal’s report for the school year ending November
  Asa matter of fact, am writing you this report some
time later than this date, and some of the things therein incorporated may include matters up to January My last
general report had facts in it dealing with school work in  
and the early part of rgog. will not, therefore, repeat
matters contained in my first report which might have been
more properly included in this report to you.

Three vears ago, semi-annual examinations were introduced in this school to take the place of bi-monthly examinations. It was thought that examinations covering the brief
period of work were not of quite the same value as those of a
more formal nature and covering, at least, one-half year’s

 work. These examinations occur the latter part of January and
June. Asa result of these examinations, the schedule of classes
is somewhat changed and the teacher's work, in some instances, Is rearranged. The examinations are entered tnto seriously
by the pupils and beheve they have decided educational
value. They prepare students better to take civil service examinations, or college entrance examinations, or whatever
written tests are required to determine efficiency. The examInations in themselves are not, however, of chief importance .
in the scholar’s advancement. Two-thirds of the mark of any
particular student is based upon the class or daily work,
and one-third upon the semi-annual examination.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  

I believe it to be the teacher's first duty to endeavor by
skillful methods and clear presentation of subject matter to
interest the scholars in their studies. When this interest is
aroused, it is not so difficult to secure from the part of the pupil
proper amount of outside preparation, or intelligent and acceptable recitation in the class-room. In addition to the interest that the teacher should arouse, it is important to bring
to bear influences that will encourage and aid the students in
preparing their lessons.

Last spring plan was tried and found to work quite successfully. It has been continued so far during the present year;
that is, where the scholar has failed to prepare his lessons properly, and where it seems to be mainly from lack of time spent
in preparing the subject, the scholars are asked to return to the
high school building in the afternoon, the first four days of the
week, where special room ts provided with teacher in charge,
whose duty it is to see that the scholars devote the time preparing the lessons they have previously failed in. This plan,
of course, depends upon the teachers insisting upon the penalty
being enforced if the recitation is not properly prepared.

The fund from the lecture course has been partially used
for the purchase of stereopticon slides, three sets having been
purchased, one on Forestry, one on Shakespeare and Shakespeare’s country, and oncon Italy and Gre. These are to be
used from time to time for the different classes as part of the
Visual instruction in the High School. Also some of the fund
has been used to purchase instruments for the school orchestra.
These instruments are to be the property of the school, and are
to be returned by the pupil using them when he Icaves school.
The lecture course for this vear will consist of three ShakesPeare readings by Marshall Darrach, reading of Dicken’s

 “The Cricket on the Hearth,” by George Kiernan, lecture
by John Kendrick Bangs, and lecture by Judge Ben B.
Lindsey.

Two meetings of parents have been held so far this vear,
One on regular parents’ day in October, and one later in the year,
with the parents of college preparatory students of the third

Il  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE. |

and fourth years who were requested to meet the heads of the

departments for discussion and mutual suggestions as to college

preparatory subjects and methods. large number of parents

attended these meetings and it is hoped good results will accrue.

Some change in equipment and arrangement of rooms
has been made in the high school, the main one being the placing
of the heavy machinery and lathes of the manual training department in the basement room below the regular manual training
room, and the cutting of stairway connecting the two rooms.
This removes all vibration from the regular class rooms
which has been source of serious annoyance and had made
one good corner class-room practically useless. The work also
in manual training can be carried on with better advantage
when the teacher is supervising but one kind of work at time.
As it is now, the lathe work occupies distinct hours from the
bench work. The placing of the manual training in the ninth
grade already shows better results in the ability of the high
school students, and the course as now outlined is systematic
one; the models are arranged so that one follows the other in
line of proper steps of advancement. The latter part of the
year is devoted mainly to the making of useful articles of furniture of somewhat pretentious character.

In the art department, more work of useful nature has
been undertaken, and more time has been spent producing
articles of value. This work has been very largely confined to
articles of leather and brass. It is now planned to go step farther and apply the orginal designs to hammered and enameled
models. The scholars show great interest in this phase of work
and it is of nature that should be encouraged.

The sewing room was placed in more commodious quarters,
being moved from the second floor to large room on the third
floor. The chance is now given for larger sections and for better
supervision by the teacher. Both in this subject and in cooking,
I beheve that many more of our girls should be interested.
They are practical subjects and no girl in the high school who
studies here any length of time should leave without some
practical and definite knowledge of these two branches. The

|

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
cooking courses are somewhat changed from last year, in that
an advanced course is offered which includes some work in the
chemistry of foods, and somewhat scientific knowledge of
housekeeping, diatetics, heating, ventilating, and all that
which pertains to household economics. One period week
at least is spent in prepared work, and an extra cred is allowed
in this course in excess of that of the first year’s work. Visits
of this class are to be made to the plumbing establishments of
the city, while the sewing class intend to visit the cotton
mills of the city, and more scientific study of the fabrics which
enter into the cloths used is to be made.

The classes and societies of the schools have, according to
custom, presented to the school several pictures of unusual
merit; these have been placed in the corridors and different
rooms of the building, adding to the already large collection
given on previous occasions of this kind. The pictures presented
this year are as follows:

From the Assembly, Sir Isaac Newton (A Photograph)

From the Class of  “Old Faithful.’ (A Photograph)

From the “Q” Club, Cloisters of the Alhambra (A Braun

Photograph).

From the Dramatic Club, “Castle of the Maidens.”

From the Herald, Photograph, “The Departure.”

From Phi Alpha, Photograph, ‘The Oath.” |

The plan for teaching music in the school has been quiet
material changed from last year; the regular music classes
are about the same, but on Friday morning, the musical director
meets the orchestra, the boys’ glee club and the girls’ glee club.
These clubs are making good advancement and one credit for
unprepared work ts allowed to pupils who are taking the subject regularly and doing conscientious work. There is no element that can be used to so good an advantage in large high
school as that of music properly conducted, and entered into
with the right spirit by the pupils.

The school is represented in athletics by the same number
of teams with the add tion of hockey team, which ts sport
that should be encouraged, as It is in so many ways preferable

to an indoor game. The park department of the city has
flooded large space on the grounds known as the Range near
the high school building which is used for practice and games.
This Range is also devoted to high school field sports. suggestion has been made to change the direction of the Beach
Street Extension so that the grounds may be better used for |
baseball. Dr. Gulick in an address here last spring, spoke |
favorably of the practicability and advisability of this change. |
As it is, the center and right fie!ds are in or across the roadway
from the diamond, and it makes it impossible to have the field
in good playing condition when outside teams are entertained
here. Our reputation as school is based somewhat upon the
opinion that the members of visiting teams take away with
them to their own schools. Unless this change can be made,
in my opinion, it is not advisable to continue using these grounds,
especially for regular baseball games. While the high school
does not exist for athletics, athletics, to certain extent, exist |
for the high school, and believe that every boy physically able
should be encouraged to take decided interest in athletic
sports. scholar can do this without interfering with his
studies, he pays some little attention to planning his time,
and student with physical endurance should be that much
more efficient in his studies. To aid in developing well| rounded character, morally, mentally, and physically, is the
function of the school, and where proper gymnasium conditions |
and suitable athletic field are part of the physical equipment |
of our high school, so much better should the bovs and  girls |
be prepared to meet the conditions in life as they will find }
them after leaving the high school. ,

This was decided increase over the large class that graduated '

larger than that of last vear. Of this number, fourteen returned
to take postgraduate work either in the general courses, commercial branches, or college preparatory subjects. Fifteen

of the class of who returned for special work, eight entered
college in the fall of rgog, three entered Normal schools, and
two special schools. The total of those entering college or
technical schools is twenty-three, Normal schools, eleven, and
special schools seven. The nine students of the class of  
having the highest standings, are given below with the subject
of their orations:

Gladys Emma Bailey, “The Lure of the Woods’; Mary
K. Magdalene Buckley, “The Tragedy of Macbeth’; Timothy
Francis Moriarty, “Thomas Alva Edison,”; Anna Margaret
Gear, “A History of Girls in the High School’; James Raymond
Malony, “The Growth of Holyoke’; May Eloise O’Connor,
“Story Telling’; George Richter, ‘Industrial Education”;
Ruth Hubbard, ‘‘What Shall We Do with the Children?”; Alice
Edith Browne, “Mendelssohn’s Midsummer Night’s Dream.”
The Oration of James Raymond Malony was of particular
interest in that the slides which he gave were prepared by

| himself, many of them photographs of views in Holyoke.

As result of the speaking contest of the boys held in this
school in March, Walter Nye of the class of Ig  was selected
by the judges to represent our school at the interscholastic
contest held in Syracuse, under the auspices of Syracuse University.

The Civic Improvement League awarded one of their
prize banners to the high school. The committee awarded
this prize for the well-kept grounds, flower beds and shrubbery
surrounding the high school bunding.

Fire gongs were instal’‘ed by the Board of Public Works;
two are located on each floor, one in the manual training
room and one in the gymnasium. Whenever these bells are
rung, it is signal for the fire drill and without crowding,
our school of over pupils can vacate the building in about
one minute and thirty seconds.

Some changes occurred in the faculty during the past year.
Miss Mary O'Ilaherty who for many years was at the head of
the classical department, resigned to accept simular position
in the Hartford public school. Miss Adele Allen, who had

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

been at the head of the history department, was chosen as Miss
O’Flaherty’s successor in the classical department. Mr. S.
Adino Wood, who was at the head of the commercial department
resigned at the opening of school in the fall, and was replaced
by Mr. George H. Dalrymple of the State Educational Department at Albany, graduate of the University of Vermont,
and man of considerable expericnce in school work. Mr.
John J. Curran was appointed teacher of History and Latin.
Mr. George B. Downing resigned October  to accept position
in the Boys’ High School in Brooklyn. His place was filled
by Miss Alice Brown, graduate of Mount Holyoke College.

The withdrawals in the school so far for the year  
number  The reasons assigned for leaving school as far as
we have been able to determine are as follows: to go to work;
 removed from city; to enter business schools; to enter
other preparatory schools; to enter Mt. Holyoke College;
  change in plans; death in family; illness; dismissed;
  “did not like school”; discouraged in studies, and no
reason given. No doubt out of the twenty-two who went
to work, number were doing very poor work and were dissatisfied with school, or the parents removed them from school,
thinking the pupil was not getting enough benefit from the
school to warrant parent in continuing his child in school
when an opportunity came for suitable employment. The
three who entered other preparatory schools and the one who
gives for reason change in plans, were postgraduate students.
In many of the cases of withdrawals, teachers visited the homes
and endeavored to have the pupil return; but once boy or
girl has started to work, it is difficult to arouse their interest
again in school studies. :

The school which has to do with the adolescent age, should,
in its activities, represent in way the problems of adult life.
Such school should not be en irely concerned with preparing
for life, but be so organized and governed as to represent life
itself. The qualities of mind, heart and body which make the
good citizen should be the same as those that go to make up :
the good scholar.

REPORT OF THE
Pp e
rincipal of the Evening
|

High School. |
Mr. John L. Riley, Superintendent of Schools. .
DEAR SIR:—The work of this school during the past year
has been such as to arouse more interest on the part of the
public, and the large enrolment for the present term is good
evidence that our citizens are beginning to realize that the
school is live institution and worthy of greater attention.
Since the beginning of the present term an entirely new system of enrolment and registration has been inaugurated by
reason of which the enrolment of pupils is greatly facilitated,
the records and data more casily accessible and the school
property and supplies accurately inventoried and classified.
It was found necessary carly in the term to open an additional room to accommodate the large number in the
French department and this has proved to be one of the most
popular courses of the school.
This vear’s enrolment in) our commercial department
is the largest in its history, boys and girls. The work
of the department has alwavs been of high order and the
classes in bookkeeping particularly have maintained splendid record of attendance and scholarship.
The class in steam engineering Which proved so popular
last year to the men of the city has been conducted with similar success this vear. Over one hundred men have enrolled
and the work of the course has been classified so as to cover

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE,  ]
a period of three years. There are three classes, graded according to qualifications of pupils, viz:—beginners, licensed
hremen, and steam engineers. Each class meets one evening week and  in charge of lecturer and teacher with
practical experience. Through the courtesy of Mr. Reardon
of the School Board the apparatus in the demonstrating room
has been augmented by the loan of two steam engines. The
other classes of the school have attracted many pupils and
are doing very satisfactory work.

There is an excellent spirit among our pupils and the
smoothness with which the work moves forward, the vim,
energy and real zest with which the pupils enter into their
studies is revelation to the visitor. It is with view towards encouraging this spirit that series of school meetings
were planned for the present term, the first of which was
recently held and addresses made by the Mayor and Superintendent of Schools. At each of these mectings some well
known speaker will be invited to address the school and the
pupils provide short musical and literary entertainment.

In view of the fact that large percentage of the total
enrolment is made up of pupils entering the commercial and
mechanical departments of the school would recommend
that additional courses along these lines be opened. Naturally such additional classes would mean considerable increase in expense of equipment and supplies as well as addttional teachers, but these are practical courses and appeal
strongly to large number of men who are not interested
in acedemic subjects, but nevertheless are anxious to receive
instruction in trades and crafts. We ought also do something
for our young girls by conducting courses in plain sewing,
dressmaking or millinery. This could be provided for by
opening the domestic science room for the use of evening
classes.

The school should be provided with complete set of
text books for the use of the pupils. Since the opening of the
school we have been handicapped by not having text books
for all classes, and we have been forced to borrow from the

I  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
day high school to supply our needs. This has resulted in
more or less inconvenience and confusion for it forces our
pupils in many instances to use old, worn out and discarded
books and this is somewhat discouraging. It is hoped
that another year will see this condition remedied.

growth of the school during the past three years.

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

During the school year eleven summonses were served
on boys for truancy and brought before the court, five were
committed to the Training School, six were placed on probation and their cases were continued from time to time and
finally discharged. There were five boys paroled on the
recommendation of the superintendent of the Training
School, having received the required number of merits for
good behavior and efficiency in their studies. The parents of
some of the boys have left the city, and those who are here
are attending school regularly. We have at the present time
six boys at the Training School.

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE. |
Beginning January the examination or test in
reading and writing that is required of minors between fourteen and sixteen years of age before they can receive an age
and schooling certificate was made such as Is given to |
children entering the fourth grade of the public schools.
There were nine hundred and ten age and schooling
certificates issued to minors between the above ages from
September I,  to September I,  gain of four
hundred and twelve over the previous year.
We also issued five hundred and eight minor employment
certificates to minors over sixteen years of age certifying that
they were able to read and write sentences in the English
language.
In the month of December all of the manufacturing and
mercantile establishments in the city were visited as  s
required by the statute, to see if the law relating to the
employment of minors was complied with —that all minors
between the ages of fourteen and sixteen had age and schooling
certificates and that none were employed without the same
and also that the illiterate minors over sixteen and under
eighteen years were attending the public evening school
as the law requires. It was found that none were employed
without the age and schooling certificate, that the attendance
of the illiterate minors at evening school was excellent,
according to the records kept by the overseers, and that the
overseers Were strictly complying with the minor employment
laws.
Respectfully submitted, ,
: T. W. DOYLE,
| Chief Truant Officer.
|
|

To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen of the
City of Holyoke:

GENTLEMEN:

We have the honor to submit herewith for your consideration the annual report of the Health Department,
including such suggestions and recommendations as are
deemed of interest to the public.

ORGANIZATION.

The Board met February and elected the following officers:

A. B. Wetherell, M. D. Chairman

F. A. Woods, M. D., Secretary

J. J. Carroll, M. D., was elected Bacteriologist.

PUBLIC HEALTH.

Great improvement will be noted in Health matters
during the past year and statistics show the general health
of the city to be much better than formerly. We appreciate
the fact that good share of the credit for this satisfactory
condition is due to the good work of other departments and
charitable organizations.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
DIPHTHERIA.

The past year has been one of the lightest for several
years. All cases reported have been quarantined.  Antitoxin was furnished free to all who applied through their
family physicians. Culture tubes are supplied and  specimens are examined without charge. |

SCARLET FEVER.

There have been few less cases than last year. All
cases were quarantined and fumigated with Formaldehyde
compound. .

WHOOPING COUGH

While there were but few cases reported, the disease
was prevalent throughout the city. It is disease that causes much suffering and was fatal in five cases. Parents
should not be indifferent and allow their children to be
necdlessly exposed, for the old idea that children must contract these diseases sooner or later is erroneous.

TYPHOID FEVER. |

Eighteen cases of Typhoid Fever were reported
during the past year. Most of the cases reported were out
of town patients who were taken to our local Hospitals for
treatment. Investigation eliminated the water and milk
supplies in every case, so that there is no need for public
concern.

TUBERCULOSIS.

Weare only at the beginning of our fight against this disease.

Much remains to be done by the city. Practically everyA

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
thing up to the present time has been accomplished by citizens banded together in organization. By them, the public
has been educated concerning the cause, care and prevention of Tuberculosis and money has been obtained from
citizens of the city and state for the establishment and mainnance of hospitas for tubercular patients.

The educational work is excellent and good results are
being accomplished, but the real work must be in the homes
of the sick. There is where the city must spend money to
obtain lasting results.

ISOLATION HOSPITAL.

The Members of the Health Department desire to express their appreciation of the interest His Honor, the Mayor
and the Board of Aldermen have taken in the purchase of:
a site for the contageous disease hospital. This is the first
step toward the erection of the institution and the Board
earnestly recommend that immediate steps be taken for
such an appropriation as will allow the erection of few
buildings at least during the coming year.

Such an institution will be indispensable should an
epidemic of either Diphtheria or Scarlet Fever break out
in our tenement districts and would not only aid the Board
in coping with such an outbreak but would doubtless be the
means of saving the lives of many children who would be
effected by such an epidemic.

MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS

There is no question that the Medical Inspection of
schools has accomplished vast amount of good during
the short time that it has been in vogue in this city, but there
is plenty of room for improvement. The greater cleanliness of the children, the greater freedom from Pediculosis,
the larger number of operations for Adenoids and enlarged

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH. |
tonsils. eye examinations and growing appreciation of the |
importance of caring for the teeth assures us the results of
Medical Inspection of schools are better year from to year.
BARBER SHOPS.
The barber shops have been thoroughly inspected and
rules and regulations posted in each. Five shops were found
not complying with the rules of the board and upon being
notified, made the required changes.
BAKERIES. |
| All bakeries have been inspected and rules and regu- |
lations posted in each. Three were found not complying
with the law and were notified to put their aces in sanitary condition.
UNDERTAKERS.
Twelve licenses have been granted to engage in
this business during the year.
NUISANCES.
Many complaints of nuisances are received at the office
from citizens and some from the police. All of these receive
prompt attention whether anonymous or not. Quite a
number proved to be unfounded and are due to quarrels
between neighbors or between tenants and landlords. In
most instances, however, real nutsances are found.
INSPECTION OF MEAT AND PROVISIONS.
The greater part of the Inspector's duties is the inspection of provisions and meats and the most important. of
these duties is the inspection of carcasses slaughtered for
human food. It is the duty of the Inspector to inspect
all said carcasses and if in his judgment they are free from

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
disease and fit for human food they are to be branded as
provided for in Section of Chapter  Acts of  .
All carcasses not so branded shall be deemed unfit for food
and shall not be sold nor offered for sale.

John M. Carlon was appointed Inspector of Meat and
Provisions, July and since that time has performed
the following duties:

Total inspections, stores and markets,

MILK SUPPLY. ,
In May and June we received from the State Board of
Health list of farms in and around Holyoke which had been
inspected by an agent of said State Board of Health and in
which conditions were found which were not in keeping with

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
the production of pure nor clean milk. Said milk to be sold
in Holyoke. Letters were immediately sent by us to each of
the named owners, allowing them one month to improve the
sanitary conditions. At the expiration of the time, the
Health Officer and Milk Inspector personally visited every
one of the farms named and with few exceptions found
that conditions were much improved and that the changes
asked for had been put into effect. We are about to compile
a set of rules and regulations under which milk to be sold
in Holyoke shall be collected, stored, transported and delivered. These regulations when published will have the
force of law and then we shall be in position to enforce any
orders which we may deem necessary, along these lines.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.

The healthy and prosperous growth of building during
the past year, marks an era in the business of the Department
and its resources have been taxed to the utmost in giving the
necessary examinations and inspections. The Master Plumbers’ have experienced great difficulty in keeping up with
their work by reason of being unable to procure plumbers,
and many of them have found it necessary to work more
than one Helper with each Journeyman. This has caused
some dissatisfaction on the part of few of the plumbers,
and complaints have reached this office regarding same.
There is also evidence that some proprety owners have traps
wiped in by plumbers and installed in minor repair work by
so called “handy men’. In the opinion of the writer the
principal is wrong and many complaints have been made in
connection with this method by both Master and Journeyman
Plumbers. Your Inspector can find nothing in Chapter  ,
Revised Laws, as accepted by the City of Holyoke to regulate
the number of Helpers working with Plumbers, but the law
is emphatic in defining Journeyman Plumber. Section  ,
Revised Laws, Chapter  ““The word Journeyman as used
in this chapter, shall mean person who himself does any
work in plumbing which is by law, ordinance, by-law, rule
rule or regulation subject to (inspection).’”’ It would therefore
appear that these are matters that could be settled by the
Master and Journeyman Plumbers, but as there seems to be
some dissatisfaction, the subject is presented for consideration.

The work of the department is, and has been greatly
handicapped by the office hour from One to Two p.m. Practically all of the office work is done between the hours
  tog a. m., and the plumbers would appreciats the value of
the afternoon hour, giving as it does increased service. It
has been found necessary in cities of our size to limit the office
hours to one hour day and at present is necessity in Holyoke.

House bill abolishing the local Boards of Plumbing
Examiners and substituting State Examiners of Plumbers
has been in force since June and in the opinion of


. REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
the writer will give general satisfaction throughout the
Commonwealth.
In conclusion desire to thank the members of the Board
for their courtesy and co-operation.
Respectifully submitted,
F. L. AVERY,
Inspector of Plumbing.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.

Your Inspector has sent out sixty-two warnings for milk
below the standard. Two cases were prosecuted and fine
of  was imposed in each case.

Only one peddler was found having wooden plugs on
milk cans, he recived warning and discontinued their use.

In May and June the Inspector accompanied Dr.
Rose of the State Board of Health inspecting the dairies of
the producers that supply milk for this city and found
that in quite number of places the conditions were not what
they should be, and in two or three were positively bad. All
these recieved letters fron the State Board of Health and from
the Board of Health of this City, recommending changes and
improvements to bring them up to proper conditions.

In July and August the Inspector accompanied Health
Officer J. S. Wright, visiting the producers that had received
letters and found that with three or four exceptions the reccomendations of the Board had been carried out in full or
in part, the conditions being much improved.

Have visited the milk rooms and places where milk is
stored in this city and except in two or three found the conditions satisfactory. Have visited the places licensed to sell
milk in this city and reported conditions as found.

The practice of selling milk from cans in markets and
grocery stores where the cans measure and mixer are |
exposed to flies, dust and ordors is not sanitary and should
be stopped and rule for handling milk in these places adopted ,
Milk in bottles is the ideal way provided it is bottled properly.

A law requiring all dealers in milk to be licensed annually was approved June and all the stores and stands sellIng milk were required to obtain license. There are now two
hundred and twenty-five licensed places.

The standard for milk was printed wrong in the report
of last year. To quote the law it is

“Acts of  Chapter  ”.

“Milk that contains less than per cent milk solids
or less than per cent fat shall not be considered of good
standard quality.”

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
VINEGAR
Of the ninety-one samples tested only three were found
- to be below the standard and those were brought in by
producers for test.
OLEOMARGARINE

- There are now forty-one licenses for the sale of oleomargarine in the city. Have visited them and found that the
law was observed as far as having the license posted and the
proper marking on the packages.

Three parties have brought in samples to be tested
thinking them to be oleomargarine but in each case the
sample proved to be butter.

PETROLEUM

Forty-eight samples of kerosene oil have been’ tested

and found to be above the state standards.
- wish to thank the Health Officer and the Board of
Health for the assistance they have given me,
Respectfully,
JAMES K. MORRILL,
Inspector of Milk.

Report of Bacteriologist.
To the Holyoke Board of Health:

Gentlemen:—I herewith submit my report on the cases
referred to me for laboratory examination during the year
ending November .

This branch of your department is growing rapidly
as the great importance of the laboratory as diagnostic aid
is being recognized by the physicians more and more every
year. The proof of the latter is readily shown by the fact
that out of swabs sent in for diagnosis, were negative
showing that the physician depends largely upon the laboratory to eliminate diphtheria as well as to prove it’s existence.

There were reerred to me during the past year  
swabs, specimens of sputum and blood specimens for
Widal examination making total of examinations, The
fact that not one of the typhoid tests showed positive reaction is to me an interesting feature and tends to show the
result of the excellent condition governing our water and milk
supply, drainage systems, etc. The only regrettable fact is
that we do not have an opportunity to do Widal test upon
every case reported as typhoid and would suggest that your
board urge upon the physicians the advisability of submitting
a blood specimen from every such case in order that we may
have larger field from which to obtain our data.

Ophthalmia Neonotorum is subject to which the health
authorities throughout the country have of late years been
giving considerable attention and would recomend that this
be added to our list of laboratory examinations and the phy  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
sicians requested to submit for examination, specimens of
all eye discharges occurring in infants.

Should your board pass upon this will supply outfits
as soon possible and should we be successful in saving
but one pair of eyes year we should feel amply compensated
for the trouble and expense entailed.

I would again urge upon you the advisability of placing
a box in the outer vestibule of the High Street entrance to
the City Hall where swabs may be left at all times up to
nine o'clock at night. Such an arrangement would be much
more convenient for the physicians and would do away wit
the present more or less complicated system.

Appended you will find detailed report of the work
done during the entire year.

, Respectfully submitted,
J. J. CARROLL, M. D.

' REPORT OF
FIRE COMMISSIONERS.
OFFICE OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS,
Holyoke, Mass., January .
To the Honorable, the Mayor, and the Board of Aldermen:

GENTLEMEN :—In accordance with the requirements of
the ordinances of the city, your Board of Fire Commissioners
present to you their report for the year ending December  ,
 .

The Board met January II,  and organized by the
election of Charles L. Newcomb as chairman and George J.
Prew as vice-chairman, and John Hildreth as secretary.

Your Commissioners take pleasure in reporting another
successful year of work in the Fire Department. We
have had three hundred and fifty-one fires and alarms, the
largest number in any year in the history of the department.
As usual July was the busiest month of the year, there being
fifty calls in that month. One of the worst fires we had to
contend with was the fire on May  th, in the Donoghue block 
on the west side of Main Street, where the loss was nearly
half of the total loss for the year;—and at that fire John T.
McCarthy was seriously injured, falling four stories. He has
not been able to do active fire duty since, but for some time
past he has been acting as night watchman at the High
Street Engine House. It now looks probable that he will
ultimately recover and that there will be no permanent
injuries. There have been many narrow escapes from serious
accidents, especially from falling horses. The nature of our

}

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.

pavement makes it extremely dangerous work driving swiftly
moving heavy apparatus through the streets crowded with
vehicles of all descriptions, not to mention people on foot
and no matter how careful driver is, accidents are bound to
happen, as horses will sometimes stumble, and when they do
the life of the horse and driver will sometime be the penalty.

A standing rule of the department is to drive carefully,
but the firemen know well that few minutes’ delay often
means serious fire and the loss of much valuable property,
and even human life. In this connection we commend our
citizens for their promptness in calling the department when
a fre is discovered. The city has been generous in furnishing
fire alarm boxes to all parts of our city, and we trust that when
a fire is discovered, the party discovering the fire will first
ring in or telephone to headquarters an alarm and then try
to extinguish the fire.

We regret to report that three persons have lost their
lives from fire, Mrs. Mary Goodba on December ,
death caused by the explosion of lamp, and John and Arthur
Kurtz on Febraury The department was not called
to either of these fires.

Property of the value of nearly ten millions of dollars
has been endangered by the three hundred and fifty-one
alarms and only little over fifty-one thousand dollars loss,
shows in the strongest possible way the character of the work
done by the officers and firemen in the department, and we
offer to the chief, and the officers and men under him our
sincere congratulations for the splendid results achieved by
them; and we thank the City Government for their appreciation of the long and faithful services of the firemen in the
passing of hberal pension ordinance. We trust it will be a
long time before it becomes necessary to call upon the city
to act under this ordinance.

We want to thank the Water Commissioners for their
active co-operation with us in trying to make our city as
free from danver from fires as possible. They have been very
gencrous In putting in modern hydrants, and the equipping

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.  
of them with the Hercules [Independent Gate. Plenty of
hydrants means less hose, and consequently less running
expense.

Last year we were not able to purchase any hose. This
year we were obliged to purchase five thousand feet to keep
up the supply, as it would be almost criminal negligence to
allow the supply of good hose to run short. The very high
price of rubber makes the cost of hose very high, and in
making the appropriation this year it will be necersary to
take this into account. Your Commissioners have had many
years’ experience in the purchase of hose and believe that it is
wise and in the long run most economical to purchase the best
hose.

We commend the Fire Statistics for the past ten years
herewith submitted for the careful reading of our citizens. We
believe it to be remarkable record.

We thank your Honorable Mayor and Board of Aldermen for your generous appropriations, and your Commissioners assure you that they have expended the money so
appropriated so as to secure to the city the best possible
returns.

In making the appropriation for the coming year we
respectfully but earnestly ask you to give careful consideration
to the following recommendations, even if some of them
have been made for many years.

First—In accordance with the recommendations of the
National Board of Fire Underwriters, and the International
A ociation of Fire Tengineers, we believe that the time
has come to change the couplings on our hose for the clutch
coupling to thread coupling with threads to the inch.

This would make the couplings in all Fire Departments
interchangeable.

This will entail considerable expense but in the opinion:
of your Commissioners it would be money well spent.

SECOND—We recommend the purchase of horscless
vehicle for the Chief, for the Flying Squadron, and for the

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.

Chemical Engine No.  These ‘three pieces of apparatus
go to all fires, and the long runs required are too much for
the horses, consequently we have to purchase new horses
every few months.

We need new horses now, but are hoping that you will
enable us to purchase the above three picces of apparatus and
make the purchases of horses unnecessary. Horseless vehicles
in fire department service have long passed the experimental
stage, and are now used in all departments. These three
pieces of apparatus would enable us to get to Smith’s Ferry
and West Holyoke in quick time and give these parts of our
city fire protection.

THIRD—The changing of the headquarters from High
Street. We do not believe it is necessary to rehearse the
arguments in favor of this change. The necessity for the
change grows more imperative each year, and the chances
of getting good location are growing less each year.

FouRTH—We again recommend that Engine No. be
refitted with new pumps and engine. It has been in use
twenty-five years.

FirtH—We again recommend the putting of all wires
connecting the fire alarm system underground. We depend
on this branch of our service too much to continue to take
the risk of having the wires above ground any longer than
we are obliged to. There are several other improvements
needed in the fire alarm system, but until we get new headquarters we do not think it would be wise to undertake them. —

SIXTH— We recommend that House No. be sold and
a modern engine house suitable for this district be erected
somewhere near the center of the ward; and we suggest that
the vacant school house lot in this ward would make good
location for new house. The present location with its
splended railroad facilities could be sold for very considerable sum, so that with the school house lot, new house

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.  
could be erected with the expenditure of only small sum.
Sanitary conditions are far from good here.

The following is statement of the receipts and expenditures in the Fire Department for the year ending December
I,  :

Balance from last year 
Appropriations and transfers  
Receipt from sale of horses, hose, wagons, etc.

HAY AND FEED.

The constantly increasing prices of feed and the materials
used in this department makes the cost of maintaining it very
much higher, and we are hoping that the time will soon come,
when we can reduce the cost by the introduction of automobiles.

HOUSES.

The engine houses as whole were never in better condition
than they are at the present time. If the High Street engine
house ts to be used for any length of time, it will be necessary
to spend considerable money on this house, as it needs a
thorough cleansing throughout. The rooms at the headquarters for the accommodation of the men are the poorest
by far, of any house that we have.

So many men sleeping in room make it necessary that
the house should be repainted in the inside every vear at
least.

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.  
We have tolerated the poor condition hoping that it
would not be necessary to spend any money qn this house
by reason of the fact that the city was contemplating the
erection of new central house.
HORSES.

We have now forty horses in the department, two less
than last year. We are hoping that we shall require less
horses by the introduction of automobiles, but it will be
necessary the coming year to replace some of the horses that
are now showing signs of having passed their day of usefulness in the department.

HOSE.

The Commissioners have followed the practice of previous
years in purchasing the wax and gum treated hose entirely,
for the use of the department, and although this hose costs
a little more than the ordinary hose it is the cheapest in the
long run. They believe that the best hose that can be bought
is none too good for our use as broken length of hose very
seriously hampers the work of the firemen in extinguishing
a fire.

The following is the amount of hose on hand:
