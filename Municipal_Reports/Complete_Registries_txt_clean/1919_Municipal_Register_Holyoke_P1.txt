MAYOR’S ADDRESS.

To THE HONORABLE BOARD OF ALDERMEN :

The people of Holyoke have entrusted us with the management of the city’s affairs for the vear  and today we
take the oaths of office and begin the duties incumbent upon us
under the City Charter.

The solemn oath of office taken by each of us must mean
that we shall exercise the greatest discretion, not alone in the .
selection of officials but in all matters which shall occupy the
municipal mind during the coming year. here now pledge
myself to give you at all times my confidence regarding any
of the affairs of our city. shall be willing to consult you,
and have your advice and counsel rather than attempt to dictate to or coerce you, and expect from you encouragement, |
support and co-operation.

FINANCES

Bonds amounting to  were issued during the
year for the following purposes: Highways Construction,
$ Bridge Construction, Bath House Construction, Spanish Influenza, Sewers Construction, Sidewalks, Gas and Electric
Plant, .

Payment of the debt totalled  as follows: City
Debt, Gas and Electric Debt, Holyoke and
Westfield Railroad Debt, Water Debt, and
$  paid to the Sinking Fund, Water Debt. Sinking Fund

 MAYOR’S ADDRESS
accumulations, Water Debt, Excess of loans over payments, .

The total net debt, all sources, is as against
$  last year; an increase of This does not
include the outstanding temporary loans which this year are
$  against  last year.

The borrowing capacity is  as against 
last year—a decrease of .

That is the financial statement as reported by the City
Auditor.

We start this year with debt left by our predecessors
of approximately which, you know, is equivalent to.
about one dollar on the tax rate. The pay of officials, teachers, firemen, policemen and laborers has been increased no
doubt justifiably but no provision had been made for the increases In the budget. And liquor license fees and street
railway excise taxes will be lost to the city this year.

The financial condition of the city is startling, and while
the citizens are, through campaign sphes and newspaper
articles, somewhat familiar with this condition, believe now
is the time to inform them that even the ordinary affairs of
the city cannot be carried on without substantial raise in the
tax rate. And recommend that the ordinance which places
the tax limit at  shall immediately be amended to meet
this situation. also recommend that the State system of
municipal accounting be established here.

GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT

The most important problem confronting the Gas and
Electric Department at this time is that of obtaining inereased capacity at the electric station to meet the demands of
our mills and factories for more power. Since the plant was
taken over by the city from the Holyoke Water Power Company, seventeen years ago, there has been constant vearly

MAYOR’S ADDRESS  
increase in the amount of electricity sold for both lighting and
power purposes. The amount sold last year was nearly twenty
times the amount sold during the first year of municipal
operation.

That increase indicates not only that increasing population means greater sales of electricity, but also that the capacity of the plant must increase with the population and its
needs.

It is generally conceded that there is little or no room
for expansion at the present plant; that there is no land adjoining the plant available for the city’s use; that the water
for condensing purposes is insufficient when the canals are
empty; and that any expenditure made at the plant would
provide only temporary relief.

A committee of the Chamber of Commerce and the Board
of Aldermen has this subject under consideration. We should
seek an early solution of this problem.

THE SPRINGFIELD-WEST SPRINGFIELD BRIDGE

The special commission for the bridge to be built across
the Connecticut river between Springfield and West Springfield, created by an act of the Legislature, and appointed by
the Supreme Judicial Court, has reported to the court. Holyoke has taken an appeal from the decision of the single justice; which appeal is now pending. The proposed bridge is to
be gigantic structure, and the cost appalling. Holyoke will
be called upon to pay in the neighborhood of To

my mind this is an unspeakable injustice; and you and I
should pursue forceful campaign for legislation which will
relieve the city from this burden, if the appeal now pending
before the Supreme Judicial Court does not furnish the desired relief.
 

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS
CONCLUSION !
I have refrained from mentioning each City Department :
specifically because believe more earnest and thorough study !
of their needs is required before plans are formulated for
their conduct. But cannot refrain from warning the commissions and heads of departments that the day of lavish expenditures and politically crowded payrolls is over. The city’s
affairs must be managed with efficiency.
The people will not ask us to do the impossible; all they
require is that we apply ourselves in their behalf in an earnest |
effort to give clean, honest and intelligent government. Let
us harken to their appeal and make our city what she, because of her fine people and institutions, so richly deserves to
be, the foremost city in the Commonwealth.

The work in this department has been repetition of the
preceding years in which have been in charge.

I have placed one woman and eleven girls in the House
of Good Shepherd to give them an opportunity to reform |
and save them from Court record.

The laundry is also under my supervision, all articles
of bedding must be repaired or new ones made. The care of
the bedding is small item, yet the neglect of it would mean
much in the city’s finances.

All lost children brought to the station are placed in
charge of the matron.

I wish to express my gratitude to the Marshal and his
assistants, also the members of the department for their
courtesy and assistance in my work.

Respectfully submitted,
MARY T. SULLIVAN, 
| Matron.

In compliance with provision of the charter, respectfully recommend an appropriation for the ensuing year of
$ .

I can report with great satisfaction the continued low record of crimes and misdemeanors in our city during my
incumbency, the month of November was notable in that
there were fewer arrests than in any other month since the
organization of the Police Department.

The people of Holyoke can boast with pride of being in
a moral city free from houses of assignation. Crimes of
enormity and of revolting nature are rarity; these facts
are remarkable when it is taken into consideration that Holyoke is manufacturing city and has mixed population.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, beg to express my appreciation of the
many courtesies extended by his Honor the Mayor, the Judge
and Clerk of the Police Court, and the members of this department, and to thank them for the considerate attention to
matters pertaining to this department, and for the assistance
which they have rendered.

Respectfully submitted,

EDWARD J. GORMAN,
City Marshal.

: CORPORATIONS

The law under which corporations organized under the
laws of states other than Massachusetts were taxable on
Stock in Trade has been repealed and law  substituted
which provides for the assessment by the Tax Commissioner
of an excise tax and tax on the net income which is derived
from business carried on within the Commonwealth.

The tax collected under the new provisions, less one sixth
which is retained by the State will be paid to the city or
town in which the business is earried on.

REPORT OF BOARD OF ASSESSORS  

This year we had taxed to corporations organized as
above stock in trade valued at more than We
have no means of knowing whether or not under the new
provisions we will receive as much as we have in the past.

The Domestie Corporation tax law has also been changed
to provide for lesser excise tax than formerly and new
tax on the net income of the corporation which is derived
from business carried on within the Commonwealth.

One sixth of the tax paid under the provisions of this
law is to be retained by the state and the balance paid to the
city or town in which the business is carried on.

We have no means of knowing how this will effect the

, receipts we usually receive from this source.

RECOMMENDATIONS
We once more respectfully call to your attention the
urgent need at the City Farm, of suitable dairy barn,  ncreased storage room and piggery for the needs of the Institution. .
Farm implements, machinery, tools, etc., estimated at
a value of  are exposed to all weather conditions, as
| well as several tons of hay and corn stalks used for fodder.

REPORT OF OVERSEERS OF THE POOR  

Suitable storage for wagons, farm implements, etc.,
would insure against the frequent repairs that are constantly
necessary.

The present refrigerator used for the storage of perishable supplies is entirely inadequate for present needs. It is
located immediately adjacent to main steam pipe lead. A
larger new one should be immediately installed in more
convenient location.

We trust that these recommendations will be :given
earnest consideration and beginning made at least this
year.

, REPORT OF THE
Gas and Electric Department
City of Holyoke, Massachusetts.
Office of Gas and Electric Department,
January .
To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen:
GENTLEMEN: have the honor to submit herewith the
report of the Gas and Electric Department for the year ending November it being the seventeenth annual report
of the Department.
The amount of gas sent out in was cubie
feet, an increase of over the send-out in  ,
| The amount of electricity sent out in was |
kilowatts, loss of over the send-out in  .
The underground system of lighting has been extended !
- on High street from Cabot street to Norfolk street, where four- |
teen ornamental lights have been placed at the request of the
| business interests of that section.

The overhead system has been extended to take in all |
| the residences along Homestead avenue, from Cherry street |
| southerly in West street and connecting with the old lines at
: the City Farm. This extension provides electricity for do: mestie purposes but not for street lights.
Early in the year the Department transmitted to you a
proposition it received from the Turners Falls Power and
' Electric Company, in which it offered to supply the city with
such electricity as was required for the coming ten years. The
proposition has since been withdrawn and another proposition

REPORT OF GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT  
offered by the Turners Falls Power and Electric Company,
with terms not as favorable as those contained in the original
Proposition.

The Department was very much in favor of the acceptance of the first proposition because of the savings that might
be effected by it, and made special report upon the subject
to your body, under date of May The second propoSition, the Department did not and cannot favor, because of
the inereased price of same and the conditions under which
electricity was to be sold.

The Department has for several years been considering
methods of increasing the capacity of the present station or.
the advisability of constructing new station. Reports on
these two propositions have been submitted to committee
appointed to consider the question, composed of members of
the Board of Aldermen and members of the Chamber of Commerce. The question is still before the Committee and no decision has been made. It is hoped that an early decision will
be made, as the station capacity is almost reached, and it is
very doubtful if much more business can be taken on until additional capacity has been provided.

During the year your Board authorized bond issue of
$  to provide for new equipment at the Electric Station. After thorough study of the situation, it was decided

' not to expend the money for that purpose until decision on
the main question of increased capacity had been reached.
Consequently, only so much of the bond issue as was required
for extensions to the lighting system has been used of that
appropriation. There is on hand today, balance of more
than  unexpended in the Construction Fund.

THE GAS WORKS.

During the year, the old gas exhausting and tar extracting apparatus was replaced with high-speed exhauster, tar
 extractor, washer and rotary meter. The capacity of the ap  REPORT OF GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT
paratus replaced was but cubic feet of gas per day,
while the capacity of the new apparatus installed is  
cubic feet of gas per day, of the best type made and economical to operate. It is placed in remodeled, fireproof room,
and should take care of the cleaning of water gas for many
years to come.

There has also been erected new ash handling apparatus, consisting of an electrically-driven, self-dumping
hoist bucket, which elevates the ashes and dumps them into
a bunker overhead. From this bunker they are carted away
by trucks. No manual labor is required to load either into
the bunker or into the trucks, so that the apparatus is oper ated at small cost and with minimum of attention.

To the distribution system has been added services;
  feet of  -inch main; feet of  -inch main;  
feet of  -inch main; feet of  -inch main, and feet of
 -inch main. |

It is not expected that any additional equipment will be
required at the Gas Works during the coming year.

Bonds amounting to  have been retired out of
receipts of the year.

Respectfully submitted,
JOHN J. KIRKPATRICK, Manager.

ANNUAL REPORT OF

Holyoke Playground Commission
‘
 
To the Honorable the Mayor and Board of Aldcrmen of the
City of Holyoke:

 GENTLEMEN: We beg to submit for your consideration .
the Annual Report of Supervisor P. H. Kelly which presents
m detail the activities on the Holyoke Playgrounds for the
past Year, being the tenth since their institution.

Judging from the large attendance, the great interest
manifesteq@ and the efficiency attained, our Public Playrounds are supplying great need and are valuable part
of the official program of our city, of much constructive
value In bettering social condition, vital, active and positive
foree in the life of the community.

The Commission would emphasize the recommendation
of Supervisor Kelly regarding swimming, baseball, and the
need of new apparatus. There is great need of an up-todate pen air pool on the Hampden street grounds, inStead of the present bath house which we believe should be
abandoned.

We also desire to draw your attention to the possibility
of Wing the building on Bridge street (formerly used as a
  tank) as bath house for Ward Two.

The facilities for baseball should be greatly increased

  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS
and much of the play apparatus must soon be replaced if we
would obtain the maximum of benefits from the city’s investment in playgrounds. To do this generous appropriation for maintenance should be made. |
Respectfuly submitted,
THE PLAYGROUND COMMISSION,
ARCHIBALD A. BROOKS,
| Chairman.

Herewith respectfully present my eighth annual report as Supervisor of the Holyoke Playgrounds.

In spite of the unsettled condition in general, throughout the country our playgrounds have had most successful year. The interest which seemed somewhat deadened
during war times burst forth with renewed life and the
children turned to the playgrounds for directorship in the
games, ete., for it should be remembered that children are
hot born with knowledge of games. They must be taught
these as well as their school task, and so comes about the
need for play leaders which our playgrounds furnish. The
*xcltement of city life, the hustle and bustle, the noise and
confusion effect detrimentally the nerves and robustness of
children. It is the mission of the neighborhood playgrounds
to COunteract these affects, to invigorate the child physically
when Out of school and to send them back to their books
Stronger in body, alert in mind and with at least as high a
moral standard as when they left their workshop—The
School.
sh Our best authorities claim that one-half of child’s time
be Culd be spent out of doors and some go so far as to say, ,
nectter playground without schoolhouse than schoolSe without playground.”’

| REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS
I. SUPERVISION
During the past year, as always, we have striven for
the social betterment of the many rather than the individual development of few. So that while we have on our staff
| individual experts in athletics, dancing, basketry, sewing
| and other activities, their task is to inspire the many in
| the way of spending their leisure time and not to coach to |
high efficiency single team or individual. And further |
: we have tried to furnish recreational opportunities, which
mean primarily inspirational leadership and facilities, to
| all people regardless of age. The elimination of the saloon
has thrown burden and an opportunity of far-reaching possibilities, on the municipality of solving the leisure time
problem of adults, full playground program, scientifically fixed as to activities in relation to demands of age,
sex and physical condition as carried throughout the summer season. The hours of workers were divided into shifts
so that the various centers might carry on their programs
morning, afternoon and evening. This accommodated the
younger children and ‘‘little mothers’’ in the earlier periods,
permitted quiet interests during the heat of the day, encouraged participation on the part of the older boys and
girls in the late afternoon, and of the adults in the evening.
II. FOLK DANCING
Mary V. CRONIN, SUPERVISOR
Folk dancing continued to be the most popular activity
of the younger girls. The daily dancing periods under the
eareful instructions of Miss Mary Cronin increased in popularity, each playground was visited twice week, and one
hour each day was devoted to folk dancing on all of the
playgrounds. Girls like dancing better than any other form |
of play, and their instinct is not at fault. Folk dancing
combines many elements of expression and when so develREPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
oped as to give room for originality, affords wider avenue
of growth than perhaps any other form of play of either
sex. It has the physiological merits of the best gymnastics,
produces the exhilaration affect that comes from calling out
all the physical resources in natural way. Dancing is the
first of the arts and the most intimate parent of all the rest
and the most available for the great majority of people. It
is the inmost circle of emotional expression, the first and
most exuberant utterance of the joy of life.

III. INDUSTRIAL WORK |
) Miss Bripe C. HerBpert—SuPERVISOR
Desiring to foster spirit of greater industry among the
playground children of all ages, special emphasis was placed
this season upon handiwork. The results of this enterprise
have emphatically justified the efforts which were expended.
Under the able leadership of Miss Bride Herbert great
amount of work was accomplished. The girls on each playground were divided into groups. The elementary and the
advaneed. With this plan and the co-operation of the girls
with their teachers, greater results were accomplished. The
elementary work consisted of winding raffia to make the
simpler articles such as picture frames, napkin rings,
whisk broom holders, and book marks. By braiding the raffia, small haskets, teapot mats, school bags, doll caps, and
coat hangers were made. Baskets of all kinds were turned
out by the older girls. Among these might be mentioned
pin trays, small and large sewing baskets, sandwich trays,
eard receivers, flat sewing baskets, collar button baskets, and
jardinieres. The woven reed work included glass trays with
wooden bases, fruit baskets, stocking baskets, bud vases,

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
candlesticks, waste baskets, and hanging baskets. The quality of finished work was very satisfactory, particularly in
the sewed baskets, many of them called forth praise for
their artistic designs and perfect finish.

The popularity of chair caning was more evident than
ever. During the past season over four hundred chairs
Were re-seated. Chair caning is considered boy’s occupaon although girl is never refused the privilege of caning
should she desire to do so. The boys were furnished with
cane and were allowed to cane as many chairs as they pleased.

SEWING, KNITTING AND CROCHETING
Mrs. Mary KosTENBADER—SUPERVISOR
 ‘Xs in previous years instructions in the needle arts were
 given’ daily on all our play centers. In addition each playground was visited once week by the supervisor who
planned and designed the work. The usual sewing course
Covered the fundamentals of sewing. The simpler work for
the OUNnger girls and the more difficult for the older girls.
The Sarments are cut by the girls either from patterns or
by directions as the teacher deems best. The garments to be
made are those best suited to the girl. Each process of conhe om following in logical order until the garment is finMany beautiful kinds of crochet, cross-stitch, and emtroidery Pieces were finished as well as dresses, aprons,
mddy blouses and bloomers. Materials were generously
Supplied by the commission at very small cost per child.

SKATING
Five skating rinks were maintained during the winter
months as follows: Hampden Street, Maple Street, West
Street, Joseph Metcalf School, Newton’s Pond.
Skating surfaces on the small ponds were planed and
scraped and kept in excellent condition for thousands of
' skaters using these ponds. Owing to the extra mild winter,
the ice on the larger ponds was not of sufficient thickness to
permit the use of horses to scrape and plane the surface
and danger signs were posted except during about three
weeks of the winter season.

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
BAND CONCERTS
Among the many enjoyable features of entertainment
furnished on our public parks and playgrounds were the
band concerts and community singing. These concerts were
held on Sunday evenings from to on the Prospect
Field, West Street, Hamilton Park, Springdale Park, and
Library. They were largely attended by all classes of people who were very much interested and joined in enthuslastically in the singing of patriotic songs. The concerts
were made possible through special appropriation of
Money by the city government and were in charge of the
playground commission.
EVENING PLAYGROUND SESSIONS
Four playgrounds, Maple Street, Hampden Street,
West Street and Morgan School grounds were open evenM&S with supervised play from until P. M. during the
months of July and August. The playgrounds selected for
the €vening session were those located in the thickly populated Seetions of our city. Advantage of the extra hour of
daylight was taken by all persons seeking outdoor recrea-.
tion, During the evening hours the ball diamonds on the
“nous playgrounds were used exclusively by those who
“ere employed during the day and large number of adults
could be found on any pleasant evening taking: part in the
different activities. The primary aim of this department is
to Provide suitable recreation grounds where all citizens
ad Meet for physical improvement and mental relaxation,
ma uraBe and promote the practice of beneficial sports
from In addition to the physical well-being resulting
reere Open air sports, it must never be forgotten that our
sense on fields furnish most proficient exercise for the
essa of Justice, fair play, and unselfishness, absolutely neeTY in any worth-while character. During the eighth

week that the four playgrounds were open, the total attendance was  The average nightly attendance was
  on all grounds together.
SWIMMING AND BATHING
During the past season one wading pool, two shower
baths, and one swimming pool were maintained and located
as follows: Wading pool, Hampden Street; shower baths
at the Whiting School and Boys’ Club; swimming pool,
Ward  .
The baths at Whiting School were open from to  
A. M., and to P. M. in charge of Mrs. Winifred Knightly
and Miss Jennie Sullivan. The showers at the Boys’ Club
, were open during the month of August from to daily in
charge of playground instructors. The Ward bath house
was open for period of nine weeks during the months of
July and August from to A. M., from to  
P. M., and on Wednesday and Friday evenings from to
 Two lady instructors from the playgrounds were in
charge on Wednesday and Friday afternoons and evenings,
when the baths were given over to the use of the girls. One
of the greatest needs of our playgrounds is better swimming
facilities. Every child should be given the opportunity to
Jearn to swim. Of the hygienic value little need be said.
All men, women and children, owe it to themselves to be
able to learn to swim. If there is any doubt about the wisdom of providing better swimming facilities it should be
dispelled by the record of attendance. They are impressive,
but no amount of dry statistics can begin to tell the great
good that can be accomplished here for the boys and girls of
our city. |

SPECIAL EVENTS

The special events which occurred during the past season are worthy of record. At the start of the season meeting of the directors and workers was held at the playground
office and plans were talked over to stimulate and increase
the children’s attendance. It was decided that during the
season the directors plan some special events on their respective grounds. The result was very gratifying and a
number of events were held such as Doll’s Day, Baby’s Day,
Patriotic Day, and Carnival Day. Each director planned

| their own program and at some of the events other grounds
were invited to visit and take part with them.
FIELD DAY AND PICNIC

The annual Field Day which in former years was participated in by boys only was changed this year to picnic

, and Field Day so that the girls might take part as well as the
boys. The event was held on the Springdale Park, Thursday,
August  and proved very successful, as over two thousand
ehildren with their parents attended.

This event is always looked forward to with great interest as all compete for the championship of the city in their
respective divisions, the Midgets, Juniors, and Seniors. The
events consisted of potato races, hat races, relay races, ,
and yard dashes. First, second, and third prizes were
awarded the winners in each event, and individual prizes
were given each winner. The prizes were donated by A. Steiger Co., the Osborne Hardware Co., and C. E. Walker Co.

| Six playgrounds were represented and the grounds scoring
the greatest number of points received silver cup. This
was presented by the playground commission and was won by
Maple Street playgrounds. |

STORY TELLING
The periods of story telling varied on the different
playrounds, according to the needs of the children, that iS,
at times as the directors and play leaders thought that the
children needed rest and relaxation from the more strenuous
play. Story telling may be developed in way which will
arouse much interest among children. It is the least restricted and the possibilities in story telling for guiding the
muds mind to the best of everything in the world are limitess.
BASEBALL
The great American game of baseball, as might be expected, was the most popular game on our loeal playgrounds
  In former years. At the start of the season, three leagues
Were organized: the Midgets, Junior and Senior Leagues. The
grounds represented were: the Elmwood, Maple Street, Whiting Sehool, Hampden Street, West Street, and Morgan School.
The Midgets played schedule of thirty games, the games
being played on Tuesday and Thursday afternoon. The Jumor and Senior leagues played schedule of sixty games
each. The Junior league games were played on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings and the Senior league games
were played on Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoons.
A total of one hundred and fifty games were played, representing different boys. Great interest was manifest in
each league and the games were witnessed by thousands of
Spectators and friends of the boys.

  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS
; West Street won in the Midget and Junior League, while
Morgan School carried off the honors in the Senior league.
This was the first time in the history of the playground that |
the Morgan School ever won baseball pennant. |
| CITY LEAGUE BASEBALL |
In spite of the fact that war curtailed to large extent |
athletics in general, the City Baseball League through the ef- :
forts of Mr. Thomas McCullough, president, continued to en- :
joy the same success which characterized its inauguration. :
The purpose of the organization in its endeavor to eliminate |
the undesirable elements of professionalism and commercial- |
ism from its ranks and to place baseball on higher plane of  
pure amateurism received new stimulus from the war time
conditions, after the stress and strain which the boys went ,
through, both those who went ‘‘over there’’ and those who
were employes of the plants whose output was so essential to
the national welfare. This league afforded much needed
opportunity for relaxation and recreation. Unfortunately
this league was exterminated in the very height of its season.
A full schedule of games had been arranged and the keenest
of interest had been aroused among the players and the
erowds of happy men and women who gathered weekly to
watch these good clean amateur ball games. Then came the
unexpected visit from the State Police who ordered that ,
Sunday baseball be stopped in Holyoke, their orders were adherred to in the quiet manner that always marks our boys’
attitude toward the wishes of higher authorities, yet it was
not without pang of regret and remorse that our boys, men,
women and children gave up the only recreation that they
had known on Sunday for long time.
PLAYGROUND STAFF
The successful operation of the playgrounds is due partly
to the splendid co-operation of the directors in charge. Their
effective work in organizing teams, teaching athletics and

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
games and promoting play in all its features added materially to the usefulness of the playgrounds. The directors
and workers fully realize the importance and responsibility
connected with their positions and aware of the tendency of
the children to imitate them in their habits,of sph and
manner, have displayed tact, patience, and good judgment at
all times. As measure of promoting efficiency administration meetings were held frequently for discussion of playground topies and for the exchange of ideas and experiences
as they would apply to the respective grounds.

RECOMMENDATIONS
A. SWIMMING
The problem of better bathing facilities is one of the |
important matters that will require the attention of the commission the coming year. At the present time we have but
one bath house where children can swim. This is loeated
in Ward Four and is inadequate and unfit. would reeommend that this bath house be returned to the Board of
Public Works and more modern swimming pool be conStructed on the Hampden Street Playground and that
Other pools be constructed in different seetions of the city.
B. BASEBALL AND FOOTBALL FIELDS
, At present we have four baseball and football fields.
Elmwood, Maple Street, West Street and Prospect Field.
Those fields are in very poor condition and sadly in need of
repairs as they have received but very little attention during
the past two years. This was due to the fact that the appro, priation granted the playground commission has not been
sufficient to meet the upkeep or permit any improvements.
T would recommend that these grounds be put in proper
condition. They should be re-loamed, leveled and re-surfaced.

  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS
C. APPARATUS
The more playground is patronized the more progressive are the demands of an appreciative public and
, therefore larger will become the expense of its maintenance.
Improvements may be made but they soon decay if not properly maintained. Some of our apparatus has been in use
several years and is in need of repairs and others should be
replaced.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
A few words of acknowledgment are due those interested
in the ever growing sentiment for better play in Holyoke. |
The splendid spirit of the corps of instructors and the hearty |
co-operation of the various city departments, private con- |
cerns and individuals were much appreciated.
Special thanks is due the School Board for granting
the use of school buildings and grounds for play purposes
and to the Park Board for allowing the use of parks for
play and band econeerts. The A. Steiger Co., C. E. Walker
Co., and Osborne Hardware Co. are to be commended for
their generosity in furnishing the prizes for the annual
- Field Day. word of thanks must be extended.also to the
Holyoke Water Power Company for the use of the Berkshire Street grounds for baseball. To Mr. Michael J. Gleason, our Playground Superintendent, am very grateful for
his ever ready and willing assistance. To the Board of Playground Commissioners, want to thank you most heartily
for the consideration you have given to my suggestions and
to express my appreciation of your progressive work in connection with the playgrounds.
Respectfully submitted,
P. H. KELLY,
Supervisor.

PART II.
REPORT OF THE SCHOOL BOARD.
To His Honor, the Mayor, and the Citizens of Holyoke:
The School Board respectfully submits this Annual Report for the year  It is brief general statement. It
‘deals only with essential topics, leaving the details for the
report of the Superintendent of Schools.
FINANCES
This Board tried to follow the financial policy of
previous boards—namely, to request reasonable appropriation and to spend that appropriation wisely and in proper
apportionment. large sum of money was spent for our
publie schools in  Those who study the figures will
find that practically all of the increase over the expenditure
of the previous year was used to raise the salaries of the
employees of this Department.
SCHOOL BUILDINGS |
It is time that our school buildings should receive attention in the matter of repairs and improvements. It has
been pointed out in previous reports that the authority in
this matter rests with the Board of Public Works by direction of the City Charter. The School Board, having no
power in the matter of repairs and alterations in school
buildings,  not disposed to feel responsible for the poor
condition of some of our school property at this time. There
is no need of visits or surveys in this matter. The school

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
authorities know just what should be done, and where it
Should be done. The School Board respectfully submits that
this condition will never be wholly satisfactory until the
School Board has the full right and duty of caring for the
buildings and property which it uses.

SALARIES
The so-called war schedule of salaries in effect September,  has been made permanent, and is now part of the
regular salary. Through the cooperation of other branches
Of the City Government, the School Board was able to grant
to all employees of the Department flat increase of 
beginning in September,  While it may be argued that
these increases merely restore the lost purchasing power of
the dollar, it is also true that the present salary schedule in
EX olyoke compares favorably with similar schedules in cities
Whhich may be reasonably compared with ours.
NEW SCHOOL BUILDINGS
The School Board urges that the work of constructing
the new Lawrence School be begun at once. As an eduational and as business proposition, this project is well
Known to the citizens of IJolyoke. Under the provisions of
the City Charter the School Board can go no further than
 hhas already gone in this matter. new building, which
O ]d be used both as schoolhouse and as community
Cemter, should be constructed in the Smiths Ferry District.
It is also imperative either to provide new buildings or to
Make substantial improvements in the West Holyoke district and in the so-called Ewingville district.
REORGANIZATION
The old nine-four plan is giving way to the six-threethree plan, sometimes called the Junior High School system
 

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
of school organization. As pointed out in previous reports,
the reorganization is being completed step by step with the
| idea of changing an old thirteen year system into modern
twelve year system. The first real Junior High School class
in Holyoke will be graduated from the Lawrence School in
June,  Within year our entire school system will
have three distinct units instead of two, and all three will
be so closely correlated that we can eall our public school
organization twelve year system.
EVENING SCHOOLS
This year has brought somewhat better attendance in
our evening schools, and especially in the Evening High
School. The return of normal times is bringing back our
former evening school population, and another year will see
our evening schools as large as they were previous to the
war.
STATE LEGISLATION
Very many measures covering educational matters were
proposed for enactment in the Massachusetts Legislature. Many of these measures failed of enactment. Some
 measures were passed, and these will make demands upon
the School Board for enforcement. The three principal acts
. which will add to the duties of the local School Department
are:
The promotion of Americanization; the organization of
a compulsory continuation school; and the administration
locally of the General School Fund Act. Most of the other
laws which were enacted refer to minor matters.
FENTON PROPERTY
The School Board still feels that the Fenton property,
adjacent to the Elm Street School, should be purchased.
The reasons for this have been frequently given and pubREPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
lished. The School Board’s recommendation is in the hands
of the City Government. It is enough to say that play space
is needed for the Elm Street School; that the city should
protect itself against the erection of garage or apartment
block on what is now the Fenton property; and that the interests of the children who will be called upon to attend the
Elm Street School for years to come are greater than any
financial considerations.

SUMMER SESSION AT HIGH SCHOOL
The School Board recommends the continuing of the
Summer session at the High School. This institution has
had three very successful sessions. As in the past, opportunities should be provided for pupils of the grammar
grades as well as for pupils of high school standing. This
Session is time saver for pupils, is money saver for parents, and, as measure of general improvement for our
school pupils, has made notable achievement.
SCHOOL HYGIENE
The health and physical education of our school children is in charge of special department called the Department of School Hygiene. The work of this department
Continues to be very satisfactory. As time goes on, additions
anc improvements are needed. The observations and reports
of those in the Department of School Hygiene have recorded
during the past two years an alarming condition regarding
the teeth of our school children. This report corresponds
With similar reports made in other cities. The School Board
should take steps toward definite work in dental hygiene for
the children of our schools.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT.
To the School Board of Holyoke:

Your Superintendent herewith submits report of the
Holyoke publie schools for the year  This is his eighth
annual report, and the fifty-sixth volume in the series of
printed reports issued by the School Board.

FOREWORD

It is not the aim of this report to cover the various
activities, divisions and departments of the public school ;
system. Such detailed information is to be found in the
different parts of this volume. By consulting the table of
contents, the reader will be able to find the organization and
Teport of the School Board; the calendar and terms of the
Schoo] year; reports of principals, supervisors and attend‘nce officers; and the complete statistical information cov‘ring every phase of the school system.

 Your Superintendent has edited the various parts of
this Volume, with view to making it complete whole. His
WN report will be confined to several important topics of
Special interest to the School Board and to the general
publie.

SCHOOL MEMBERSHIP

From through there was healthy growth in
Schoo] membership. In there came slight loss—a deCrease of pupils. In there was decrease, and in
  sheht gain. Again, in  there came loss. It
Was followed in by good increase. There is every

ap

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

. prospect of substantial gain in school membership in
 but it is fact that our school membership figures
since have not been satisfactory. Here, as in other
cities, this may be attributed to many factors like war and
post-war conditions, the attraction of high wages in industry
to pupils who reach the age of  the large private school
membership in Holyoke, and the fact that the population of
the city itself has not increased very much. It is reassuring
that within the compulsory school age, that is, from to  ,
a healthy growth is noted.

FINANCES

For the fiscal year, which ended November ,
this department, by regular and special appropriations,
receipts and transfers, received and expended the sum of
$  for salaries. The sum of  was expended for supplies, balance of cents remaining in this
account.

This very large increase in running expenses is due almost wholly to revised salary schedules, one revision alone
ealling for an increase of  per year in the salary of
every employee of the Department. To make operative this
increase alone for September, October and November of  ,
a special appropriation of  was required. Further
increases are to be expected because there must be no reduction in salaries, nor can the number of employees be reduced.

SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND REPAIRS

An ideal building program would include new schools
in West Holyoke, Smith’s Ferry, Ewingville district, and in
the Lawrence School district. At present the most pressing
need is in the Smith’s Ferry district where thirty children
receive transportation to and from the Highland School.
The eost of transportation alone,  month, would pay

| interest for borrowing almost enough money to build and
equip schoolhouse in the Smith’s Ferry district. ,
The situation as to repairs and alterations on school
buildings can hardly ever be satisfactory until the School
Board by special legislation is given charge of the construction, repair and alterations of its own buildings and property,
subject of course to the authority, in financial way, of the
Board of Aldermen.
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION

During many new and important educational laws
were passed. The principal enactments are the following:

(a) An act to promote Americanization through the
education of adult persons unable to use the English language,

(b) An act which amends the compulsory school attendance laws so that the grade which must be completed

| before employment cards can be issued is raised from the
fourth to the sixth grade.

(c) An act requiring the establishment and maintehance of continuation schools and courses of study for emPloyed minors between the ages of and  which act was
“Pproved by referendum vote in this city.

(d) An act requiring cities and towns to determine the
Number of children retarded in mental development, and to
Provide for their instruction. :

(e) An act providing for the distribution of portion
of the income tax, and of the income of the Massachusetts

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
This is the principal educational legislation which was
enacted. The local school authorities have either made these
laws effective here, or have made plans to do so within the
required time. .
THE FIVE SCHOOL UNITS :
These are the kindergartens; the elementary schools (six )
grades) the Junior High Schools (seventh, eighth and ninth
years) the Vocational Sehool; and the Senior Iligh School. |
In each unit the work of the year has been very satisfactory.
One year ago your Superintendent in closing his report used
the following words:
“War conditions, two epidemics, the very severe winter

our country, and the various losses that nation and people at war must suffer, have left their mark on many publie
, school system. Let us fill the year with intensive work, well
planned and well carried out, so that the pupils will soon
reach their goal, despite past handieaps.’’
It is pleasure to report that this plea was not made in
vain, and that the eurrent school year promises even greater
things aceomplhshed.
SPECIAL DEPARTMENTS
The reports of the supervisors of the special departments
, of School Hygiene, Manual Training, Household Arts, Drawing, Musie and Writing, have been edited by your Superintendent and appear, in excerpts, in Part. of this volume.
In the same part are incorporated the reports of the Principal of the Evening Iligh Sehool, the Schoolhouse Agent,
and the Supervisor of Home and School Gardens. In Part
VI of this volume is statistical report on School Savings
Banks and sale of Thrift and Savings Stamps.
 

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
EVENING SCHOOLS

Satisfactory progress, with somewhat better attendance, was made in the elementary evening schools during
the year  The Evening High School had an exceptionally suecessful year, and this is fully reported upon by Principal Garvey in Part of this volume.

ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS

The work of Miss Jennie E. Seolley calls for word of
special commendation. Among the many tasks assigned to
her were the administrative duties connected with teaching,
teaching methods, courses of study in the kindergartens and
in the first six grades; Junior Red Cross work; campaign
activities; war work in the schools; eompiling of new courses
of study; conference work with women principals; various
forms of school publicity; Americanization work, and so on.
Each duty was most satisfactorily performed. Miss Scolley’s
first. statement of her work accomplished is appended to this
report.

THRIFT

Efforts to form and encourage habits of thrift among the
public school pupils met with the greatest success during the
year. The work proded along two well known lines:
(a) Sehool Savings Banks and the sale of Thrift and War
Savings Stamps; (b) Home and School Gardens.

The statistical report of Miss Mabel Baush reveals the
fact that the publie school children from September,  to
December,  saved  in the Sehool Savings
Banks, of which amount the sum of  was saved in

PENMANSHIP
| Since February,  the Palmer Method of writing has
| been in use in the Holyoke public schools as well as in hun! dreds of other school systems in the country. The Palmer
! Method prepares teachers to write and to teach muscular
' movement penmanship. Practically, it provides for the
pupils definite graded course of study in penmanship which
leads to free, rapid, legible handwriting. The accompanying

THE ECONOMIC LEAGUE
| The year saw the uniting of the public school
teachers of the city into an organization called the Economie
| League. Such an organization should have tremendous
power for good in school work. It should not stand merely
! for salary increases. Far more, it should stand for great

that classroom teachers shall now have part in determinating edueational policies. Organizations of this kind stand

Boards of Education and to the judgment and executive
ability of their administrative officials the effective participation of classroom teachers in the development of policies
which control education.”’

WORK FOR  

For number of years, in each annual report your Superintendent has asked the School Board to give earnest consideration to the doing of ten different things. Most of
these have been done successfully. On aecount of lack of
money and time few remain unaccomplished. For a
few of the old plans and some new problems are presented
in the form of recommendations as follows:

 That in one of the South Holyoke schools special
help class for atypical children similar to the class at the
Elm Street School, be organized at any early date;

 That ‘‘steamer classes,’’ so-called, be organized in
several schools. These classes are for children who do not
speak English and who are therefore misfits in regular
elasses. Such children are handicap to the others in the
gerade. They should be given special opportunity to
acquire the English language rapidly ;

 That the School Board publish and adopt ‘‘The
Holyoke Citizens’ Book’’—a book on local community civics
compiled by students of Mount Holyoke College, the Chamber of Commerce and the School Board;

 That school nurse be elected in the department of
Sehool Hygiene and that some work in dental hygiene be
established a

o. That the present work in Americanization be extended ;

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

 That the School Board appeal for special legislation
which will place within its authority the construction, alteration and repair of school buildings;

 That school work and results be studied and reported
upon by standards and tests; :

 That there be further broadening and extending
of High School work and activities to meet the needs and
serve the interests of all the students;

 That two-room school building with community
hall be constructed in the Smiths Ferry district;

 That there be improvement and steady advancement
of the teachers’ position, both from the professional and
from the economic standpoint.

Respectfully submitted,
FRANCIS McSHERRY,
Superintendent.
I append the first annual report of Miss Jennie E.
Seolley, Assistant Superintendent of Schools:
To the Superintendent of Schools:

I herewith submit brief report of the leading elements
of my work from the date of my appointment in October,
 to January This is my first report as Assistant Superintendent of Schools:
| COURSES OF STUDY

The first year of my new work was given chiefly to the
preparation of the courses of study, in all subjects from the
kindergarten through the grades, and to studying the standards and problems of our school system, especially of the

wv
| REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
first six grades, which my supervision covers. This work
called for the careful study of the best school systems in this
State, as well as of other states, their standards and equipment, their development, and so on.

As the courses were prepared in general way, meetings of the various committees appointed by the Superintendent of Schools were called and the work explained, discussed, and criticized. Thus, subject by subject, the work
was carefully prepared and given the Superintendent, who
examined and approved the courses, later placing them in
the hands of the principals and teachers. In every ease the
course introduced was tentative, or trial one. This work
was my first step. )

 SUPERVISION

My study of the schools at that time led me to believe
that. more uniformity in the interpretation of the courses of
study, more cooperation between grades and buildings, and
the strengthening of the work in English was the next step.
Mamy conferences were held with the Superintendent of
Schools, with whom every step of my work is discussed and
approved before being introduced.

Carefully prepared plans, outlines, and suggestions weré
given, and grade meetings were held between and o’clock
each day, at which the subjects of the grade were studied in
detail. The unity of purpose, cooperation, and initiative
displayed by all brought excellent results. have usually
spent each day from to in the schools observing,
direeting, and teaching, with the specific aim of improving
“ "s room instruction and raising the standard: of the
methods used. .

This year, besides continuing the work already started
and following the new courses of study carefully, the emphasis will be placed on three important phases of classroom instruction, namely: The Recitation, Supervised
Study, and Interpretive Reading.

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS |
| The Recitation: We aim to have better forms of recita- |
tion—more socialized forms. During the recitation, children should be trained to discuss problems which are vital
to them, where the question of the pupil comes as frequently
as that of the teacher. spirit of inquiry and investigation
is encouraged. |
Supervised Study: We should train children to study.
We cannot command children to study, but must teach them
, how to study and to appreciate the value of study.
Interpretive Reading: Certain methods of procedure
should be followed by which pupils are trained how to get
quickly and accurately the meaning from the printed page.
Careful instruction in silent reading, with oceasional use of
silent reading tests is advised. Our aim is high and every
principal and teacher seems to have the right spirit—that of
making our schools second to none in the State.
| ADMINISTRATION
. The administrative duties of my position are varied.
They may be briefly summarized in these words—any work
or assignments given me by the Superintendent of Schools.
The following are concrete examples of some of these
duties or assignments:
Individual eonferences with principals and teachers on
individual problems where particular help and advice are
needed.
Conferences with principals regarding adjustments
which they may have recommended to the Superintendent of
Schools.
Visiting eandidates for teaching positions in our schools,
who teach outside of the city. The object of such visiting
is to observe the work of these teachers and report ratings
to the Superintendent of Schools.
. The examination and study of text books, so that the
best books and the ones most suited to our needs may be
recommended for adoption.

| AMERICANIZATION

After-the-War problems have now arisen, and are being

bravely faced by our educators. Americanization is one of
them and the School Department has accepted its share of
the work, as one of its duties to the citizens of our eity. Mr.
John J. Mahoney, the State Supervisor, says: ‘‘ Americanization—to give the term its most comprehensive meaning—Is
the business of making good eitizens, the business of making
eood Americin eitizens, the business of aequainting every
one who inhabits American soil with both physical and spiritual Ameriea, to the end that this aequaintanece may result in
a sturdy loyalty to American institutions and American
ideals, and the habit of living the life of the good American
citizen. Really to Ameriecanize Ameriea it is necessary to
reach the native born and the immigrant, the adult and the
child in school, and incidentally the task of Amerieanizing
the new comer will be rendered comparatively easy if we
ean but sucd first in Americanizing ourselves.’’

The teaching of English to the new American is the first
step in this great work. Superintendent MeSherry is chairman of the Amerieanization Committee of the Chamber of
Commerce. Many duties of administration and finance fall
upon him. The direetion and supervision of the classes are
some of my duties. The time given to this supervision  s
from to o’eclock, evenings, and Saturday mornings. In
preparation for this work class of eighteen teachers was
formed and instruction in the direct method of teaching
Enelish to adult foreigners was received. This class has .
eontinued the study of methods and meets with me once a
month for the study of racial backgrounds, the preparation
of themes, and diseussion of the work.

In our day schools, through the principals and teachers,
broad, sympathetic, and intellegent work in Americanization

has always been carried on. class of one hundred and
twenty men forming the Citizenship Class was taught at the
Evening High School, where the men were prepared for the
taking out of their first and second naturalization papers.
We have twelve classes in the industries. There are three
classes in the Crocker-MeElwain Mills, four classes in the
Chemical Mill, three in the Prentiss Wire Mill and there
will be four or five classes in the Farr Alpaca Mills. One
class of Polish women is taught at the Lawrence School
every Friday evening. The American Writing Paper Company is also preparing for the work. The arrangement of
el sses for the paper mills brought forth some problems, on
account of the men working in shifts. Our plan is working
admiravly now. Much enthusiasm is shown, and much
valuable work is being accomplished.

Miss Nellie Perry, who has special qualifications for the
work, is the first full-time teacher employed. She is doing
excellent work.

CONCLUSION

The introduction of the Junior High School organization into our school system shortens the elementary work one
year. For this reason, and because of full curriculum, I
recommend that the entrance age of all first grade pupils be
raised to five years and six months. also urge that some
sub-primary work be undertaken by the advanced group in
the kindergarten in February of each year. This work .
should be under first grade teachers in the afternoon. This
plan may result in larger enrollment in the kindergartens.

I have had the hearty cooperation of both principals
and teachers in all my work.

I take this opportunity of thanking you for your kind
eonsideration at all times, and for the advice and help so
generously given.

Respectfully submitted,
JENNIE E. SCOLLEY.

PART IV.
REPORT OF PRINCIPAL OF THE
HIGH SCHOOL.
- To the Superintendent of Schools:

In September,  for the first time in five years, the
schools opened with the world again at peace, with school
plans and work once more assuming normal conditions. This
is noticed in larger and more regular attendance, and with
relatively fewer withdrawals in the vear than for
any similar time since  —all this in spite of the fact that
industry offers large wages to the youthful and unskilled
employee.

Never has there been such demand upon the school to
supply pupils for work outside of school hours and to furnish
boys and girls for permanent positions. While many pupils
accept work that can be done in the afternoon or evening,
few seem tempted to leave school for full-time employment.
No doubt it is necessary for many boys and girls to work in
order that they may remain in school, but should the demand for this labor continue, and should the number of
pupils accepting such employment become greater, it would,
In my opinion, be well to modify the courses so that the employed pupil may be able to do satisfactory grade of school

| work and, at the same time, continue in employment. With
this end in view would recommend that courses for such
pupils be extended one year, and the pupil required to take
a more limited schedule of studies. He then could do some
of his studying during the morning session; could be dismissed earlier in the day; and would not be obliged to do

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
the amount of home work now required of him at the close
of his working hours. These courses could be made somewhat correlative with the work which the pupil is doing outside of school. The girl -in the office could emphasize the
commercial subjects; the girl doing home work could specialize in the household arts course; and the boy in the shop
eould confine himself largely to the subjects of the technical
course. For minimum requirement in these courses I
would suggest fifteen hours week in place of the nineteen
hours now required. Where unprepared work is taken, two
hours would count for one, when compared to the prepared
work. would be glad to submit schedule of such courses
more in detail with the hope that they may be put into force }
in the fall of  .

I believe that the Holyoke High Sehool is doing for the
youth of this city as much, and in some ways more, than is 
being accomplished by many other high schools in cities even
much larger than Holyoke. This is particularly true in the
department of Physical Education, and in the opportunities
offered by the Summer School. With the Junior High
School, followed by the Senior Ihgh School, the boy and girl
are taken from the sixth grade to the last year of the high
school in regular program of work. After that, the bey or
girl, if prepared, continues his studies in eollege largely
through the finaneial ability of the parents, combined with
the willingness and ambition of the pupil to obtain this
higher edueation.

TIome conditions, difficulties in obtaining financial assistance, and reluctance of parents to the child leaving home,
often prove serious obstacles to the prepared and ambitious
pupil who wishes to eontinue his schooling beyond the High
School. believe the time has come for the serious consideration of the establishment in Holyoke of Junior College. This in no way needs to curtail or modify the work
of the regular High School courses, but gives to the college
preparatory pupil the opportunities of taking the first and

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
second year of college work at home. In many places such
courses are offered successfully, and results show that an
increased number of pupils complete this high school course,
enter the junior -colleges, and, in time continue further
either in regular college courses, or professional schools. To
quote from report on the Junior College: ‘‘For more than
thirty years there has been in the United States gradual
evolution of the idea that the first and second years of the
university are distinetly secondary in character, differing
alike in periods, content, and organization from the later
years of the period of higher education. To this period of
two years, where attached to the high sehool or university,
the word, ‘junior college’, has been applied, and, at present, in number of states seems quite generally accepted.”’
. Quoting further, this report says: ‘‘The junior college today
is the result of the demand of an intelligent public that the
opportunities for receiving higher education be brought
within the reach of all, just as the high school has been and
is the result of sueh previous demands’’.

For number of years eertiin subjects offered in many
colleges in the first year have been suecessfully carried on in
this school, and in some instances the colleges have accepted
this work in place of similar work required in the freshman
vear, thus giving the advantage of broader choice of electives by the student when he goes to eollege. This statement is exemplified more particularly in the department of
mathematies, where the work for admission to technical
schools taken in the dast year is quite similar to the work in
the liberal arts college given in the freshman year. Some
students entering the liberal arts college while taking the
preparatory course have covered freshman. mathematics.
The work in this subject could be further’ broadened and
expanded so as to include all of the work in the freshman
vear and later, that of the college sophomore year. In the
same way the other college preparatory departments could
be expanded and modified. In order to be accepted as a

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
junior college, it would be necessary for the students to do
the work in classes made up entirely of junior college
pupils, and the organization of the school would have to be
so effected as to give such students hours when they would
not be associated too closely with our regular high school
pupils.

There are no obstacles that cannot be surmounted both
in the arrangement of the work in this school, and in the
acceptance of the colleges of the work done in junior college in Holyoke. The cost of instruction would be about the
only additional expense, and this, of course, would be higher
per capita than it now is in the High School. As to the arrangement of rooms, the laboratories, and their equipment,
I believe that some comparatively inexpensive changes are
all that are needed and eould be easily provided for. In
some states tuition fee is charged, which, in part, pays the
expenses of the junior college, but this would not recom- |
mend, except for non-resident pupils.

Amone the reasons advanced for the establishment. of
junior colleges in other places that would apply equally as
well to Holvoke are:

 Desire of parents to keep children at home.

 To provide eompletion school for those who ean
go no further. )

 Desire of students to secure college work at home.

 To meet the entrance requirements of professional
schools.

®. Financial difficulty in maintaining four year collece course.

A tabulation of the courses of study in junior colleges
now in existence shows the ten subjects that rank the highest

in selection made by the pupils, which are: English, History,
Mathematics, Chemistry, French, German, Economies, Span| ish, Physics, and Latin. As most of the courses taken by

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
our pupils when they enter the liberal arts college are made
up of subjects taken from the English, History, Mathematics,
and foreign language groups, these subjects then would be
a basis for the establishment of courses in junior college
. should one be organized in Holyoke. shall later call this
matter more definitely to your attention, and also to the
attention of the school committee.

The list of honor pupils as given in the commencement
program is printed in another part of this volume. High
honors were awarded to nine members of the class, Marion
Clare Morris standing first. pleasant custom was established by the giving to each honor pupil suitable pin, gold
for the high honor and silver for the seeond honor pupils.
Members of our athletic teams have for number of years
been awarded emblems in consideration of their skill in eontests where physical strength and alertness were needed. It
is no more than just that the pupils who maintain the standing cf our school and who are faithful and diligent in all of
their school tasks should Hkewise ive an award showing
the appreciation of the school for scholarship.

The following changes have been made in our teaching
force: Mr. Rufus W. Clement, head of the Commercial Department, asked for year’s leave of absence for further
study. Mr. Earl J. Tripp was appointed Acting Head of
this department, and Miss May M. Austin, teacher of
several years’ experience, was appointed to assist in the
feaching of the Commercial Department. Mr. William Peck
was made Head of the History Department, and Miss Bessie
MeGuines sucded Mrs. Stedman as teacher of Domestic
Science.

In the Enehlsh department several important changes
have been made. The chief aim of the English department
has been to strenethen the pupil in his ability to speak and
to write; in other words, to help him master the ‘‘tools’’ of
English. In order to aeeomplish this end better, literature
and composition have been put into separate courses, in

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
place of having composition, rhetoric, grammar, and literature on the various days of the same week. For the semester
of February .to June,  nine weeks will be devoted to
composition and nine weeks to literature in each English
class. During the next school year,  we plan to
have twenty weeks’ work in composition and twenty weeks’
work in literature. This does not mean that the pupil will
write theme every day. This would result in monotony.
The work will be varied by reading selections to see how
prominent modern authors sucd, by exercises to correct
faulty sph, by grammar work, and by oral compositions.
It is felt that the new method will cause concentration on
one thing at time, which is impossible under the usual
method of changing one’s aim every day. This new plan of
differentiation of composition and literature courses is rommended by the National Couneil of English Teachers.

In order to strengthen further the pupil in the mastery
of his mother tongue, more oral compositions are being de+
manded from him. Ability to use good everyday sph is
considered most fundamental.

Another very important change which has been made is

the introduetion of more of the modern American literature.
The e@lassies have not been displaced and will never be disPlaced, but it has been thought advisable not to neglect
utterly the great contemporary literature. Accordingly,
books: like Helen Keller’s ‘‘Story of My Life’? and Booker
T. Washington's ‘‘Up From Slavery’’ have been introduced
into the literature courses. In addition to this, every pupil
in the third and fourth years buys for himself every week
oY Month modern periodical and uses it in the class room. ,
The Atlantic, Independent, Harper's, Literary Digest, and
Outlook are the mavazines most in use. The results are very
Mportant. From this work the pupil learns how to get
difficult thought from the page, he learns to have opimuions
and to express them.

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

The work of the clubs connected with the school has
been placed on more satisfactory basis. Like last year the
meetings of these organizations have been held at time
when many classes omitted and large number of pupils
were free. year’s program has been outlined giving dates
for all of the meetings of the organizations and responsibility
placed for the arrangement and carrying out of definite prepared programs under the direction of teachers. With such
a plan the work of the clubs, while voluntary, is of great
value to its members, and believe in all respects as important as much of the regular school work.

That the general work of the public schools must be
arranged so as to meet present day demands there is no |
question. Education must be democratic, practical, and effective. We must have our school life tie up to the life of 
the eosmmunity, and we should ever be seeking to modify
and improve our methods and the content of the work.

Very respectfully yours,
HOWARD CONANT,
Principal.

PART V.
REPORTS OF SUPERVISORS OF
SPECIAL DEPARTMENTS.

This seetion of the annual volume is devoted to excerpts
from reports of the supervisors of special departments. Additionally the reports of the Principal of the Evening High
School, of the Supervisor of Garden Work, and of the
Schoolhouse Agent are included in this part.

The Supervisor of Manual Training, Robert E. Hamill,
hes made the following report :

“Work in Manual Training in the Public Schools of Holyoke  s
following the lines laid down few years ago, when re-organization
ef the work took place. The situation then faced required definition

, of our aims and development of equipment to meet the new needs.
We were led to believe that the greatest good could be obtamed by
breaking away from the existing type of sloyd work, where the project on which the pupil worked was designed primarily to afford a
means of teaching tool processes and operations. Little or no thought
was given to the personal, home, community or school need that the
project furnished. Almost in line with this type of work, but coming a
little later. was the Manual Training in which nothing was made in the
shop except those articles that satisfied one of these needs. In practice
school, the shops were turned into repair shops for old furniture, or
very inferior school equipment was built to last short time and give a
shorter period of satisfaction. We were fortunate in taking our stand
at the beginning with the newer Manual Training and subsequent
events have confirmed our choice. Manual Training as now taught in
this department aims to give an opportunity to each pupil in the upper
grammar grades to work in several different materials, with the hope
that he may better be able to become acquainted with his own possibilities and limitations as well as those of the materials with which he
works.

| REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
|
| The three important changes necessary to the development of a
| satisfactory department were: change in time schedule; adequate
) equipment, and new course of study. These have been taken up one
| at time in the course of the past few years, and all have been prop| erly adjusted, so that our way seems clear to make the few additions
necessary to teach good work, metal work, printing, cement work, and
| mechanical drawing, in each center.
| more satisfactory standard of work has been attained, and in
this connection striking conclusion has been drawn. Pupils whose
| Previous training has been in variety of materials, even where a
greater time has not been awarded the subjects, approach their High
, School shop work with better grasp of the problem as whole; and
' they make better showing of ability than those who formerly worked |
much longer on the same type of tool operations in only one material.
! We see no reason why this increased ability to grasp the problem, and
the confidence to apply what knowledge the pupil may possess will not
} carry over into the trade or the occupation which the pupil may enter.
While it is early, with the data at hand, to make an accurate statement, we believe that we are developing in our pupils better understanding of what may be expected of them when they leave us to enter the industrial life of the community.

Among the many interesting projects carried out in the Manual
Training shop the past year were several boxes of toys for the Holyuke Day Nursery, done as Junior Red Cross work.

We plan, during the coming year, to install printing equipment
at the Lawrence School, where case stands, cabinets, etc., are already
being built by the classes in wood-work. At the Morgan School the
drawing tables and seats for classes in Mechanical Drawing have been
built by the pupils.”

The supervisor of the Household Arts department, Miss
Teresa L. Dowd, has reported in part as follows:

“The work in Sewing in the Household Arts department has made
marked progress during the past year, both in the senior and junior departments. Several hundred garments have been made, including entire secs of underwear, dresses of silk, satin and serge, separate skirts,
waists and bathrobes. Twelve girls made their Class Day dresses.

Material left from Red Cross work of last year is being made into
garments for the children in our schools, who lack the necessary clothing to come to school. Eighteen petticoats and four dresses, made by
the pupils of the Morgan School. and eight dresses made by
the pupils of the High School, were given out before Christmas. The

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
Pupils in the other Junior High schools are now working on garments
Which will be distributed as soon as finished.

In some of our schools the teachers have great difficulty in getting
the children to bring material to work on. would suggest that part
Cf the Thanksgiving fund be used to buy material, in order to carry
On the work of making garments for the needy. This would also
furnish work for pupils who cannot always get material when needed.
Thus they will not fall behind the work of the class.

Many pupils leave school at the age of fourteen and before they
Feach the seventh grade. would, therefore, urged that Sewing be
taught in the sixth and, in some schools, in the fifth grades.

We should go even farther in this department by having properly
€quuipped cooking rooms and laundry in each school. small apartment or suite of rooms should be furnished, where girls could do practical work in household management. One room could be used for the
Present, representing in turn the various rooms of house. dining
room, however, used only as such, is valuable in teaching the proper
f tarnishings, the care of dining room and the proper methods of servimg meals. This room should be used by the pupils in giving luncheons,
Small dinners and teas on special occasions.

“If the schedule for Sewing could be arranged so that pupils would
Work two periods day, for two days week, better work could be
dene. The maximum number of pupils in class should be twenty£ our. .

“The teachers in the Highland and Morgan schools are working
tander difficulties, which have been referred to so often that need not
 into detail.”

The following excerpts are from the report of the Supervisor of, Drawing, Mrs. Isabelle II. Ferry:

“The work in my department is progressing satisfactorily from
Grades to VI inclusive. think that our arrangement of having the
two subjects, namely Drawing and Manual Training, taught by the
Same person is particularly good, because the two subjects can be so
Closely correlated.

“Beyond Grade VI the work is not so satisfactory. It is impossible,
with the small amount of time at our disposal, to do the kind of work
that should be done in our upper grades. Too little time is devoted to
the subject af Drawing, in these grades.

“There are other obstacles, as well as the lack of time. In the
Junior High Schools almost all other subjects are planned and taught
on departmental basis. In Drawing the supervisors’ work must be

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

supplemented by the different regular teachers. It seems to me that no
subject, in the whole school curriculum, demands expert teaching more
than Drawing requires. It requires many years of special study to become an expert in Drawing and Painting. The regular grade teacher
cannot be expected to have had this training. In the lower grades this
does not matter so much because the work is less advanced. Expert
teaching is needed in the upper grades.

“One of Springfield’s Junior High schools has two special Drawing teachers constantly in the building, and these two women are graduates of Normal Art or other Art schools, who have had long and
thorough training for their work. They also have rooms, specially
equipped for the Drawing classes, to which pupils pass for their lessons. think similar arrangements are being made in most places
where the Junior High system has been adopted. We cannot hope to
accomplish in Drawing what is being done in other places, unless conditions here can compare favorably with theirs.

“As relief from the disadvantages under which we are now laboring, would suggest that another person be engaged for the department of drawing to assist Mrs. Dougherty in taking care of the
Junior High school work, and that these two teachers take entire
charge of the drawing in the Junior High schools, relieving the regular
teachers of all responsibility concerning it. This is done as regards
Sewing, Cooking and Manual Training. Why should Drawing not have
an equal chance? .

“It seems extremely important that now, while the Junior High
school schedule is still in the experimental stage, adequate provision

' should be made for the art education of the pupils in the Holyoke
Junior High schools.
“Tf appear overzealous in this matter please ascribe it to my intense interest in the subject.”
e
The Supervisor of Penmanship, Miss Esther A. Mac| Donnell has muide the following report, in part:

“We have continued to use the Palmer Method of Writing and
have aimed to do justice to its principles. What we have put most
stress upon has been the application of correct movement to our general written work. few moments preceding each exercise have been
taken, to impress pupils with the importance of the application of the —
principles taught during the specific writing lesson. These principles
are freedom, fair degree of speed and legibility. Also we have endeavored to systematize the work so that each grade covers certain
number of exercises. As the lessons are perfected they are kept in

é

 REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
portfotio form, and pupils are required to bring them intact to the incoming grade. This does away with useless repetition. All such work
Is inspected by the Supervisor and certain average given. In the
lower grades blackboard practice has been encouraged to secure better
form and also to give courage. Teachers also have been requested to
piace the best possible writing on the board for the edification of their
pupils. In many buildings some excellent Composition and Language
work has been shown.

“I would deem it favor if some high grade paper could be procured for future use in this work, so that the writing might have a
suitable setting. In closing, wish to thank those associated with me
in my work, for their courtesy and willing assistance.”

The following is major part of the report of Mr. Hugh
Cr ie, Supervisor of Musie:

“The work of the elementary grades is very satisfactory. We use
as text-book ‘The American Music Reader.’ We use individual exercises to develop proficiency in reading music at sight.

“In the Junior High schools, both teachers and pupils are laboring under great disadvantage in having but one forty-minute period.
weekly. No lasting benefit can be derived by taking lesson once a
week and not practicing for another week until next lesson is given.

“In grades and  we are introducing three and four-part sing: ing, so am not asking too much when request sixty minutes weekly,
divided into two or three periods. In four of the grammar schools
there is an orchestra. They are doing very well, and are aiding in developing community spirit. Concerts have been given by the orchestras and choruses from the schools in each district. They were very
successful. During the year have conducted several community sings
in the school buildings.

“In the High School this last year the music has been mostly
patriotic. The assembly singing, which comes twice week, has greatly
improved this year, since each pupil has been supplied with singing
book the work at times has been inspiring. Our chorus classes have
done excellent work, as was shown at the graduation exercises. We
are now about ready to render the cantata, ‘The Rose Maiden,’ by
Cowan, which will be given on February  .

, “The Boys’ Glee Club has also been prominent in giving enjoyment to the school, and at the community sings which conducted in
the city. The High School orchestra is rendering good service to the
school.”

" REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
Principal P. J. Garvey of the Evening High School, has
presented the following report of progress:

“The enrollment during the past term was increased materially by |
the return of our soldiers from overseas. The courses of study have |
been somewhat enlarged, and five additional classes were opened shortly
after the beginning of school in October.

“There was no demand for German. The Physics course was :
discontinued early in the fall term for lack of sufficient patronage.
The interest and attendance of pupils in the other classes have been
well sustained. The Mathematics course has shown material improvement, the class in Algebra having done excellent work. One hundred
and sixty students were enrolled for the work in Stenography and
Typewriting and one hundred and ten students in Bookkeeping and
Commercial Arithmetic.

“At the present time we have about thirty students doing -work in
Advanced Bookkeeping and Advanced Commercial Arithmetic. The
present text-book in Bookkeeping is not wholly satisfactory, and, although there has been recent revision of this text. the revised book is
apparently not suited to Evening School work, as it is written with the
idea of being used by classes where the class method of instruction
can be followed. In Evening School work it is practically impossible
tu use the class method of instruction. The individual method must be
followed.

“This year Basketry has been started in connection with the Free
Hand Drawing course. Although it would be quite practical to combine class in Design with the work in Basketry, the Free Hand Drawing class as it stands now has so little in common with Basketry that
another year should see them separated entirely. There was large
enrollment in the Basketry division, and it was necessary to divide the
class, thus making two classes, each meeting one night week. This
has been rather an attractive course and has been well attended by the
more mature pupils.

“The class in Mechanical Drawing has been conducted under great
difficulties this year, as well as last year, owing to the lack of textbooks and instruments, and the lack of proper storage space for material. Under present conditions it is practically impossible to keep
track of material given out to students. We have planned to remedy ,
this to some extent next term, by having the Manual Training department provide us with cabinet. The need of text-books is becoming
more apparent each year. The difference in the degree of education
and the aptitude of the pupils, and the variety of purpose for which

\

, REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
they are taking the course makes class instruction impossible, while individual explanations take more of the teachers’ time than is available.
I. therefore, strongly recommend that number of copies of two or
three different texts be procured. Orders were placed early in the year
for considerable number of supplies, but up to the present time only a
small part of this material has been received, due largely to market
conditions. We cancelled the order for Drawing instruments, as the
price was exceptionally high. At the present time the class have absolutely no instruments, and progress is, consequently, retarded.

“Early in the term class in General Cooking was opened as an
Evening High School course. This was pleasing to me personally, as
there has been for some time strong demand for it. Many women of
the city wish to pursue the course in General Cooking, and yet do not
care to confine themselves to the unit system of the Vocational School.
It was intended to open one class of not over fifteen members, to meet
two evenings per week, but so many applied that it was necessary to
form second class, and there is even now waiting list. These classes
are well organized under the supervision of woman who is not only
a practical cook, but an experienced teacher as well. The girls have )
purchased their own text-books, and the total expense of conducting
the class thus far has been very small. The course has definite aim
and covers eight breakfasts, twelve dinners, twelve luncheons, eight
mid-summer luncheons and dinners, with instructions as to costume,
personal habits, placing of supplies, table setting and service, care of
equipment, sanitation, food values, economy, table decorations, assignments and table etiquet. Among the members are domestics, young
women who anticipate marriage, housekeepers and others who, while
engaged in ofhces or shops during the day, have been obliged to assume
the management of the home through the death of mother or for
some other reason.

“In view of the success of this course would strongly urge a
c'ass in General Sewing to be opened as an Evening High School
course next year.

“The opening of these courses should not be construed in any sense
as conflicting with the work of the Vocational School. On the contrary, it is simply satisfying demand for certain kind of instruction which the latter school, from the nature of its courses and its recuirements, does not supply. |

“Perhaps the most noticeable feature of the work of the Evening
High School during the past year was the success of the course in
Americanization and Citizenship. Last year we conducted one class in
Citizenship and one class in English for non-English speaking people.

 

. é
  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
This year the work of this department. has been broadened out, and
with the excellent supply of text-books and material which has been
furnished us, we have conducted five classes under the general head
of Americanization. Three of these classes meet twice week for the
study of Citizenship, which covers the fundamentals of Federal, state
and city government, the important historical items of the country,
tiames and duties of the officers of the government, etc. We have two
classes in our English for the non-English speaking, which are doing
excellent work. One hundred and twenty men and three women have
been enrolled for these courses. Debates have been held between members from the different classes and mock registration court has also
been conducted with the principal and teachers acting as court officials.
A study of the city and its institutions has been made, different groups
from the classes have been conducted through the police building, fire
headquarters, public library, gas and electric department and around
the reservoirs. City officials have been invariably courteous and glad
to help us. We are indebted to the Water Commissioners and the
Superintendent of Water Supply for conveyances to the various reservoirs. We are, likewise, indebted to the officials of the Police Department, Fire Department, Gas and Electric Department and Librarian.
The course is being conducted through co-operation with the United
States Department of ‘Labor, and graduates receive diplomas upon completion of the work.

“The graduates of this department will be combined with the
senior class of the Evening High School and receive their diplomas at
the close of the school year.

“I wish to register my personal appreciation for the splendid manner in which our requisitions for text-books and supplies have been
handled. With the single exception of the Mechanical Drawing course
we have had excellent service.”

In  Holyoke again ‘‘carried on’’ its Home, School
and Civie Gardens. These are operated by Joint Committee from the School Board and the Chamber of Commerce, and are State-aided. An order of the Board of
Aldermen permits the School Board to finance these gardens
as unit. Thus the City receives back from the State twothirds of all expenses for salaries, because the garden project
is considered vocational agricultural department of the
High School. The entire garden work of the City is, in this

' way, finaneed each year with the amount of money that was

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS |
annually required for the home and school gardens alone.
The following are excerpts from the report of the Supervisor, Mr. George D. Hearn, on Home and School Gardens:

“That the Home and School Garden work has had another successful season ts shown by the following brief, but pertinent facts:

“A special feature of the exhibit this year was the introduction of
poultry and rabbits. window display of dozen different varieties of
peppers made very attractive educational feature.

“The canning work was conducted along the lines which proved so

 successful last year. very creditable season’s work was accomplished,
as marked by the activity at the six different canning centers and the
final exhibit.”

The Schoolhouse Agent, Mr. Cadieux, has presented the
following report:

“The work in general in this department has gone along smoothly.
The janitors for the most part have done their work conscientiously
and well. .

“The death of Mr. Michael J. Moriarty, one of our most faithful
janitors, necessitated the transfer of Mr. Daniel Kennedy from the
High School to the Sargeant Street School. Mr. H. A. Peterson was
engaged to replace Mr. Kennedy at the High School, and, so far, his
work has given entire satisfaction.

“Our relations with the Board of Public Works have been very unsatisfactory. The Board of Public Works has been very lax in its
maintenance of the schoo! buildings, and on many occasions the School
Department has been obliged to pay for urgent repairs which should

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

have been taken care of by the Board. Extraordinary repairs were
made at the Highland, Elmwood, Park and Morgan Schools. At the
Park Street School, all the furniture in four rooms was repaired. New
treads are needed for the stairs. This building was so crowded that
we had to make three small classrooms out of dressing rooms. At the
Elmwood School, some of the furniture was repaired. The heating
plant in this school is still inadequate, although small boiler was installed as an addition to the heating apparatus. The plant is still insufficient to heat the northwest of the building. larger boiler is
needed; also new floors in the boys’ sanitaries.

, “Throughout the South Chestnut Street School new windows and
blackboards are needed. This building is still without lights, and it is
strongly recommended that the Board of Public Works install electric
lights. In the Lawrence School, new blackboards are needed in one
room, and electric lights for the whole building. The Ewingville

School needs new windows. Double windows are needed for the
northwest side of the Kirtland School. New doors are needed in the
rear of the Joseph Metcalf School. At the Hamilton Street School
some of the furniture was repaired. few of the rooms are badly in
need of paint. At the High School, new curtains were purchased for
one side of the building and other curtains should be supplied during
the coming year. From the Sargeant Street School the following
requisitions have been sent in: New set of rocker grates for fire box;
extension of electric wiring in basement; steam radiator for boys’ sanitaries; repairs on damper regulator. The walls of some rooms of the
Springdale School need painting. fence between the school property
and the neighboring property is recommended. Grates for the boiler
are necded. The basement should be whitewashed, and an emergency
tcilet should be provided on the second floor. The roof of the West
Street School needs repairing. The interior of the building and the
window sashes should be painted. Furniture for grade is needed,
and the railing from the auditorium should be strengthened.”

The work of the Department of School Hygiene is reported under three heads. For the Health Division Dr. —
Harold E. Miner as Medical Director, has submitted report

which includes statements from his assistant physicians, as
well as from the School Nurse.

Mr. Louis K. Appel has submitted report covering the
division and the duties assigned to him, namely supervision
of the entire course of study in Hygiene and direction of
Physical Education in the grades below the High School. REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

Mr. John P. Whalen, Director of Physical Education at

the High School submits his report whieh covers work in

- Physical Education for all the students of the High School.
Dr. Miner writes in part:

“The year has been marked by considerable progress in the
medical division of the Department of School Hygiene. Just year
ago we were busily engaged in the fight against influenza. During the
early part of the year this so engrossed our attention that much anticipated work along other lines had to be postponed for the time being.
In fact, problems relating to the management of contagious diseases
and vaccinations take up so much of our time as to encroach heavily
on the time needed for other work.

“The importance of Health and Physical Education has been espe
cially emphasized since the close of the World War. Numerous organizations throughout the country have been formed to promote the work.
Especially has the attention of the nation been directed to our school
children, and the importance of prevention medicine has been recognized.

“Our special activities along this line are at present directed to the
making of an exhaustive survey of the physical condition of all school
children, both public and parochial. Weighing and measuring, studying
the conditions of the tonsils and teeth, and examining for the presence
of adenoids and nasal growths are our present special objectives. This
data, which we are card-indexing, will be of the greatest help to us.
This, of course, will take some time to complete, but rapid progress  s
being made. Once having this data we can intelligently bend our efforts to the alleviation of these conditions.

“Our work, although separated from that of the Physical Education division as concerns management. has been correlated, to certain
extent, through the earnest co-operation of the directors of physical
education.

“The general health of our school children has been very good,
with the exception of almost continuous epidemics of colds. All seem
to be especially susceptible since the influenza of last fall. Increased
efforts to build up resistance and strict obedience to our health axioms
will, think, improve this. The number of cases of contagious diseases has been about normal, scarlet fever predominating especially
during the past few months. Throughout the State, scarlet fever has
been epidemic, and has called for special efforts on the part of State
Board of Health. An important step forward during the past year
was made by the local Board of Health in changing the quarantine

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

regulations so that only the tenement where contagious disease exists

is Quarantined. It is also of interest to note that terminal fumigation

of these cases has been discontinued and the soap and water method !
substituted. The methods employed in the management of contagious ,
cases by our staff continue the same as formerly, namely cleaning the !
schoolroom, followed by repeated examinations for evidence of the disease in other children. Recent studies by experts on contagious diseases lead to the conviction that scarlet fever is contracted to great

extent through food and drink and not always by personal contact.

“The regular medical inspections have progressed as in former
years. Schools have been visited regularly. number of pupils have
been excluded for evidence of contagious disease, and many have been
advised as to the proper treatment for numerous conditions.

“Over children were vaccinated in the past year by the school
physicians. This work is done largely in the fall and taxes our time
to great extent during this period. We feel that the children in the
schools of Holyoke are protected to large degree from smallpox.

“The physical examinations of all pupils in the High School were
furnished during the early fall. The general condition of the pupils
remains good. The examination of children in the grades with the
making out of life cards has progressed as formerly. Many defects,
such as adenoids and enlarged tonsils, were noted, and the parents
notified.

“This department correlates its work with that of the attendance
department in the issuing of working certificates. Over examinations were made by our staff during the past year.

“I herewith append the report of my assistant, Dr. Honoria K.
Shine:

“During one year made the regular routine physical examinations of all the girls of the High School. The examinations in the Parochial High Schools were somewhat curtailed owing to lack of time.
“*The work in the High School is more satisfactory this year than
ever before, since all four classes are obliged to include two hours of

gymnasium in their regular schedule. This enables me to have, in addition to the physical examinations, systematic medical inspection of all
the girls. find this very beneficial in arousing an interest in the care
of the feeble. It is interesting to note that of the four hundred and
thirty-five girls whom have examined, one hundred and twelve have
defective teeth in varying degrees of decay. Of this number twenty have
had dental treatment since September, and believe that before the end
of the year more than half of the number will have had treatment. I

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
, think dental clinic for the lower grades would solve to great extent one problem of defective teeth in High School pupils.

““Since last January seven girls have had operations for the removal of adenoids and tonsils which caused difficult breathing and frequent sore throats. One girl was operated on for ear trouble. There
were sixty-six cases of influenza during the epidemic, but there have
been no serious after effects. As result of the examinations have
ninety-four cases of follow-up work with the under-nourished and special exercise groups—besides the cases of defective teeth, and cases
which are referred from time to time.

“The work has been very interesting during the year, and especially so because of the new physical examination cards and the hearty
co-operation of all connected with the physical education department.’

“T herewith append the report of Bess Sullivan, school nurse:

“*The work of the school nurse may be divided into two important
branches: School Nursing and Social Welfare. These have been closely
correlated, and much good has been accomplished.

“During the past year the schools in the congested section of the
city have been visited weekly, and many special calls have been made to
other schools.

“The regular weekly visit has taken the form of .a clinic where
children have been examined and treated under the supervision of the
school physicians. On the average to children have been treated
daily.

““Afternoons have been devoted to home visits, supervising special sight and hearing examinations, giving of baths, and assisting |
school physicians with vaccinations and physical examinations.

““In my visits to the homes have found number of worthy
families in need, and through the generous co-operation of the St.
Agnes and Needlework Guilds, Associated Charities, Relief Department and other friends, have been able to give relief in many cases.

“ ‘Arrangements have been made for the examination and fitting
of thirty children for glasses. For this am deeply indebted to Drs.
Potts, Powers, Bouvier and Hussey, who have given much of. their
time to this work. also wish to acknowledge the co-operation of
Miss Mary McMahon, Policewoman, who has rendered assistance in
several cases of neglect which have come to my attention.’

“Your Medical Director offers for your consideration the following recommendations:

“I. The engaging of another school nurse to enlarge the work
already started.

/
  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
“II. That start be made toward dental clinic.

“ITI. That some provision be made for the treatment of worthy
children suffering from adenoids and diseased tonsils.

“In conclusion allow me to express my appreciation to all members of the School Department and the Board of Health for their help
and co-operation in our work.” |

Mr. Louis K. Appel submits his annual report for the |
year of  which is published in full: |

“The work in Physical Education in the grades has been conducted along the lines mapped out in previous years. The teaching
force remains the same as that of last year, namely, Miss Ruth Yoerg
(full time), and Miss Mary V. Cronin (part time). Additional games,
song plays, and industrial activities have been added to the course of
study. Folk-Dancing has now become well established phase of the
department’s activities. Very little formal setting-up work is done in

| the first two grades. In the third grade beginning is made, and in |
the fourth grade movements are executed with precision on command
and in rhythm.

“The work in,the Grammar Schools and Junior High Schools has
been personally conducted by the Director. As supplement to the regular classroom activities, the Director, in his visits, uses the auditoriums. He substitutes for the ordinary program of setting-up exercises and active games, tactics, free-exercises that cannot be done in
the schoolroom, folk and character dances, and games suitable for the
playground.

“The Public Schools’ Athletic League furnishes the basis for athletic activities. The baseball and soccer games are in charge of Mr. |
Thomas Finn, who has shown unusual ability in handling boys and in
teaching them the lesson of ‘Playing Fair”. The Metcalf School won
the baseball championship, and the Morgan School the soccer championship. gratifying improvement has been noticed in the averages
attained by the boys in the Physical thciency Test. which consists of
the three events: Chinning, Dash and Broad Jump. The schools finished as follows: Grammar Schools: Lawrence,  West.  ;
Metcalf,  Morgan,  Highland,  Primary Schools:
Springdale, Ingleside,  Sargeant,  Kirtland,  ;
Hamilton,  Elm, South Chestnut,  Nonotuck, }
Whiting,  .

“The Lawrence School, having won the cup three times, has come
into permanent possession of the cup awarded the winner.

| REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
“The Efficiency Tests have been extended to the girls. They were
conducted by Misses Yoerg and Cronin. Considering the fact that this
was the first year that the test was put in operation, the results were
all that could be expected. Results:

“Grammar Schools: West,  Metcalf, Lawrence, ;
Highland,  Morgan,  .

“Primary Schools: South Chestnut,  Springdale,  Kirtland, Hamilton,  Elm,  Sargeant, Ingleside, ;
Whiting, Nonotuck,  |

“The Outdoor Athletic Meet was likewise extended to include the
girls. The Hampden playgrounds were used. The entire department,
assisted by class leaders.of the High School, volunteered their services
to make the mect success. There were close to entries. Results:

“As regards extension work in Physical Education, these points are
important:

“The gymnasium and swimming classes for Grade IX have been
conducted as in previous years. The large attendance is the best indication of the success of these classes. .

“An effort is being made at the Highland School under the direction of Principal Fred Baldwin to conduct the outdoor recesses so as to )
have the pupils devote the time to organized play under the direction
of their self-elected class leaders. With an increase in the time alIctted to the outdoor recess period, the plan will speedily pass through
the experimental stage. The result of this experiment should serve as
a guide for utilizing the recess period in other schools.

“Several bicycle clubs have been organized in the schools. They
participated in the First Annual Bicycle Meet given under the auspices
of Charles Walker Co., and took large'share of the prizes.

“During the winter months, the gymnasium pays its dividends
through use. It is occupied every evening: The Evening High School,
Day High School and Parochial Schools have organized games and
classes. The Swimming Pool is as popular as ever, an average of
twenty classes using it weekly throughout the year.

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

“Instruction in the subject of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine is
given at the High School by the Director. All freshmen are required
to take part in the weekly lectures, discussions and recitations. The
most essential topics in health are covered. !

“The course in Hygiene for Junior High Schools and grades, i
worked out recently by the various committees appointed by the Super- ,;
intendent, will be shortly placed in the hands of the teachers. The

. courses of study emphasize the cultivation of Health Habits, rather
than mere knowledge of the vital problems and essential principles
connected with the subject of Health. Although the teachers have not
had any definite course of study up to this time, they have had ample
literature and text-books, from which they could select material for
their lessons. The purpose of the new course of study is merely to
Standardize, in measure, the subject matter taught.

It has been forcitly brought to our realization that no nation can
be strong and powerful unless it takes care of the health of its people.
As educators, we should impress this fact upon our pupils and should
improve their health by putting into effect all those forces which make
for health.”

Mr. John P. Whalen, Director of Physical Education at
High School, writes:

“Since the adoption of the rule for compulsory Physical Education for the entire four years at the High School, there has been a
large attendance at all classes. Much more enthusiasm has been shown.

“The work has consisted of marching, calisthenics, apparatus work,
games, athletics and aquatics. Regular gymnasium classes report twice
a week. portion of one period week for each class is devoted to
aquatics. Each boy is required to show that he is capable of swimming
a certain distance. Special instruction is given to those who cannot
swim. An interclass swimming meet was held, and from this an
aquatic team has been formed. During gymnasium classes, games are
held and are varied as the class develops. These games are taught to
develop poise, co-operation, skill, quick-thinking, self-control and lead- |
ership. ,

“Many more boys report for various athletic teams which are developed during the year. Scholastic rules are strictly adhered to in the
make-up of these teams. Self-control and fairness are the elements
drilled into candidates along with team play and individual skill.
Throughout the year interclass games and athletic meets in the various
sports are held. These create much interest and afford an opportunity
to the boys who cannot play with the representative teams.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

“Physical Training for girls at the High School during the past

year comsisted, as formerly, of marching, tactics, graded exercises with

and without hand apparatus, apparatus work, folk and aesthetic dancing, garmes of low organization, and swimming during class periods.

Inthe afternoon more time was provided for games of higher organization zamd£ special hours designated for additional practice in swimming, Glarncing, and apparatus for those desiring it.

“Fromm January to June the work was compulsory for two years
only. AX third year of more advanced work was provided for third
and fo.arth-year girls interested. Thirty-four were enrolled. With the
openings of schools in September, Physical Training became compulsory
for fourar years. This change increased the enrollment in physical
trainin gx classes considerably—from two hundred twenty-one to three
hindre@ci  minety-seven. This figure is somewhat lower than the enrollnent Of girls in the High School, as post-graduates and those taking
special part-time courses are not enrolled. It also excludes those excued Om the work upon presentation of certificate from the famlly phy Sician.

“Upon recommendation of the school physician, Dr. Shine, some :
of the szirls are excused from the more strenuous compulsory gymnasiurya Work or swimming. Dr. Shine found, upon examination, many
girls Who were in need of special work. Classes in corrective gymnascs Were arranged for these. The work was voluntary, and no credit
given fOr the additional time, yet the attendance was good,—forty-two
girls reporting regularly from January till June. Upon later examinaton. Dr. Shine noted improvement in almost every case.

“Special attention is now being given the physical welfare of the
High chool girls through frequent medical inspection of an entire
class. Better care of teeth, hands, and hair is urged, and improvement
watched for from one inspection to another.

. “Although there are four classes now reporting for Physical Training, fOurth year course has not yet been put in operation. This was
inadvisable this year, inasmuch as many fourth-year girls had not had
a third year of Physical Training, and because of the heavy schedules
carried. by most seniors it was impossible to segregate those who had
time. Another year four definite courses should be in operation for
 the four School years, giving an opportunity for more varied and advanced work
“Of the two periods per week devoted to Physical Training, one
consists entirely of work in the gymnasium, the other in the swimming
pool. ‘With third and fourth-year course in swimming, believe the
tests In life-saving provided by the ‘World’s Life-Saving Alliance,’ for

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

girls might well be established as part of the work. These tests correspond to those given by the ‘Red Cross’ to men and boys, and entitle
the successful contestant to diploma and the privilege of wearing
the honor emblem of the organization. Instruction in life-saving is
now given by Miss McCaffrey to the more competent swimmers.”

REPORT OF ATTENDANCE
OFFICERS.
To the Superintendent of Schools:
|  The report of the attendance officers for the school vear
which ended on June is herewith submitted. It is
the forty-fifth annual report of this department.

There were employment certificates issued to  
different persons between fourteen and sixteen years of age,
as against employment certificates issued to different individuals during the preceding twelve months. This
shows much needed let-up in the drain made upon the
school population to supply labor.

From September to June twelve summonses were served for cases of truancy. Four of these
boys were probated, and their cases continued from time to
time throughout the year. They were finally discharged.
Eight boys were ecommitted to the Training School in
Agawam. At this time eleven boys from this city are at the
Hampden County Training School.

From January  to December this department issued educational certificates to literate
minors between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one; also  
edueational certificates to illiterate minors between the same
age limits. These, together with employment certificates issued, make total of certificates of all kinds

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
issued during the calendar year of  The attendance
officers made night calls in connection with day school
work, and calls for the evening schools.
