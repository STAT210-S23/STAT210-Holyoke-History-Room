FIRE ALARM TELEGRAPH.

We would repeat our recommendation of many years
passed that the wires of the Fire Alarm System be put underground in the thickly settled portions of the city. We have
been very fortunate :n the past year that no serious accident
has happened to our system, but we believe that it is wrong to carry these wires overhead any longer, and we trust that
you will make arrangements so that your Board of Fire
Commissioners can carry out this improvement in the coming
year. failure on the part of the Fire Alarm System to
properly work would be serious matter, and we have to
commend our superintendent of this department that he has
kept his apparatus in such excellent shape that we have had
no serious trouble.

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.  
CONCLUSION.

We again thank the Honorable Mayor and City Council,
the Board of Public Works, the Board of Water Commissioners, the Electric Light Department, the City Clerk, the
City Treasurer, the City Auditor, the City Marshal and
Police Officers, and all other public officers for the many
acts of consideration and courtesy they have shown us
during the past year.

And we cannot let this opportunity pass without thanking
the Street Railway Company, on behalf of the members of
the Fire Department for the continued privilege of riding
on the company’s cars when on duty, and for their willing
co-operation with the Fire Department in every way.

Respectfully yours,
: CHARLES L. NEWCOMB, 
GEORGE J. PREW,
JAMES H. O'CONNELL,
Holyoke Fire Commissioners.

 

REPORT OF THE
PARK COMMISSIONERS.
To His Honor, the Mayor, and Board uf Aldermen:

GENTLEMEN: The approaching days of the old year
reminds us of our duty to you (agreeable to the statutes),
that of rendering an account of our stewardship and presenting to you in detail the expenditure of the funds entrusted
to our care.

The success of the past year and what we have accomplished has been due in no small measure to the liberal appropriation given this department, which has our appreciation
and we trust that we have merited your confidence to the
extent, that you will again deal with us as liberally as the
finances of the City may permit.

During the past year many changes and improvements
have taken place, notably the completion of the wading
pool, tennis courts and ball fields at Riverside Park. The
athletic field at Elmwood Park—the completion of surveys
and preliminary plans for the development of Jones’ Point
and the final arrangements made with the Boston and Maine
Railroad Company regarding boundary lines of Prospect
Park, which will now enable us to complete the parapet

  REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS.
wall on that park. Details of the above are given under
the headings of their respective parks.

During the past year in order to encourage civic progress
we donated loam for the grading of the lot on south side of
the library. The purchase of the triangle at corner of Laurel
and Willow Streets, Elmwood, was consummated and this
spot will be developed during the coming season in an attractive way, much to the satisfaction of the residents in that
locality. While it is true that all these improvements and
additions cost money, nevertheless we firmly believe that
they are all of great value to the progress of our city, and
consider money well spent in such work and strongly recommend continuance of same on as liberal scale as possible.

We append herewith detailed statement of our receipts
and expenditures for the past year, together with an itemized

} account of all our disbursements, our labor account by months
and cost of improvements on each park, all of which we trust
may meet with your approval.

Below is brief resume of the different parks, together

with an account of the work aceomplished:
RIVERSIDE PARK.

This park is now justly considered ‘one of the most
important of our svstem,”’ and ts destined to soon become
the most popular owing to its size and location and the
facilities offered for athletics of all kinds. Here the most
work has been done and is now commencing to show what
a valuable addition we have. The completion of the wading

REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS.  
pool for children has been the one thing that has appealed
to the people at large, especially to parents of small children,
for it has been the means of keeping them away from the
dangerous places on the river.

The best proof we have of its popularity and usefullness
is well attested by the crowds of happy children from all
parts of the city who flock to this place to enjoy its cool and
refreshing waters. If one desires to see true childish happiness,
well illustrated, they have but to make journey to this
place on warm, summer day—there they can see from
two to three hundred children of all creeds and conditions
in life, from little tots just beginning to walk to grown up
boys and girls, enjoying themselves to their fullest extent—
their happy voices ringing out in shouts of merriment and joy
as they sport in the cooling, fresh running water. It is well
worth visit to see such happiness and no one could but help
feeling that it certainly was blessing to the people to have
such place, and be strong advocate of further development
in this direction.

' We have completed this past year one of the finest
running tracks in the State, built upon scientific principles,
it admits of as good work and records being made as any
other track. This track will be enclosed with fence and
on the inside will be established an open air gynmasium,
We now have one first-class cricket field, one ball field and
shall complete this coming summer ball field for the younger
set. We have two fine tennis courts and are very anxious
that the people should make more use of them, and we are
ready to help along their use by offering every inducement
and courtesy to our patrons. What we need at this park is a
good recreation building, shelter for the people and we are
hoping before long that the necessity for same will be so
strongly visible to our City Fathers that they will co-operate
with us in obtaining it. Development work will be pushed
along as fast as funds are available.

  REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS.
ELMWOOD PARK.

This park is practically finished as regards the Maple
Street entrance with the exception of the pool at the bottom
of the ravine, which will be completed this summer by putting
in the clay foundation so it will hold water. Further development work cannot be done until the culvert is extended
up to Pine Street. Neither can any progress be made towards
the erection of the proposed bridge until after the completion
of the culvert. It is therefore, essential that some provision
be made whereby funds would be available for this important
work. We shall continue the work of clearing away all the
underbrush and relocating the trees on the extension recently
acquired from the Hospital Association.

Now that the work of filling is completed as far as High
Street on the east side, we shall prod to develop that
portion and make it into an attractive part of the park.

HAMPDEN PARK.

This park is one of the most attractive spots in the city
and is well cared for and calls for no further expense, outside
of maintenance, with the exception, that system of drainage
should be introduced to carry away surplus water, especially
in the winter where melting snow and rain makes walking
very hard and uncomfortable. We shall leave this matter
in the hands of our city engineer for solution.

PROSPECT PARK.

This beautiful spot and famous for its magnificent views
of the surrounding country is well patronized and demands
considerable attention and an extension of same is desired
that we may provide for large concourse for the people,
whereby music may be furnished for their enjoyment, and
we also desire to enlarge the playground area.

After long period of uncertainty, we have at last made
suitable and. satisfactory arrangements with the railroad

REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS.  
company, whereby we can prod to erect the remaining
portion of the parapet wall. Plans and specifications will
be made so that we can prod with its erection early in
the coming season. We are promised co-operation on the
part of the railroad company towards improving the embankment, which when finished will add greatly to the attractiveness of the place and produce much more favorable 
impression on strangers entering the city on the trains.

CANONCHET PARK. ,

This small area is made as attractive as possible by well
kept lawns and walks and additions of shrubs, flowers and 
trees. No great amount of development work can be done
owing to its small area and existing conditions of soil.

HAMILTON PARK.

This little plot is altogether too small for the location
and in its present condition is far from being satisfactory.
It is impossible to grow grass, trees and shrubs, owing to the
large number of children living in the immediate vicinity.
It is therefore, under consideration, the advisability of making
it into playground at same time providing suitable and
sufficient resting places which can be used by the public
at large.

GERMANIA PARK.

This popular place is also too small for its location but
we see no chance for enlargement. We can therefore, only
keep it up to high standard of maintenance and provide
generously, as space will permit, resting places for the large
crowds who congregate every pleasant night in summer.

  REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS.
JONES’ POINT.

This beautiful spot  destined to become very soon one
of the most important of our park areas. Progress is being
made in its development; survevs have been made, also the
preliminary plans for its development which calls for establishment of playgrounds, athletic fields, tennis courts, boating !
facilities, driveways, shelters and lookouts, etc. When
completed it will make very attractive place and well
worth visit there. Our landscape architects expect to have
plans all completed this spring, so that if funds are available,
work can be commenced upon it this season.

ALL OTHER PARKS.

The several small areas have been attended too and are
in good condition; both Sullivan Square and Ranger Triangle
have been seeded and planted with shrubs and are very
attractive. The usual attention is promised them this coming
year.

To the Engineering Department as well as the Board
of Water Comnnussioners and Board of Public Works, do we
extend our thanks and appreciation for their assistance and
courtesy shown us.

| The following recommendations are submitted as to
the appropriations which should be made for this department |

REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS.  
In reviewing the foregoing, we ask in conclusion that due
consideration be given our requests, that as generous and
liberal sum as the City can spare be allowed for future
development work, that in view of the fact, that lands for
park purposes are getting very scarce, generous sum should
be placed at our disposal for acquiring such areas as we may
deem necessary and desirable, that we should not be hampered
in our desire to be progressive and in our ambition to make
our city one of the best, and to have system of parks of
which her citizens may justly be proud.

We regret to record the sad death of one of our members
during the past year, whose loss we keenly felt, being as he
was man of high ideas, whose heart was in his work and who 
always labored for the best interests of our good city.

We submit this report hoping it may have your approval
and consideration.

Respectfully submitted,

REPORT OF :
Gas and Electric Department.  
City OF HOLYOKE, Mass., |
OFFICE OF GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT. ;
December ,
To the Honorable, the Mayor and the Board of Aldermen: .
GENTLEMEN: hand you herewith the seventh annual
report of the Gas and Electric Department.
In the business done from the gas works, there has been |
but little change from that done in  There was sent .
out from the works cubic feet more gas, or gain
of only one and six-tenths per cent. While there has been
a good gain in the number of gas meters set, the increase in
gas consumption has not kept up, owing to the Department's
losing some mill lighting, and number of its gas customers
changing over to electric lighting. There have been  
new meters set during the year, or gain of II.  per cent.
in the total number set. There have been laid miles of
main pipe, largely eight inch upon the Springfield road.
There is total of miles of gas mains in the city. There
have also been run new service pipes. There have been
the usual repairs made, including the renewal of three benches
of retorts. There have been added to the works four new
purifiers.
At the electric station, the additions and alterations
commenced in were completed, giving the city modern
and finely equipped central station, one that can be run |
economically and made to show good results. The increased
business from it during the year has been phenominal, amounting to per cent. more than that done in  Not- |
withstanding the large additions made to the plant the past
year, if such an increase continues for the next few months,

  REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF POLICE.
it will be imperative to make further additions to the apparatus another year. During the year, there have been added
  meters to those already set, or gain of per cent.
There has been strung about miles of wire, making a
total of miles in use. There have been new poles
set. The transformers have increased in number. There
have also been added new street arc lights and incandescent street lights.

There is little to report in this department unless we ,
note the increase in the number of women arrested. regret
to say that drunkenness is the apparent cause of this increase.

Among the applicants for lodging, are many who appear
respectable and who come here looking for work. It seems
strange that there is no place in Holyoke where we can send
a woman or young girl for few davs until she finds employment.

I would again remind the charitably inclined that shall
be grateful for donations of clothing and shoes for women
and children.

I wish to thank the “Ladies of the Needle Work Guild”
for their generous gift of new garments.

In conclusion desire to thank the Marshal, his assistants
and the officers of the Police Force for their courteous treatment and willing assistance in my work.

DETECTIVE BUREAU.

The work of this branch of the service is very little
appreciated or known to the community at large. It oftens
means many hours and days of patient investigation before
any results are obtained, and the effectiveness of the labors
of this department cannot be explained in detail; they are
constantly employed in securing evidence and tracing offenders
and crime committed and all cases bound over to the Superior
Court necessarily have to be followed to that Court by the
detectives making the arrest of the accused person. And in
nearly all cases there has to be great deal of time spent
by the detectives in preparing his case for said Court. This
branch of the service is at present composed of three men,
Peter A. Cullen, Frank R. Metcalf and Maurice M. O'Connor.
the first two with the rank of Inspector, the other being

  REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF POLICE.

detailed from the ranks for special duty. Those men at the

present time receiving the same pay as the patrolmen, and I

would recommend that the City Council establish salary

of twelve hundred dollars per year for this position.
DISCIPLINE OF THE DEPARTMENT.

I wish to state at the outset that the condition of the
department is very satisfactory, the changes have been
continuous and not spasmodic and while the discipline of
the department is not by any means perfect, still believe
that after everything is taken into consideration we are
tustified in claiming that the Police Department of Holyoke
is accomplishing all that can be reasonably expected of it
under the circumstances and do not hesitate in reporting
to your honorable board that there is less crime and less
disorder existing today in our city than any manufacturing
city of the same size tn this State.

POLICE BUILDING.

I wish to call your attention to the need of new Police
building in this city. The present quarters of the Police
Department have been in use by the department since the
City Hall was finished over thirty-five years ago and has
answered all purposes until within few years: the time has
come, however, when the city should make provisions for
the erection of headquarter’s building to be used exclusively for the Police Department.

POLICE SIGNAL SYSTEM.

I wish to again remind you of the need of an up-to-date
police signal system; the present system  owned by the
New England Telephone Company and is not reliable for
use by the Police Department.

REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF POLICE  
CONCLUSION.

I again desire to express my appreciation of the ever
courteous treatment accorded me by His Honor, the Mayor,
and Judge and Clerk of the Police Court, as well as the
rank and file of this department for the ready assistance
rendered at all times in the performance of my duty.

Respectfully submitted,
THOMAS J. LYNCH,
City Marshal.

REPORT OF THE

Board of Public Works.

To the Honorable, the Mayor, and the Members of the Board
of Aldermen of the City of Holyoke, Mass.

GENTLEMEN :—Annexed hereto we beg to submit in
detail statement of the work performed by this Board during
the fiscal year of  The total expenditures for new work,
maintenance and for land purchased, amounted to four
hundred and sixty thousand, two hundred and ninety four
dollars and fourteen cents ($ ). The total appropriation granted this department from taxation at the beginning
of the fiscal year was one hundred and ninety-two thousand,
six hundred and fifty dollars ($ ), to which was
added additional appropriations of thirteen thousand one
hundred and thirtcen dollarsand seventy-twocents($ ).
Also sums derived from loans and premiums amounting to
two hundred forty-five thousand six hundred and twenty-four
dollars and eighty cents ($ ). The receipts from all
sources including the State and Street Railway Excise Taxes
and sidewalk and sewer assessments were twenty-one thousand, four hundred and seventeen dollars and one cent
($ ), to which should be added the sum of thirty-two
thousand, seven hundred and thirty-five dollars and ninetyseven cents (($ ), the balance on hand at the close of
the fiscal year of  making total of five hundred, five
thousand, five hundred and forty-one dollars and fifty cents
($ ), available to mect the needs of the various
departments under the Board. From this amount there has

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.

been carried over to the fiscal year of  thirty-seven
thousand, four hundred, forty-six dollars and thirty-one
cents ($ ), from which the Ingleside Underpass and
Ingleside School must be completed and plans prepared for
the Contagious Disease Hospital.

There is balance to the credit of the Ingleside School
account of twenty-six thousand, three hundred and twelve
dollars ($ ), the contracts having been let so late
in the season that it has been impossible to accomplish much
work. The plans for this building provide for three-room
structure with an assembly hall large enough to accommodate
the needs of this section and in planning this building the
requirements of Ingleside in the future have been safeguarded.
Standing as this building does at almost the southerly gateway
of the city and also upon commanding site, the Board
deemed it matter of wisdom to erect structure that at
first appearance will give the traveler favorable impression
of Holyoke as he enters it. This structure when finished will
be one of the best school buildings in Holyoke.

There is available, approximately two thousand dollars
($ for the preparation of plans for the Contagious
Disease Hospital, while in Permanent Highways the Board
has balance of four thousand and twenty dollars ($ ),
with which to start the work of Igto.

The largest expenditure made during the year by the
Board was one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars
($ for playgrounds and school sites, bought from
the Holyoke Water Power Company. The size and locations
of the lots are as follows:

First Plot: Bounded by Maple, Cabot, Chestnut and
Hampshire Streets and contains about one hundred, fourteen
thousand and four hundred square feet.

Second Plot: Bounded by Winter, Samosett and Pequot
Streets and the land occupied by the West Street School and
contains about cighty-cight thousand, six hundred  and
forty-seven square feet.

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.  

Third Plot: The boundary lines being the east line of
Oak Street from Hampden Street to point three hundred and
seventy feet south or to land now or formerly owned
by A. A. Jones, the north line of this land for distance of
one hundred and eighteen feet or to the center of the
alley between Oak and Bh Streets and Hampden and
Dwight Streets, thence northerly along this alley to Hampden
Street. The plot contains about forty-three thousand, six
hundred and sixty square feet.

Fourth Plot: This land is located between the west side
of Oak Street, south side of Hampden Street, the north line
of the property of Catherine Lucey and the alley running
from Hampden to Dwight Street west of Oak Street and
contains forty-five thousand, five hundred and forty-eight
( square feet.

A sand bank was purchased from the Norris Estate for
three thousand, one hundred and fifty dollars ($ ),
the material from which will be used in the Outdoor Department, the purchase being considered necessary and advisable
owing to the extreme uncertainty of the amount of sand that
this city can yet purchase from the Holyoke Water Power
Company. As soon as this company puts into force its contemplated rule of selling no more sand the problem of obtaining this material for construction purposes will be a
serious one for all contractors as as well as the city to face.

The Jackson Street Underpass, started in  has been
completed and this street placed in good condition from
the Second Level Canal to Maple Street.

A new bridge has been constructed across the First
Level Canal on Sargeant Street at cost of nine thousand,
eight hundred and nine dollars ($ ).

That portion of the South Hadley Falls Bridge cared for
by the City has been thoroughly cleaned and repainted, a
large amount of flooring has been renewed at cost of one
thousand, one hundred and fifty-five dollars ($ ),
while the work of cleaning and painting the bridge cost

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.
two thousand, eight hundred and seventy-seven dollars and
seventy-seven cents ($ ), divided as follows: Amount
paid E. E. Emerson, contractor, one thousand, seven hundred
| and ninety-five dollars ($ ); for inspection, three
hundred and forth-three dollars ($ ); for paint, oil, etc.,
seven hundred and thirty-nine dollars and seventy-seven
cents ($ ). Work was delayed somewhat on account of
inattention on the part of the contractor but was finally
completed without loss to the City and without any detrimental effect to the bridge.

In the Highway Department it has been necessary to
spend considerable amount of money on all of the bridges
the current year. The Dwight Street foot-bridge has been
thoroughly repaired and strengthened at cost including
amount paid the contractor of one tiousand, seven hundred
and fourteen dollars ($ ). The Board is about to
repaint the bridge and paint has been bought at cost of
sixty-four dollars and sixty cents ($ ). The contract
for painting this bridge has been awarded and the work is
now progressing.

The Second Level Canal Bridge on Cabot Street will
very likely have to be replaced with new structure the
coming year and it is the opinion of the Board that all of the
canal bridges should be thoroughly repaired and repainted
the coming summer. This work may best be done during the
time that the water is out of the canals. The maintenance
cost of bridges is increasing yearly and as the present structures are replaced with modern bridges, permanent roadways
should be provided as the planking of the roadways of existing
structures Is large item of expense and is continually increasing as the trafhe over them grows. The wooden block
paving placed upon one span of the Willimansett Bridge
by the Chicopee authorities has proven very satisfactory and
it has been suygested that it would be the part of economy
for Holvoke to replace the plank roadway with this form of
wearing surface as the present planking wears out, taking
perhaps, one span each vear.

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.  

A start has been made the past year toward placing
some sort of permanent street signs upon the principal strects
and in all two hundred posts, with four signs to each
post, were erected. It ts believed that these signs will give
better satisfaction than any signs yet placed in the City
and it is the intention of the Board to add reasonable
number of signs yearly until all of the street intersections
have been properly cared for.

The work of applying coal tar and water gas tar for dust
laying purposes has passed the experimental stage in Holyoke
and considerable amount of work of this nature was done
during the year. All of the work performed has been generally
satisfactory, has preserved the surface of the roads and streets
and has saved considerable sum in the Street Watering
Department. The Board is indebted to the management
of the Gas and Electric Department for its co-operation,
that department having furnished, at the gas works, without
expense to the Board, all of the water gas tar used and a
considerable amount of coal tar.

The coming season the Board hopes to be able to purchase the necessary sprinkling apparatus for properly applving
these preparations, also to purchase sanitary street cleaning
apparatus for caring for the paved streets. The cost of the
latter machine is considerable, but there is much economy
in its operation. The machine its dustless in operation and
from investigations the Board believes it thoroughly cleans
the pavements.

The Board contemplates the continuation of permanent
street work, such as has been done during Iygcg, the coming
year and hopes to add largely to the amount of curbing laid.
During the current year some eleven thousand feet
of granite curbing was laid and experiments have been concluded in the construction of concrete curbing.  Approxtmately seven thousand square yards of new tar con- )
crete sidewalks have been laid. |

The cost of maintaining the Highway Department will
be increased over preceding years owing to the annexation

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.
of the Smith’s Ferry district, the roads in which location
must be improved as time passes.

In the City Property Department total of twelve |
thousand, six hundred and fifty-nine dollars ($ )
has been expended for the care and maintenance of school
buildings. Of this amount two thousand, four hundred and
ninety-five dollars ($ was spent in the Elmwood
School, the major portion being for repairing the damage
caused to the building by the fire which originated in the
exhaust chamber. Repairs in the High School building were
made, that amounted to one thousand, six hundred and fifty
dollars ($ ). The exteriors of the Highland, High and
Elmwood School buildings and the interiors of the Highland,
West Street and Elmwood School buildings were wholly or
in part refinished. The storm entrance at the Morgan School
building has been practically rebuilt. Some work has been
done in the maintenance of the plumbing fixtures while the
roof, which has in past years given trouble, has been repaired.

The repairs to the sanitaries of the South Chestnut
Street School building, begun in  were completed early
in the year. The Oakdale School building has been finished
and the grounds graded. walk has been constructed on
Sargeant Street and conerete curbing and gutter laid on
Sargeant Street and Chapman Avenue abutting the property.
When this section grows so that necessities demand, walk
must be provided on Chapman Avenue but this will not be
needed for some time.

A new sanitary has been constructed at the Park Street

School by the erection of brick addition to this building
and the installation of new plumbing therein. |

The cost of water used in school buildings amounted to
one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-nine dollars and
forty-three cents ($ ), while the water used in the
parks cost two hundred and one dollars and fourteen cents
(S ). The Park Commissioners, during the summer,
established wading pool at Riverside Park, which was used
by large number of children in that section of the city.

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.  
Water to the value of one “hundred and forty-two dollars
and eighty-two cents ($ ), was used in this pool, but
this charge was rebated by the Board of Water Commissioners,
for which acknowledgement is hereby made.

As this report is being prepared skating rinks are being
built in various sections of the City owing to the kindness
of the Water Department in furnishing the water necessary
to form the ice and through the courtesy of the Holyoke Water
Power Company in allowing land owned by this company
to be used for this purpose. The Board anticipates that these
will be enjoyed to great extent by children through the
entire city.

For School Janitor Service the City has expended more
than seventeen thousand, four hundred dollars ($ ),
while for supplies used by the school janitors, approximately
ive hundred dollars ($ was expended.

The lighting and power used in the school buildings
required an expenditure of more than three thousand dollars
($ and lighting of the engine houses approximately
seven hundred and fifty dollars ($ ). The sum of

| eleven thousand and sixteen dollars ($ has been
expended for fuel in school buildings.

A considerable amount of work has been done upon the
Highland, High Street, Mt. Tom Engine houses. The bathroom in the Elmwood Engine house has been practically
rebuilt.

The building on Elm Street secured from the Water
Department some years ago has been fitted as carpenter shop for the Building Department, the headroom in
the basement being increased and heating apparatus installed, which ts connected with the Elm Street School boilers.
The grounds in front of this building have also been improved
and have been used part of the year as playgrounds for the
young people in the immediate vicinity.

In the City Hall building new office has been fitted for
the City Auditor while the office formerly occupied by him

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.
has been given over to the use of the Gas and Electric Department.

A Forestry Department ‘has been established under an
ordinance passed by the Board of Aldermen, with Forester
working under the direction of the Board. The total cost of
this department amounted to one thousand, three hundred
dollars ($ in round numbers.

Six thousand, four hundred and seventy-eight )
feet of sewers have been constructed during the year of which
two thousand, four hundred and seventy-four feet
were storm water and four thousand and four feet
house sewers. That section of Oakdale lying west of Bh?
Street and south of Sargeant Street has been provided with
an adequate storm water system that will care for the drainage
of this section for some years. This work cost twelve thousand
four hundred and sixty-six dollars ($ ). At the present
time work is in progress upon new sewer in Canal Street
northerly from Appleton Street to accommodate the new
buildings to be erected by the Deane Steam Pump Division
of the International Steam Pump Company and it  anticipated that many such scwers must be provided during the
coming year.

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.
SEWERS. .

The length of sewers laid during the year was feet
of which the length of feet was laid for storm water
purposes in| Magnolia Avenue, Sargeant, Sycamore and
Franklin Streets to the Dingle east of Bh Street. This
sewer should be extended about feet further the coming
season in order that it can discharge directly into the main
stream flowing through the dingle.

The Maple Street culvert has been extended easterly
  feet thus making total length of this culvert of  
feet of which the length of fect  built west of the center
line of Maple Street.

For the location, size, alignment, cost and other details
of the sewers laid during the year see table I.

The total length of the sewerage system of this city
up to date is miles and the total cost It
extends practically in front of every residence and building
within the city and suburban limits.

So far as we know, it is one of the most or perhaps the
most complete sewerage system in any town or city, not only
in this country, but throughout the world having population of or more. There is no excuse today for vaults
or cesspools in the city and should any be still in use where
the sewer is within easy reach of the premises on which they
are located, the owners of such should be compelled to make
connections with the public sewer at once.

HIGHWAYS.

Under this heading miles or square yards
of tar macadam, square yards of wood block and  
square yards of granite block pavement have been constructed.
The blocks for the granite pavement were those taken from
Main Street to make place for the more modern and less
noisy wood block pavement.

Besides the construction of these pavements, considerable

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.  
work has been done in the way of re-surfacing with tar
macadam finish some of our older macadam and gravel
streets. This has not only been remarkable for the excellent
results obtained in allaying the ever annoying dust, but also,
as experience shows, for prolonging the life of these streets.

The high state of perfection to which our tar macadam
streets has been gradually developed is most gratifying
and for this great credit is due to the management and, especially to the Superintendent of out door work.

In the construction of these streets it is not perhaps
generally known by the citizens that the bituminious material used is one of the products of our municipal gas plant.
The cost of this material to the highway department is so
little that to this can be largely attributed the great impetus
given to street construction during the past few years.

Hence the municipal lighting plant has not only given
us cheaper gas and electricity but also, in an indirect way,
has been the cause of great development in our street
system, especially in the residential districts.

There are at present miles of permanently improved
streets out of the miles accepted by the City.

For the details and cost of the streets constructed and
resurfaced during the year see table II, and for those that
have been accepted by the city during the year see table HI.

BRIDGES.

Considerable work has been done in the bridge department. The eight spans of the county bridge under the care
of the city have been painted; new bottom cords have been |
added to the Dwight Street foot bridge; new structure
has been erected over the first level canal on Sargeant Street
to replace the wooden structure erected by the Water Power
Company in  and the Ingleside underpass is at present
being improved by the widening of the roadway which necessitates two new abutments and new superstructure. The

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.
work is being done by the N. Y. N. H. H. R.R. Co.,
one-third the cost of which will be charged to the City.

The new structure over the first level canal on Sargeant
Street is of the deck type and the full width of the street
with roadway of feet and two sidewalks of feet each.

On account of the length of the span and the little head
room between the surface of the water in the canal and the
grade of the street, deck bridge would have been out of
the question, were it not that the Holyoke Water Power
Company kindly consented to the construction of pier,
consisting of five inch cast iron columns set in the middle
of the canal. .

This divided the span into two spans of feet each and
made it both possible and economic to construct deck
bridge of great stability of steel beams and concrete reenforced with twisted steel bars.

The bridge was designed in this department, the plans
of which are shown on plates and and the work done by
contract, except the foundation for the columns dnd vitrified
brick pavement, which were done by the City.

The contractor, Mr. M. Fitzgerald, of Hoosick Falls,
N. ., who was also the contractor for the repairs on the
Dwight Street foot bridge, gave his personal attention to the
work which was performed faithfully and well.

The total cost of the bridge, including foundation for
columns, vitrified brick pavement and the relaying of the
granite block pavement approaches and sidewalks was
$ .

While the Dwight Street foot bridge has been materially
strengthened by the repairs made thereon, yet this structure,
owing to the corrosive effect upon it of the gases from the
locomotives, Is so rapidly deteriorating that it  only question of short time when it will have to be replaced by a
new structure.

Another bridge which should be replaced in the near
future by new structure is that on Cabot Street over the
second level canal. This bridge has not only reached its

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.  
’ limit of safety but on account of its narrow roadway the
passing of the street cars over it makes it dangerous for travel.
The total cost of the Jackson Street underpass, which
was finished last year and referred to in the annual report
of your Engineer, including all excavation, draining, paving,
curbing and sidewalks between Commercial Street and the
second level canal was .
Following is tabulated list of the bridges under the
care of the City together with their widths of roadway, sidewalks and areas of the same.

 For the location and other details of the curbing and

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.

Practically all our sidewalks are built of brick and tar
concrete. Within the last few years, however, Portland
cement concrete sidewalk is becoming rather popular even
in our residential, as well as in our business streets.

The greater cost of these sidewalks is offset by their
neat appearance as well as their much greater durability.

At the present time this department is compiling a
table which will show as far as possible the total length and
construction account of all the curbing and sidewalks laid
in the City to date.

STREET LINES DEFINED.

Granite stone monuments have been set defining the
new boundary lines of Northampton Street which was widened
in  between Morgan Street and the Northampton line.
A map has also been made showing these boundary lines and
given to the city solicitor to be recorded in the registery of
deeds.

PUBLIC BUILDINGS. »

An addition was added to the sanitaries of the Park
Street school from which the old plumbing was removed and
new plumbing of modern type installed therein. The new
plumbing consists of one twelve stall urinal battery an six
closets in the boys and eight closets in the girl’s sanitary.
Terazza floors have also been laid in both sanitaries.

All the work, both the addition and the plumbing, was
done by contract, the plans and specifications for which

INSPECTION OF BUILDINGS.

Your Engineer feels grateful for the passing of an ordinance relieving him of the duties pertaining to the inspection
of buildings and elevators and the placing of this work together with the inspection of wires in department by itself

as recommended by your Engineer in his annual report of
last year.
PARKS.

The arrangement made in the early part of the summer
between the Board of Park Commissioners and the City
Engineer by which the whole time of an assistant engineer
could be given to the work of the Park Department has
shown excellent results.

Through this arrangement the work as it progressed
was not only promptly attended to but number of surveys
and maps have been made for the use of the Board and the
Consulting Landscape Architect.

These include surveys and maps of all the parks showing
roadways, walks, water and drainage pipes, etc.; surveys
and cross-sections of the Elmwood Park between Elm and
Bh and High and Maple Streets; also of the Herbert
and Laliberte tracts which have been purchased for park
purposes.

In the latter tracts stone monuments have been set to
define the boundary lines of these tracts.

WATER DEPARTMENT.

The dry season of which caused so many water
famines all over this section of the country has been followed
by the still drier season of  .

This is seen by the records of the Fomer water shed which
show that the yicld of the driest month of is per

A  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.

cent. less than the yield of the driest month in and the
yield of the five driest consecutive months in  is per
cent. less than the yield of the five driest consecutive months
in  .

Notwithstanding this prolonged drought there has been
no shortage or even scarcity in the water supply, and the
possibility of water famine has been so remote that the
placing of restrictions on the legitimate use of water was
not even considered.

At the present time there is on hand an available storage to supply the City for days as well as an unavailable storage in Ashley that would supply the City for  
days additional, or days in all. The latter can be
easily made available as was done in  should conditions warrant It.

While this adequacy of the supply in these dry years
is highly satisfactory, nevertheless, it might be well to draw
attention to the discussion of this matter given in my annual
report of last year, and also in my report made to the Water
Commissioners in on the proposed Fomer supply extension, in which the following paragraph appears:

‘Again since inch main without storage will deliver
on the average from the new source in the driest years  
gallons daily into Ashley pond, an additional quantity to
meet the demands of Holyoke for the next fourteen years,
no storage will be needed at Fomer until the end of that time,
that is, in  when it is estimated the population of Holyoke
will be  .”

The high service resorvoir, which was unfit for use in
the summer of  owing to the bad tastes and odors in the
water, was drawn off in the fall and refilled in the spring in
order to see what effect this, together with the frost would
have upon the Nitella growths in the reservoir to which was
attributed the bad quality of the water.

A brick well with stop-plank opening was also constructed around the mouth of the intake pipe for the purpose

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.  
of enabling the supply to be drawn from or near the surface
of the reservoir as no odor and tastes had been detected in the
water at or near the surface.
The emptying and refilling of the reservoir, while it did
not kill the Nitella, considerably retarded its growth and the
water was of excellent quality throughout the summer
months.
Toward the end of September, however, Uroglena was
discovered in the reservoir and became epidemical in the
second week of October causing the water to become so foul
from the taps that the reservoir had to be turned off and
water from the Whiting Street reservoir substituted.
Since then the epidemic has continued and the odor and
taste of the water have been very pronounced. The average
number of colonies of Uroglena has been about with a
maximum of per cubic centimeter. ,
Our experience with the high service points out emphattcally that the thorough cleaning of reservoir basin, no
matter how excellent the results may be otherwise, Is at all
events, no guarantee against the growths of troublesome
organisms in reservoirs.*
GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT.
In the Gas and Electric Department specifications were
prepared for reinforced concrete flooring in the pipe-shop,
meter and lime rooms; measurements and plans were made
relative to the best location for the new purifiers, the foundations for which were laid out on the ground and locations
were given and assigned for the laying of new gas mains.
