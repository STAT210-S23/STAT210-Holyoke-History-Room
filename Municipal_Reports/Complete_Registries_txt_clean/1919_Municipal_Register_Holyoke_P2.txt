PART II. :

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF

| TRUSTEES
: To His Honor, the Mayor, and the Citizens of Holyoke:

The Board of Trustees for Vocational Education respectfully submits the following, the sixth annual report,
covering the year  .

A few subjects of interest to the general public are discussed, the details, statistics, and matters directly part of
the school being left to the Executive Officer and the Director for discussion.

SCHOOL MEMBERSIIIP

The extent to which Holvoke is real supporter of her
Voeational School may be measured by the membership of
the school. study of the plates and reports in this volume will prove that the situation is satisfactory, all conditions considered. It should be remembered that large enrolments count for nothing, if those who are enrolled do
not continue as members. real feature of this particular
situation at the Holyoke Vocational School during the past
two years, is the steady membership and attendance of
students who really seek the advantages which the school
has to offer.

SCHOOL FACULTY

The Board feels, that at the present time, the Holyoke

Voeational School has an exceptionally capable faculty. It

REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL  
may really be termed team. The spirit of harmony and
co-operation which prevails has been the best contributing
factor to the very successful year just completed. The city
should support the Board of Trustees in keeping this faculty
together. ,

NEW BUILDING
In previous reports it has been urged that the entire
school be housed in new building of its own. The following letter received from Mr. Robert O. Small, Director of
Voeational Edueation in Massachusetts, places real issue
before the citizens of the city:
‘“Mr. francis McSherry, Executive Officer Holyoke
Voeational School, Holyoke, Mass.

My Drar Mr. McSuHerry: In view of the inereased demands which the establishment of compulsory continuation schools will make upon your
vocational school quarters, the present unsatisfactory situation of your machine practice department,
and the prospects of larger development of other
departments, we are calling attention of the Board
of Trustees to that part of our agreement at the
time of establishment which dealt with proper locations and housing of the school.

You will recall that this matter was set forth
as follows:

 AN ASSURANCE

In view of the fact that the proposed scheme,

| as stated on the opening page of this communication, is temporary scheme to enable Holyoke to
begin state-aided industrial education at an early

- date and can be approved only upon these grounds,
we should have official assurance that the Board of
Trustees so understands it and pledges its efforts

  REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL

to bring about the housing of the independent industrial school in suitable building at the earliest
possible date. If this assurance of the Trustees is
supported by an expression of intention on the part
of citizens of Holyoke (official and private) to assist at the proper time in providing adequate quarters for the school, the Board of Education would
consider the scheme less in the light of an experiment and more as beginning of what promises to
be strong industrial school.’

We note the hearty way in which the trustees
supported by representative citizens gave assurance
upon this point.

It would seem that the time was opportune
for urging the City of Holyoke to provide the necessary and appropriate building contemplated
above. The vocational school has warranted the
confidence its promoters voiced. Only slight extension of its usefulness can be undertaken at its
present quarters, quarters which were frankly prescribed and approved as temporary ones.

May we hear from you regarding this matter
at your ccuvenience ?

Yours respectfully,
December RosBert O. SMALL.”’
The best argument for new building is stated in Mr.
Small’s letter. plain, substantial building of mill construction, put up on the unit plan and centrally located,  S
needed at once.
FEDERAL AID.
As the value of vocational education becomes more appreciated, the State and Federal Governments lend their educational and financial aid to the various cities and towns.

REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL  
Holyoke continues to be alert to this fact, and is receiving
its full share of the allotted funds, both from the Country
and from the State.
NEW DEVELOPMENTS

Legislation recently passed has brought to the Holyoke
Vocational School splendid opportunity for service, in the
interests of disabled soldiers and in behalf of employed
minors. In co-operation with the Federal Board of Vocational Edueation, and the Massachusetts Division of Vocational Education, and with the very real help of the Holyoke
Post of the American Legion, rehabilitation school for dis| abled former service men is about to be established in what
is known as the East Dwight Street School. Plans have been
prepared the building is being made ready; the first teacher
has been appointed; and the necessary equipment is arriving for this most worthy project.

The Massachusetts Legislature in passed law requiring the establishment and maintenance of continuation
schools and courses of instruction for employed minors between and years of age in cities and towns where there
are employed or more of such minors, and where, by
referendum vote, these cities and towns approve of such a
law. The Holyoke School Board delegated to the Board of
Trustees the administration of this law locally, and the organization and operation of the continuation school. This
work will be one of the principal projects of the Board of
Trustees for  |

CONCLUSION.

The Holyoke Vocational School is now an organization
of three divisions as follows: :

The Day and Evening School Division.

The Rehabilitation School Division.

The Continuation School Division.

  .

  REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL
The Board of Trustees of passes on to the Board
for the first of these three divisions, thoroughly organized and very successful. The organization of the other
two divisions and the joining of all three into composite
whole is work of service upon which the incoming Board
| of Trustees may look with real pleasure.
Respectfully submitted,
: JOHN J. O’CONNOR,
MRS. CHARLES A. CHASE,
JOSEPH B. WEIS,
Committee on Annual Report.

COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS

The three plates immediately following this section of
the report tell with sufficient clarity the story of the school’s
enrolment, membership and average attendance for the different years of its history. Holyoke does not demand the
biggest school in the state, but it does want to have good
one. comparison of the lines for the various years will
lead to the belief that the institution has never been on a
more healthy basis than at present. The co-operation of the
business interests of the city, the teamwork of the faculty,
and the spirit of the student body are all contributing
factors to this condition.

The suggestions contained in last year’s report as to
finding new and permanent quarters for the school should
be again made with, if possible, greater stress. Most of the
activities of the Vocational School should be housed under
one roof. Special classes may at times be handled to
greater advantage outside, but in the main the work should
be centralized. |

  REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL
COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS
In the Trade Extension work of this year there is a
noticeable dropping off in the enrolment. The average
school attendance, however, is holding up surprisingly well.
On the whole this is as it should be. An enormous enrolment with small average attendance can only mean one
of two things, either that number of people are being admitted to the school who have no business there, or that after being so admitted, the school is not giving them what they
came to receive. When the enrolment and attendance show
reasonable relations the presumption is immediately raised
that the school is doing an efficient job. |
Conditions in the labor market today are such that the
untrained man is commanding his own price, with the result that it is the very exceptional young man who real.
izes the necessity of self-improvement.

COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS
A departure from established precedent was made this
year in starting classes in Dressmaking and Millinery in the
afternoon. These classes have proved so popular that it
might be well next year to make serious attempt to carry
at least half the Practical Arts work in the afternoon in} stead of in the evening. The groups represented are of
very different elements, the afternoon classes being made up
largely of women from the homes, and the evening classes
almost entirely of women employed during the day. We
ean best serve the interests of these two very distinct groups
by giving individual treatment to each.

CONCLUSION
There is no need of going into the arguments for new
tuilding. We all know them by heart, but at this time, with
our immediate section of the country on the edge of period

REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL  
of expansion in mechanical and construction lines, we
will be almost criminally negligent if we fail to provide for
the educational demands which are so self-evident. When
such building is being considered it should not be planned
solely for boys’ school. Provision should be made to take
care of that part of our girl population who want and should
have an education in household and practical arts. This
would necessitate putting into your plans model flat, or
constructing outside practice house.

The handling of evening Vocational and Practical Arts
classes as customary throughout the country today is open
to question, particularly as to the wisdom of setting simultaneous dates for the opening and closing of all lines of inStruction. The time to open class in any given line is
When there is group of people ready to receive the inStruction therein to be given, and our evening work should
run the full ten months in the year with classes opening
Whenever the interest of group warranted such action,
and closing when the need was satisfied.

A suggestion for co-operation between the school authorities and the employers of the city might not be amiss at
this point. This school has had most gratifying success in
training young men who came here for short time after a
Period of years spent in the trade. The progress made by
these men has been almost unbelievable, and leads naturally
to the thought that employers with bright young men in
their shops could well afford to join the school authorities
in establishing short scholarships so that opportunity would

be given to some of these men (who really cannot afford to
entirely quit work), to maintain themselves, at least in
Part, on the prods of their scholarships, while perfecting
themselves in their craft.

The school has received so many courtesies and kindnesses from officials and citizens that we could not begin to
thank them all. Occasionally something happens, however,
that demands special recognition. Holyoke has received in

ae

| the last few months from Mr. Frederick J. Trinder, State |
, Director of Vocational Education for Connecticut, two evidences of friendly interest that should receive special mention. Several weeks ago Mr. Trinder sent to Holyoke and
| allowed to be exhibited at the Suffolk Theatre film ‘‘Opot portunity’’ prepared by the Connecticut State Board for
| Vocational Education for the purpose of familiarizing the
| people of the state with the work of the Vocational Schools.
| Since then Mr. Trinder has extended the courtesy of his

Gentlemen: present herewith the annual statement of
the receipts and expenditures for the fiscal vear  in the
form and manner required by the State of Massachusetts.

as each must be separately checked it takes months to complete the audit of his accounts.

The report also contains detailed report. of the expenditures in the Contingent Account, City Indebtedness, Tax Colleetor’s Exhibit, Bonds issued during the year with the pur- 
pose for which they were issued, the eash on hand, borrowing

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD
 |
The report of the Superintendent which is annexed to
and made part of this report, shows in detail the work |
done by the department during the year, the various expenditures for extensions, repairs, etc., and the usual statistical data to which we respectfully refer you for information
in matters which may be of interest to you. Only such ex- i
tensions were made as were required to meet the demands
for new real estate developments. No replacement of mains
were made and although there may be few places in the !
distribution system where pipes of larger size would be prefered, nevertheless the Board does not feel that the benefits
obtained by replacing them would warrant the large expense
that would be entailed at present prices, except in the case
of the buildings at Mt. Marie where, in the opinion of the
Chief of the Fire Department, there is neither the pressure
nor volume of water that would be needed for large fire.
An arrangement which will remedy this inadequate fire protection has been worked out by officials of both departments
and now waits for the formal approval of the Board of Fire
Commissioners.
A petition was received from the property owners on
Cherry Street, Homestead Avenue and Jarvis Avenue for
the extension of the water mains to that section of the city
the greater part of which territory is higher than the elevation of our highest reservoir. Any proposition to supply
water in that section would be quite expensive, requiring in
addition to new pipe lines stand-pipe or its equivalent and
the necessary pumping machinery. The Board after public
hearing and careful consideration of the expense involved
and the small revenue expected from water rents felt obliged
— to decline to grant their request. It is likely that the future
construction of apartment blocks on the Highlands and the
development of house-lots on the hills west of Northampton
Street may soon present problem for additional water supply and fire protection, the solution of which might possibly

|
REPORT OF WATER BOARD  
include the extension petitioned for. Under present conditions, however, it could not be considered.

The only new work done at the local reservoirs was at
the Whiting Street Reservoir where new shelter house for
the watchmen was constructed and new gate erected at the
arch across the road near Kenilworth. The work at the
White Resvervoir started late in the season of was continued this year; what remains to be done to complete the
work there will require comparatively small force during
the coming season.

For the sanitary protection of the waters of the Fomer
Water-Shed the Board purchased from the City Co-operative Bank for  farm in Southampton located about
one mile above the Fomer Reservoir. This farm contains
about sixty-five acres of land with buildings in poor condition and has for its boundaries the Manhan brook on the
east and the Tucker brook on the west. It is the opinion of
the Board that the surest and easiest way of preventing
possible pollution at the source of supply is to buy such
places as this when the opportunity arises to secure them at
a reasonable figure. The Department now owns per cent
of all the land draining into the Fomer Reservoir. The
Board also purchased from Mrs. Venerance Martin acre
tract of land located on the northerly side of the highway at
the High Service Reservoir. Including this tract the Department now owns per cent of the drainage area of the
High Service Water-Shed.

Claims against the Department are made from time to
time by parties who feel they have suffered damage for which
this department is responsible. In the case of Eugene Griffin
for damage resulting from flooding his premises on account
of broken water-pipe, settlement was made by payment
of The claim of Thomas Steinmacher for damages
resulting from taking in about two acres of his land
on the westerly side of the Whiting Street Reservoir is still

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD

unsettled as Mr. Steinmacher refuses to accept what the

Board considers fair sum for the land taken.

Notification was received from Mrs. Clementine Briggs

. Doran that the Smiths Ferry water main is located for two

hundred or three hundred feet on land owned by her and

that she is entitled to substantial sum on account of the

damage she thereby incurs; this matter is still pending.

Upon request of parties interested the Board gave con: sideration to the rule passed in whereby  per front
foot is charged to all abutters on streets in which extensions
of new mains are made.

Investigation showed that in almost all cases of extensions even though the abutters paid the assessment as levied,
more than one-half the total cost of the new extension was
borne by the Water Department, that in the majority of the
cases when the tracts would be fully developed and paying
water rents at present rates the extensions would not earn
enough revenue to meet the interest on the money invested
and the taxes this department would have to pay for the extension. The Board voted to continue this rule and also
voted that charge graduated to the size of the connection
be imposed on all new services.

Public dissatisfaction with the ice dealers on account of
prices charged and alleged short comings in methods of retailing led to protest being filed with the Board and request was made that permission to harvest ice from the City
Reservoirs for the season of be withheld by the Water
Commissioners unless these conditions were remedied. This
Boxrd has no power to regulate the price that the dealers may
ask for their ice, neither has it any power to interfere with
them in their manner of doing business in the same sense as

. state commissions regulate the gas and electric departments, trolley systems, or other public or semi publie service
eorporations. We ean grant them permission to harvest
their crops from our reservoir and see that they carefully

—
ro \
REPORT OF WATER BOARD |
observe our rules for the sanitary protection of the water, |
or we can refuse them permission if in our judgment that is  
the best thing to do. Since, however, large part of the ice
required is harvested from other sources than our reservoirs, /
namely, Street’s Pond, Connecticut River, South Hadley :
Falls and Willimansett, if we refuse them permission to 
harvest from our reservoirs we help create shortage which
will furnish an excuse for higher prices and less satisfactory
conditions than we have at present. The largest dealer, ,
however, in conference with the Board states that prices in
Holyoke were lower than in surrounding places and promised
that the price of ice in will be reasonable, depending :
mainly on cost of labor and whether or not the season is BO
favorable one for ice harvesting.

Report of the Superintendent.
To THE HoNnoRABLE BoaRD OF WATER COMMISSIONERS:

Gentlemen: have the honor to submit to you the re
port of your Superintendent for the year  |

The rainfall for the year was the greatest since |
and the level of the water in the reservoirs was well main' tained during the year. The total quantity of water i
storage in our reservoirs on November  th was million
gallons compared with million gallons on the same date
in and million gallons on the same date in  .

The consumption of water for the year was at the rate
of gallons per day per capita which is gallons less than
the rate per capita for the year  The total quantity
of metered water used during the year is about million
gallons less than the quantity used in due mainly to
a curtailment of business in the mills at the beginning of
the year.

Real estate developments resumed after the war required :
the extension of many new water mains the locations, sizes,
lengths and eost of which are shown in the table annexed to
this report. The cost of doing this work as well as all other
work done is higher than in the past due to the increased
eost of materials and to the advance in wages given to our
employees to enable them to mect the high cost of living. .

New services were installed at an average cost of .
Services were renewed at an average cost of ;

New hydrants were installed at the request of the Board :
of Fire Commissioners at locations recommended by them. :

of
REPORT OF WATER BOARD  
No replacements of mains was done during the year and |
it is my opinion that none will be required during the coming year. Lo |
The arrangement by which the Highlands portion of the |
High Service District is supplied by the Whiting Street
Reservoir during the summer months was continued this :
year with satisfactory results. 
The major part of work done at the reservoirs this year ,
was performed at the White Reservoir where the relocation
of the highway and the construction of the earth embankment on the down stream side of the dam which was begun
last year was continued with force of about twenty-five
men, most of whom were returned service men. They were }
carried to and from their work each day in the two Federal ot
Trucks owned by the Department one of which was bought
this year mainly for that purpose. The uncompleted part
of the work will not require many men as the earth work
can be handled better with wheel scrapers.
A new shelter house for the watchmen was constructed
at Whiting Street Reservoir replacing the one burned two .
years ago. The offices in the building at Commercial Street
were painted and new boiler for heating purposes was installed in place of the old one condemned by the State Inspector of Boilers.
The thinning out of the chestnut trees and other growth
on the water shed of our local reservoirs and the lumbering
operations at Fomer provided the department with couple
of hundred cords of fire wood which were sold at retail mainly
to our own employees.
Only small part of the opportunity which this department has to reforestate its water sheds was taken advantage of last season when white pine trees were set
out on the Whiting Street water shed. recommend that
this year at least trees be set out, some on our local
water sheds and the balance on the unproductive land owned
by the department adjacent to the White Reservoir.

REPORT OF THE  
| Health Officer.
To THE BoarpD oF HEALTH OF THE CITY OF HOLYOKE, Mass.
Gentlemen: Following are the reports of the employees
of the Health Department:
{
GENERAL HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITION OF
THE CITY |
The marked diminution in the number of cases of con- ;
tagious diseases and deaths therefrom reported during the
year  and the absence of threatened epidemic of any
character is very gratifying to the department, affording as it
does very good indication of the health of the people and
the sanitary condition of the eity.
Notwithstanding these very satisfactory conditions this
Board would urge your consideration of recommendation
made to former City Council so that as soon as the financial
condition of the city will warrant, some definite action may be
taken thereon.
. An arrangement of some character to be made that would
provide for the elimination of neighborhood dumps and permit of cleaning up of the unsanitary conditions surrounding
them.
SANITARY INSPECTIONS
The report of the Sanitary Inspectors offers concrete evidence of the work of this branch of the health service. Many

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH —
new duties have been assigned to the force, and the scope of .
, their work has been extended as far as the force and funds
available will permit. ,
MILK AND FOOD INSPECTIONS
Milk and food inspections during the year have shown
good results. Many stores, bakeries and ice cream parlors
were inspected and required to make improvements. The
amount of food stuffs condemned and destroyed was sufficient
‘to convince dealers, ‘‘so inelined,’’ that foods unfit for human
consumption eannot be sold or offered for sale in this city.
The departinent is making an earnest effort to comply
with the requirements of Chapter of the Acts of  ,
which provides for the inspection of all out-of-town dairies
whose owners desire to sell milk in the city of Holyoke.
TUBERCULOSIS HOSPITAL
During the year the Sanatorium provided days’
board for patients, this being daily average of persons.
Of these number were out-of-town patients, for whose care
the city is reimbursed by the State or the city or town from
which the patient comes.
The actual receipts therefrom during amounted to
$ .
 CONTAGIOUS HOSPITAL
This institution continues doing its excellent work. With
additions it should be adequate for the city’s wants for a
number of years tocome. With the coming summer the gradings of the grounds should be completed, that thorough and
adequate drainage may be provided this year. Appropriations should be sufficient to permit the same to be completed.

  REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH

REPORT OF THE
Sani I
itary inspector. ,
“Dee, .
To THE BoarD OF HEALTH:
Gentlemen: hereby submit for your consideration some
of the work that have done in the past year.
INSPECTION OF TENEMENTS
During the months of December, January, February and
March, excepting to care for complaints that came to me for
inspection, all my time was taken up. inspecting tenements,
and have on file in the office of the Board of Health special
inspection eards filed by wards and streets. can now inform
your Board that during the past five years, during the winter
months, this work has been done by me, that recorded survey of all the tenement property in the city excepting Elmwood, Oakdale and the Ilighlands has been completed.
INSPECTING AND ABATING NUISANCES
During the year have inspected two hundred and sixty
( complaints and several of them found to constitute
dangerous nuisances, others were of the kind that make life
and habitation unpleasant. The complaints that were a
menace to health were immediately abated, regardless of cost,
the others were cared for by more deliberate process,
INSPECTION OF ALLEYS AND YARDS
] The Board of Health especially assigned to me the task
of trying to improve the appearance of the alleys, yards and

  REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH
vacant lots of the rubbish and papers that too often is thrown
into and scattered around them and from the alleys and yards
eventually reaching our streets and sidewalks, which causes
them to appear neglected and dirty. In trying to improve
permanently these conditions have ordered the removal of
all ash boxes from the alleys. Also ordered owners of buildings to put and keep their ash chutes in such condition, that
the refuse that is put in said chutes by tenants will remain
intact until removed by the proper collectors. This can only
be done by keeping all ash chute doors locked.
INSPECTING GARBAGE RECEPTACLES AND GARBAGE COLLECTORS
This work has also been assigned to me by the Board of
Health and notwithstanding that through some arrangement
existing for years this work is supervised and contracted for
by the Board of Public Works, it is absolutely Board of
Health work and through me the Board constantly tries to
eare for the health of the thousands of men, women and children who live in our thousands of tenement blocks in this city
and who are constantly exposed to the many and dangerous
nuisances that must be watched and abated. have cared
for many such cases during the last year.
The Board of Health requested all the garbage contractors to file with them hst of the names of all men working for them, and only two of the contractors that have lved contracts from the Board of Public Works to collect
garbage have complied with the requests of the Board of
| Health by sending in the names of the employees and subeontractors. The facts are, that under existing conditions
when the scores of complaints that come to the Board of
ITealth office about uncollected garbage and are referred to
me, mspect conditions and must then refer them to the
Board of Public Works, causing delay that at times is dangerREPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH  
ous to many persons, instead of settling direct and effectively
with each case as soon as reported.

CO-OPERATION NEEDED, TO BE EFFECTIVE

Through experience positively state that more effective
and permanent results would be attained if the efforts of the
Board of Health were more thoroughly assisted by the Police
Department in enforeing the City Ordinances and our city
streets and alleys would not only appear better but the citizens would appreciate the needed improvements.

In conclusion desire to thank the members of the department for their courtesy and co-operation.

; Respectfully submitted,
 (Signed) DANIEL D. MAHONEY, |
Sanitary Inspector.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Permit me at this time, to extend thanks to those friends
of the Institutions, who have throughout the year by their
kind acts and remembrances (in the form of clothing, flowers
and reading matter) brought happiness and encouragement
to the patients.

Sincere thanks are also due the members of the Board of
Health, and Board of Public Works and all office attaches,
for their courtesies and willing cooperation. |

I deeply appreciate the services of the medical and nursing staff, which has been so well and cheerfully rendered,
and the faithful work of all the employees.

Respectfully submitted,
(Signed) MARGARET G. HEALEY, R. N.,

REPORT OF THE.
’
Child Welfare Department.

The Child Welfare Department of the City of Holyoke
presents its first annual report. On May the Board of Aldermen passed an
ordinance creating new department having special concern for the health and the welfare of children, particularly
those under school age. Section of this ordinance reads:
This ordinance shall take effect as of December .

After the naming of the commission by the Mayor and
confirmation by the Board of Aldermen, the commission organized and elected chairman and secretary.

The first business of the commission was to vote to assume the responsibility and management of the municipal
milk station which had since June been in the hands
of the Holyoke Infant Hygiene Association,

The passage of the state law, known as the anti-aid
amendment, made it illegal for this organization to continue
the administration of the affairs of the milk station and receive financial support from the city. Believing it to be
a civic responsibility having an economic as well as humanitarian value out of all proportion to the expense involved, the
nine years’ work of the Infant Hygiene Association was recognized as public necessity which no administration could
afford to ignore.

Holyoke’s progressiveness was again demcnstrated by
the action taken by the Mavor and the Board of Aldermen
in May,  .

REPORT OF THE CHILD WELFARE DEPARTMENT  
' OUTLINE OF ACTIVITIES

InFaAnT CarE—Furnishing modified and whole milk of
high grade with special formulas for sick and malnutrition
eases. Visits to the homes by the trained nurse for supervision of the care of babies and the teaching of mothers. Weekly
clinics where babies are weighed and examined, and mothers
advised or encouraged.

PRENATAL CareE—Instruction to expectant mothers in
personal hygiene, nourishment, preparation for event, teaching American customs to the foreign mothers in the care of
their homes and children. .

PRE-SCHOOL AND Nutrition Cuiinics—Weighing and examination of children under school age, advice to mothers
and visiting nurses; finding proper care for needy or neglected cases of sub-normal children.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT

The department has expended  for salaries and
$  for maintenance. This last covers milk, ;
sugar of milk, cane sugar, bottles, corks, pails, ;
ice, rent, cleaning, gas and electricity,  coal and wood, cartage, express,  ;
earfare for visiting nurse, incidental laboratory expense, .

Receipts from the sale of milk, .

NEEDS FOR PURPOSES OF EXTENSION

This is department which from its nature in city
like Holyoke must expect to receive increasing financial support from the city. To fulfill its purpose it must reach,
teach and save an ever-increasing number of mothers and
babies.

Every child added to the list adds to the expense. For
more than two years the milk station has been inadequate,
performing double the amount of work which its space and
equipment was planned for. It has been justly critized
as unsanitary. However, the greatest caution in all that per  REPORT OF THE CHILD WELFARE DEPARTMENT

tains to the handling of the milk itself has made it possible
to keep it in the class with the high-priced, certified milk of
many other cities.

Now that the city has acknowledged the importance of
child welfare work it cannot afford to allow it to fall under
the condemnation of state sanitary inspectors or the criticism
of the increasing number of visitors who come to Holyoke
to study its methods.

A simple structure, roomy, light, with up-to-date equipment, is what is absolutely necessary before the work can
be furthered to any great extent.

The parental work, now reaching only such cases as
the visiting nurse can find time for, can not be properly
covered until full time prenatal nurse can be secured and
education along this line actively promoted.

More than mothers die each year in the United
States from child-bearing. causes. The unaccountable number of still births can not be reduced until prenatal care and
instruction becomes available to every mother.

A former representative has estimated the economic loss
of child’s life to the community at With the birth
rate approximately the same, the total number of deaths
under one year of age, for the year ending October ,
was  For the year ending November it was  
—a mortality rate of  .

The plans now maturing for opening the pre-school age
clinics will entail only nominal expense. The child who
enters school without clean, healthy body and mind is wasting the public money in large degree. Whatever the expense, within reason, it Should not be wanting when it comes
to carrying out these plans. In the children’s weighing and
measuring campaign, directed by the Federal Children’s
Bureau in  and carried out locally under the auspices
of the Infant Hygiene Association, over such children
were found in Holyoke. For obvious reasons this was probably much under the actual number.

REPORT OF THE CHILD WELFARE DEPARTMENT  
During the summer months much difficulty in obtaining
satisfactory conditions in the dairy of the local dealer necessitated change of dairies. The milk is now under the supervision of the dairy department of Massachusetts Agricultural
College. Inspection of the farm dairies, local dairy and
handling of the milk at the station, with analysis, will assure
patrons of high quality milk for thier babies.

HAMPDEN PARK
Only the general maintenance work has been done here.
The trees and shrubs are in poor condition the shrubs having
been run out and the trees are going so fast that few years
will see but few good ones remaining. This is very serious
eondition and one demanding immediate attention on account of the prominent location of the park and should be
remedied the coming year. The lawns would also need fertilizer and the retaining of man before and after the close of
the park would prevent much damage to the trees and
shrubs. .
PROSPECT PARK
A condition has arisen here which will require attention
very soon and that is the repairing of the base of the parapet wall. This condition is going from bad to worse and
may at any time become dangerous. Another matter which
has been brought up before is the repairing or replacing of
the walk bordering the park, this walk being not only detraction from the appearance of the park but also very dangerous to visitors there. The old shelter at the corner of
High Street will also call for repairs the coming year. The
usual maitenanee work was done during the year.
ELMWOOD PARK
This being one of the larger parks requires much attention to keep it up satisfactorily. The park has done well this
year. The culvert was extended early in the year and the
fill brought up so that temporary passage across the dingle
was made. The culvert should be connected on the east end
and the park developed and cleaned up as far as Pine street.
 

  REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS
RIVERSIDE PARK

For the proper enjoyment of the wading pool new
shelter house for the children was constructed this year with
a room for the matron. This was built by M. J. Walsh and
Sons for the sum of  and was greatly needed. The
rose garden while not as large as desired makes an attractive
addition to the park; the suggestion is made that donations
of beds from societies or individuals would be great help to

| the enlargement of this feature. The shrubs along Main street
could be thinned to great advantage and should be tended
to this year and also new curbing of permanent construc; tion built around the wading pool. This park on account of
its large area requires much extra help to keep it in good
condition.
CANONCHET PARK

New walks around the park and the improvement of the
terraces are required here to put the park in good condition.
New shrubs should also be planted and the lawns fertilized.
| HAMILTON AND GERMANIA PARKS

These parks had to be turned over and reseeded in the
spring. Some remedy should be tried to overcome this condition every spring as the results obtained hardly pay for
the expense entailed.

FAIRFIELD AVENUE AND SMALLER PARKS

These parks have been cared for and kept up in good
condition during the year; new shrubs could be added with
advantage to appearanee of the plots.
JONES PARK AND NORTHAMPTON STREET CORNERS

At this park nothing was done during the year; the
park having large area special appropriation would be
necessary to make any showing and start should be made
if possible the coming year.

REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS  

The plots at the corner of Northampton and Dwight
streets and the plot at the corner of Northampton and
Lincoln streets should be laid out and improved. These plots
are situated in very favorable location and the improvement and development here would create an excellent impression on the large number of travelers on this highway.

IN CONCLUSION ,

The Board would mention in addition to the many
recommendations contained herein the matter of labor on the
parks. The parks have been handicapped in this respect as
more than one third of our labor account is expended in the
watching or policing of the parks and for this reason more
help should be provided. The Board would recommend the
eirlier opening and later closing of the parks as much damage is done when no men are on the parks. 

For the proper maintenance of the parks for the coming year the Board will require the amount of 
and if any improvements are to be started an amount of at
lesst  should be appropriated. .
