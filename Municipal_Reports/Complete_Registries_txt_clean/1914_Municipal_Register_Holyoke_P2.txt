ANNUAL REPORT OF THE
Supervisor of the Holyoke Playgrounds
FOR  

—  To the Honorable Board of Playground Commissioners of
the City of Holyoke, Mass.

I have the honor to present to you my third report as
Supervisor of the Holyoke Playgrounds for the season  .

The past year has seen the playground system of this
city attain recognized position as leader in this section of
the country. The report of the Massachusetts Civie League
for comments upon the Holyoke Playgrounds as follows:

In this place ought to be mentioned an experience that
horrifies the conservative and rejoices the lovers of humanitv. refer to Holyoke’s Sunday baseball games, and the
fine quality of its playground supervision. It has no superior in the liberal pride of its citizens in their playground
activities. The city has so finely developed the playground
spirit, and its significance in the life of its vouth that it has
not only permitted but encouraged amateur baseball on Sunday on four of its pubhe playgrounds; two match games on
each ground Sunday afternoons during the season. The attendance at each ground is from one to three thousand; behavior of the crowds (I saw one of three thousand) at critical points in the game was superbly self-controlled. No
police on the ground. The fiction is maintained that the
police must not go on the grounds during game because it
would be their duty under the law to arrest the three thousand more or less participants, and Holyoke has not enough
police stations and jails to hold tenth of that number. The
orderliness ‘and decorum in these crowds was onlv provoked

  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS
to alternate cheers and groans. The knowledge of each indi- |
vidual was that any turbulence or rowdyism would end Sunday baseball in Holyoke. Picture the condition there: a
crowd of twenty-five hundred people, ten to fifteen nationalities, men and women from the shops and mills, each partisan of one of the nines, doubtful decisions by the umpire,
favorites being batted all over the field, victory, defeat,
no police, no disturbance, eight such situations each Sunday
demanded by law-abiding, self-controlled crowds and by
nine citizens out of ten, and especially by the mothers of boys
over fourteen. The query forces itself as to which is more
sacred—such period of wholesome life, or period of twen- ,
tv-four hours’ duration called ‘‘Sunday.’’

The Statutes of the Holyoke Playgrounds in the East is
owing in large measure to the broad, sane and progressive
spirit of your honorable Board in the conduct of all mothers connected with the Playground System of this city.

This year notable advances have been made. The purchasing of more land around the Morgan School property
provides more space for play for the children, and the area
ean be flooded and used for small skatmg rink during the
winter.

The second notable advance was the addition of the new
Prospect play field. This field is.a large one and its complete development will make it highly attractive and fully
equal to the needs of the locality for many years to come.
The development of this field is being worked out as far as
funds will permit. The past year large amount of filling
and grading was done, back stop built and beautiful
ball field completed. It is planned to lay out another baseball diamond at the northeast corner, also running track |
and football field. would recommend to the commissioners |
the purchase of this property as soon as possible.

Another notable advance was the establishing of super- !
vised play evenings on the West street and Hampden street
playgrounds. From the attendance which will be found on

another page it proves conclusively that this was move in
the right direction and should be continued and extended
more next season.

DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION
FOR GIRLS.

This department was broadened the past summer by the
addition of simple and suitable athletics. Girls in general,
up to the age at which they leave school, are much more diffieult to reach than are boys. The play imstinet is not as
active in girls, and what there is is smothered more or less
by the cares of home and smaller children which are forced
upon them. This results in prematurely shortening the period of girlhood with consequent loss of health, strength and
poise. What is needed and must be provided is longer play
period in order that the girl may have the opportunity for |
normal development of body and mind. To this end each
vear we seek to enmch the program so that our girls may
feel more keenly the attraction of the playgrounds.

' This last summer was planned course of field athleties
and group games that were intended to benefit the girls along
the lines in which they are in whole naturally weak. The
beneficial results from this course were threefold. First,
in creating the desire in the girls for better physical development; second, in arousing their social consciousness of
the rights of others, and third in making them feel in social sense the need and value of co-operation.

RAFFIA AND BASKETRY.

Basketry is one of the oldest handicrafts of man, but it
reached its greatest excellence with the tribes of American Indians who wove baskets from grasses, reeds, and rushes which
they gathered and colored. The material made by the Indians is not available for us, but imported raffia, rattan and
rushes form excellent substitutes. more instructive oceupation cannot be found for children. It is not only fasei  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS

nating in itself, but it develops patience, judgment, dexterity and skill and embodies the satisfaction of making a
beautiful and useful article. More children were enrolled
in the classes than during the pr ding vear with the corresponding increase of interest and greater amount of material was used.

. FOLK DANCING.

Folk Dancing is favorite and healthful exercise for
girls of all ages. Through the Folk Dances we have many opportunities to educate the social and moral side of the child
and direct the formation of right habits and high ideals of
conduct. The types of dancing most desired for exercise and
recreation are those that have historical value such as many
of the European and old American dances.

SEWING.

| Under the supervision of Mrs. M. EF. Kostenbader the
classes have made wonderful progress the past season. This
course in sewing for playground work has been found praetical and satisfactory concerning the essential points in the
process of sewing and correct material to use. The particular garments chosen in the course progress from the simpler
to the more complex processes of construction. They are
used every day, therefore, the necessity for making them
from an economle point of view, sewing should be necessitv in every playground for the older girls, especially to
teach her that all day eannot be spent in play, but that work
and play go hand in hand. These are the girls who will exert the great influence at home and in the community, having
learned the proper and correet dress and home decoration and
the greatest value derived from the least expenditure. The
playground sewing will return to the city hundredfold their
Investment.

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
. STORY TELLING.

Story telling on the playgrounds ranks with any other
occupation in the power of producing good results. It trains
a child to contemplate the ideal of life and conduct by developing his imagination. It makes him more svympathetie
to the thought and feelings of others, thus making him more
unselfish. It trains him to greater power of concentration
and attention, while the retelling of stomes by the ehild himself leads to the forming of clearer mental images, to the
grasping of moral truth and to the use of good English. A
child who has been trained to appreciate good hterature by
means of story telling will develop the power of judging right
from wrong, as well as to love the best in literature, one of
the greatest gifts human being can possess for his own
pleasure and profit. Story tellmg on the playgrounds has
been earried on by the directors and her assistants.  Arrangements were made at the Public Library for books to be
set aside for the use of the playground workers, and splendid lst of stories were selected.

PHYSICAL EDUCATION FOR BOYS.

The earnest and enthusiastic efforts of the men mstruetors with the bovs showed marked advaneement in getting the
boys interested in play and reereation. number of new

* aetivities for boys were introduced during the past season
and great interest was manifested in the Inter-Playground
Tournaments held about the middle of the season. The greatest Interest was shown in our great American game of baseball with twelve baseball teains, two teams on each playground. Two leagues were formed, the Junior and Senior
leagues. schedule of one hundred and twenty games were
plaved, Hampden street winning the pennant in the Junior
League, and the West street team carried off the honors in
the Senior League in very close race,

  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS
SLOYD WORK—REED BASKETRY.

This department was under the direction of Miss Helen
C. Moriarty, who visited each playground one day week.
The Slovd work was more popular than ever; more boys were
enrolled in the classes than during the preceding year, and
many new models were made. Reed basketry was extended |
on larger scale. The bovs showed passion for this kind
of construction play, so much so that we doubled the number

"in the classes on each playground.
CANE SEATING.

To cane seat chairs is not difficult art, yet it is practical and useful, and has decided value in teaching the handling of splints. This is form of creative play which brings
the home close to the playgrounds, and has the deeided approval of the parents, as it combines play and work in the
right proportion for the normal boy. Over one hundred and
fifty chairs were reseated on the six playgrounds. Marked
advancement was shown in this department.

ATTENDANCE.

This deem the most gratifying part of my report. The
attendance this vear was in excess of last season, and when
the number of rainy days during the months of July and
August are considered it speaks volumes as to the feeling of
the children in regards to the playgrounds. The attendance
was taken twice daily at two and four p. m., the total number being divided by two to find the attendance each day.

winter, under the supervision of the Park Commissioners havebeen greatly appreciated by many and perhaps call for mention in this report.

Our playgrounds have been used by various organizations and clubs on Saturdays and holidays for baseball, football, ete., permits for such use being given by the Supervision.

SPECIAL EVENTS.

The special events which occurred durmg the past season are all worthy of record. During the week of July to
 Mothers’ Day was held on each playground. series
of events were held, each playground having two meets, one
on the home grounds and one away. The interest displayed
not only by the children but by the parents, especially the
mothers, showed that they feel the playgrounds are of vital
importance in the line of their growing ehildren. The attendanee of adults at these events were large and much enthusiasm was shown by the children. Prizes were given the
winners, which consisted of pennant banner, bearing the inscription, ‘‘Mothers’ Day, Holyoke Playgrounds.’’

CLOSING EXERCISES.

The closing exercises were held Friday, August  A
new. plan was tried this vear; instead of bringing all the chil- —
dren together on the large Maple Street Playgrounds, a
special program of events was held on each playground,
where the local community interest was seen at its best.

The attendanee at each playground was large. The children were the host and hostesses and the relatives, but especially the mothers, the guests. The games and dances shown
were some of our every day program on our playgrounds.
The articles made by the children were placed on display at
the Thomas E. Childs’ store window on Wednesday and
Thursday, August and  and ived many expressions.
of appreciation from those who saw them.

RECOMMENDATIONS.

The Supervision has the following recommendations to
make for the new year:

The establishment of more school centers with more privileges in the use of the school building. School centers should
be established at the Elm Street, Park Street, Nonotuck
Street and Springdale schools.

MORNING AND EVENING SUPERVISION.

Provision should be made to have our playgrounds open
mornings and evenings during the playground season with

  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS

workers in attendance from a. m. to p. m. This can be

done with slight increase in the salaries. ,
HAMPDEN STREET PLAYGROUND.

The building of lattice shelter close to the wading pool
that the children may change their clothing. More electric
lights should be installed, and if possible the fencing of this
playground. If this could be accomplished it would make an
ideal playground. Handball courts could easily be installed
and would recommend the building of platform where
evening daneing could be conducted during the summer
evenings.

EQUIPMENT.

Giant strides should be placed on Hampden street, West

Street, Morgan School and Elmwood playgrounds.
LIGHTS.

More electric lights should be placed on all our playgrounds. This think would eliminate to great extent the
destruction of property done during the evenings.

MUSIC.

Musie is large factor in proper playground work.
Without it in some form the work is work indeed, not play.
Bevond anything else musie works for order, refinement, the
ennobling of emotions, and teaches the great lesson of the
need of concerted action, without which there can be no greatness national or religious life. Arrangements should be
made for the use of all school buildings (in which there are
pianos) adjoining the playgrounds for period each day, or
vietrolas should be purchased and placed on each playground.

Before closing this report the Supervisor would commend our staff of playground workers. They are inspired
by high motives and have earnestly striven to help the children through our playground activities to robust, physical

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
health and strength, and the formation of right habits of
eonduct. Our city will discover as years go by that in its
building material for bigger and better Holyoke the character of its citizenship will also be improved. This is part
of the results of the wisdom shown today by the Playground
Commission in providing as far as they can for the healthy,
spontaneous activities of childhood and youth upon the supervised playgrounds of this city. sure foundation for the
citizenship of the future Holyoke.

The Supervisor desires to thank your Honorable Board
for the many official courtesies which have been extended
to him from time to time.

The Supervisor could not close this report without stating his appreciation of Mr. Frank O’Connell, our Playground
Superintendent, for his ever ready and willing assistance;
also to Mr. H. G. Heidner, Mr. M. P. Conway and the C. E.
Walker Company, for the use of victrolas and reeords used
on the closing day; the press, the Transcript and the Telegram, were most generous in giving space and news of our
city's playground.

Respectfully submitted,
P. H. KELLY,
Supervisor Municipal Playgrounds,
Season  Holyoke, Mass.

REPORT OF THE
To His Honor, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen
of the City of Holyoke, Mass. 

GENTLEMEN :—The thirty-fourth annual statement of all
matters pertaining to the Board of Health for the vear ending November is hereby submitted for your consideration:

ORGANIZATION.

The members of the Board of Health met for organization the first Monday of February,  and elected the following officers: J. Sidney Wright, Chairman: Frank A.
Woods, M. D., Seeretary; J. Joseph Carroll, M. D., Bacteniologist.

Appended are the reports of the Health Officer, Inspector of Plumbing, Inspector of Milk, Inspector of Meat
and Slaughtering, Bacternologist and Sanatorium for Tubereulosis.

Regular meetings of the Board have been held and special meetings as occasion required,

SCHOOL INSPECTION.

Eternal vigilanee on the part of the school physicians in
the early detection of symptoms of communicable diseases
and prompt exclusion from school of such eases will be an
important factor in the effort to stamp out communicable
diseases.

Medical inspection is business proposition, human life
eannot be measured in dollars and cents. This is proposition worthy of the careful consideration of our City Government and the parents of Holyoke.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH  

We desire to repeat the warnings given year ago concerning the practice of removing children from houses about
to be placarded. During the year several cases have come
to our notice where children have taken up temporary res)dence with families whose children have continued to attend
school. Unfortunately the parents do not realize that all this
tends to defeat the ends for which we are working in isolating these diseases, that of preventing contagion.

We desire to call the attention of physicians to the fact
that they have not complied with the requirements of the
law when they report cases of contagious diseases by telephone. It is their duty to fill out the cards with the necessary information and immediately forward them to the

Board of Health.
ONLY COLD.

A common cold or little sore throat in young children
should be viewed seriously. The first symptoms of measles
and whooping cough are generally hard eold. In diphtheria and scarlet fever it is often ‘‘just little sore throat.’’
If vour child has cold or sore throat do not send him to
school. By so doing you are endangering the health and
lives of the other children. It is much better for one child
to lose day or two from school than expose probably hundreds of other children to the danger of infection. [f marked
improvement is not shown in day or two, send for the doctor.

OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM.

Twenty-six eases of ophthalmia neonatorum were reported during the year. The prevention of blindness from
the menace of ophthalmia neonatorum and the preservation
of evesight is one of the most important duties instructed to
the Board of Health. If the case cannot be properly treated
and cared for at home it is sent to hospital or eve infirmary
for treatment.

  REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH
TUBERCULOSIS.

Tuberculosis is not comparable to the aeute infectious
diseases. Its evolution is slow and its spread not very rapid.
The public should be led to believe that it presents problem to meet sensibly, that spitting promiscuously is dangerous and passing of handkerehiefs, glasses or other articles
from the mouth of one person to that of another is not only

. unelean but risky.

It is just as much of nuisance to the public, if not
more so, for the tubercular person to expectorate in the street
as it is for him to spit on the sidewalk or floor.

Kindness to the consumptive should impel us to regard
him, not as pestilence, contact with which surely infects us,
but as one who is unfortunate and one who should be encouraged to learn how he ean improve and how he can avoid
transferring his disease to others. Above all he should not
be made to feel that. because he has tuberculosis he must exert himself no more. He owes duty to the community
fully as much as the community owes one to him.

VITAL STATISTICS.

The total number of death certificates filed during the
vear and the total number of burial permits issued was  ,
not including still-births.

In connection with the burial of these bodies, loeal permits and transit permits were Issued, bodies
were brought to Holyoke for burial for which transfer permits were Issued.

Based upon the census of the Water Department for
 which gives Holyoke population of  the death
rate is  .

Deducting the deaths of non-residenis in institutions we find true death rate of  .

The following tables give the details of the deaths and

— still-births for the vear ending November .

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH  
IMPORTANT TO HOUSEHOLDERS.
Keeping Milk Cool.

Milk should be the only food of infants under one year
of age. If the cow, milk and utensils in which milk is received and kept are clean and the milk is kept cold, below
fiftv degrees Fahrenheit. 

Milk should be brought into the house in clean and
healthful condition. It is one of the most perishable of
foods. If milk is kept in warm room when it is received in
the home it will rapidly turn into poor food, even before
it becomes sour. Therefore it should be placed on ice immediately upon receiving it and kept in the coolest part of the
house.

GARBAGE AND REFUSE.

There are hundreds of premises in the city without any
proper receptacle for ashes and refuse. The city ordinance
requires that they shall be provided. At various times many
premises have been provided with receptacles, but they have
not been suitable for continued use, some being too flimsy
and nearly all of them portable. If such receptacles are
preferred, the expense of replacing the broken and  stolen
ones should be expected and provided for.

MILK INSPECTION.

This branch of public health work has been conducted in
substantially the same manner as during the past seven years
and with the same end in view, to secure for this city clean,
fresh and healthful milk supply as well as one that would
not fall below the standards prescribed by law.

ICE CREAM.

In the summer months Inspections were frequently made
of places where ice cream is manufactured and of retail
stores and whenever improvements were deemed necessary
they were carried out.

  REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH
MILK STATIONS.
The name is misnomer for although one of the attractions offered is the supply of milk of known quantity either
free or at nominal cost as conditions warrant, the most effective work is that given in consultations to mothers. There
is no doubt of its tremendous asset in public health work.
INSPECTORS.
We again renew our request for more inspectors that
we may be able to meet the demand for better housing econditions, regular imspeetions of bakeries, restaurants and
other places where food is prepared and sold. This lack of
adequate help prevents our giving these important matters
the attention they deserve.
THE EMPLOYEES.
All the employees have done good, conseientious work.
In spite of the faet that the number of our employees has
not been increased in proportion to the growth of the eity,
and in spite of the consequent inerease of the work, no complaint has been heard on the part of any of the members of :
the staff and the clerks and inspectors have continued their
extra work with their usual willingness and application ta
duty.

obtained are very satisfactory to all concerned.

The city has had the distinction of being exempt from
the “‘Hoof and Mouth Disease,’’ which has been so prevalent
if the cities and towns round about us. strict quarantine
Was maintained during the epidemic, and extra and unusual
precautions taken to guard our eltizens against the eontagion.

Report of the Bacteriologist
To the Honorable, the Board of Health:

GENTLEMEN: herewith submit my report for the year
ending November :

There has been tremendous inerease in the work done
in the laboratory during the past year, there having been
  examinations made which is far in exeess of the total
number made in any one year im the past.

DIPHTHERIA.

I have examined cultures this year. Of these  
were for diagnosis, were positive and negative. The
balance,  were release cultures.

For several years past your Board has required two consecutive negative release swabs in all cases of diphtheria, and
now as further precaution would suggest that in the future that two negative swabs should be required from the
nares as well as from the throat. This would serve to give
greater protection against transmission of the disease, because
as vou well know the nares may harbor the organism long
after the throat becomes free. .

I would further suggest that your Board adopt rule to
the effect that the second release swab be taken by physician to be designated by you.

TUBERCULOSIS.

During the year have examined specimens of
sputum for tubercle bacilli. Of this number were positive and negative. This is higher percentage of positives than is usually the case, and tends to show that the
physicians do not take advantage of the laboratory facilities

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH  
which your Board has placed at their disposal in order to
ald them in the diagnosis of doubtful eases.

TYPHOID.

Nine specimens of blood have been examined for typhoid,

all of which were negative.
OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM.

Five smears taken from discharging eves of infants were
all found to be negative.

Appended you will find tabulated list of the work accomplished during the year.

In conclusion wish to thank vour Board and its attaches for their courtesy extended to me during the year.

REPORT OF THE
Board of ark Commissioners
To the Honorable the Mayor and Board of Aldermen
of the City of Holyoke:

GENTLEMEN: We submit herewith the annual report of
the Board of Park Commissioners for the vear with a
schedule of the receipts and expenditures and recoimmendations for the coming year.

Although no large improvements have been accomplished
this year, no appropriation having been made for same, the
Board has carried along improvements as far as their general appropriation would allow, principally the grading at
Fairfield Avenue Park and the improvements at Prospect and
Riverside Park.

The expenditures of the Board have been ,
$  having been expended for maintenance and
$  for improvements.

We give herewith review of the work by parks with
recommendations.

HAMPDEN PARK.
| This park has been kept in the usual good condition this
year. Flower beds are set out here and the walks and grass
eared for in very satisfactory manner. The tree belt on the
Maple street side was cut off, the curbing moved in and the
roadway extended to cover the walk opposite the New Central Fire Station, these changes being necessary for the accommodation of the fire apparatus.
PROSPECT PARK.

While considerable rough grading was done at this park

early in the year, having been made necessary on account of

  REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS
the new walks placed in the park, large amount still remains to be finished, and an effort will be made the coming
year to complete this work and re-seed the park. The new
concrete walks are giving great satisfaction here, and simi- )
lar walk should replace the sidewalk bordering Prospect
street, as the old tar walk is in dangerous condition and
detracts from the good appearance of the park. The new
shelter for women and children was completed this year, and
a new sewer constructed. This shelter will be opened the
coming spring and the old shelter at High street remodeled
for the use of men. New lights should be placed on the. parapet wall and flower beds and drinking fountains installed,
also surface pipes for watering, and an appropriation for the
above improvements is urgently requested. —
ELMWOOD PARK.

Nothing in the line of improvements was accomplished
here, the grass and flower beds were kept up in the usual
good condition. The Board would hke to have the development on this park carried along, and for this purpose would
advise as in former reports the building of the bridge across
the ‘‘Dingle’’ at Pine and Jackson streets. This matter has
been presented by the Planning Board. The city engineer is
also working on plans for the same, and the next year should
see start made as this improvement is the key to the future
development of this section of the park. The Bh street
playground is badly in need of grading to provide better
facilities for ball fields and athletic grounds for this section.

RIVERSIDE PARK.

This park continues to be one of the most popular of our
outing places, the wading pool proving great attraction
for the children, and the ball fields for the older boys. A

skating rink is also provided during the winter months. A
new wire fence was constructed along Main street to provide
a safeguard to the people, and especially the children using

REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS  
the park from accidents from the traffie along Main street on
the park side. The shrubs are becoming very thick along
here and obstructs view of the street from the park. A
rose garden has been started and old-fashioned flower beds
set out and will add greatly to the attraction of the park the
coming year. Better shelter facilities should be provided for
the women and children and more shade trees planted. The
high bank bordering on Main street at the lower end of the
park should be graded and plaeed in better condition as it
presents bad appearance to the people passing the park.

SMALLER PARKS.

. Hamilton and Germania Parks have been kept up  in
good condition as also Canonchet Park. These parks are in
thiekly populated parts of the eitv and provide very popular

: outing places during the summer months. New curbing is (
needed at Germania Park.
JONES PARK.

Nothing has been done at this park this vear. Plans
have been prepared for the development of the park, and
the Board would like to see start made. The chestnut trees
here have been affected and should be taken out and replaced

 with other trees. new entranee should be furnished for
the park and pathways and roads constructed. The above
improvements would tend to bring the people to this park
and acquaint them with the natural attractions here.

FATRFIELD AVENUE PARK.

This was regraded and seeded in the spring and new
flower beds will be added the coming vear. The old shrubs
should be taken out and replaced with lower growing shrubs.
New lighting fixtures were installed and the wires placed
underground.

BRIDGES.

During the very cold weather in the early part of the
year  ice pushed the center pier of the first level canal |
bridge on Cabot street out of position, dropping the bridge
and buckling one of the trusses.

After temporary repairs had been made, the Holyoke

. Street Railway Company was ordered by the Engineer of the
Railroad Commission to stop running their ears over the
bridge, as it was not considered safe.

Early in January of this year His Honor, Mavor John H.

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER

Woods, requested your engineer to make plans for strengthening the bridge so that street railway traffic might be resumed. After considerable study the present plan was evolved
and on submission to the Engineer of the Publie Service Commission was duly approved.

The strenethening consists of two sets of Bethlehem girder
beams spanning from the abutments to the center pier and
resting on the cross girders of the bridge. These replace some
of the old stringers under the floor. In addition to strengthening the floor the eenter pier is also held in place avainst ordinary ice thrust, the girders acting as struts against the abutments. New under flooring and top flooring were also put in.

The total cost of repairs was .

Congestion of traffic on Ihgh and Dwight streets is thus
relieved.

Following the annual inspeetion in July recommendations were made for scraping and painting several of the
eity’s bridges. Similar recommendations have been made by
your engmeer and by his predecessor for number of years.
Iron work exposed to the elements and not protected by paint
or otherwise corrodes and deteriorates rapidly.

With modern conveyances travel over our bridges is becoming heavier vear after vear. It would, therefore, be the |
part of wisdom to use ordinary precaution by preserving the
steel members on which the safety of the whole structure of
the bridge depends.

Provision should be made in the annual budget so that
the recommendations to the Board of Public Works in my letter of July ean be acted upon in the near future.

Plans were made at the request of the Planning Board
for bmdge in Elmwood Park, near Pine strect. Exclusive
of the fill and the eost of the culvert necessary to take care of
the storm water sewer from Oakdale and the winter flow of
the Dry Brook it  estimated that this bridge will cost approxnately ,

It might be well in this connection to state that the average cost of the bridges over the canals in Holyoke, exclusive of
the wooden bridges, is .

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER  
PAVEMENTS.

Sheet asphalt, block asphalt, Roman road and reeut gran- ,
ite block pavements were built during the year, adding total
of feet or miles to our permanent roadways. |

The pohey adopted by the city of placing concrete base
under all pavements will prove wisest in the long run. Without the conerete base the surface becomes very uneven under
heavy travel and deteriorates rapidly.

. Of the streets treated this vear with sheet asphalt your
attention is particularly directed to Hampden street where
Roman road was laid. This pavement consists of six inches
of concrete mixed in the proportion of one part Portland cement, two and one-half parts sand and five parts broken stone
with one-half inch asphaltic wearing surfaee. It is similar
in construction to the Hassam pavement laid in Maple street
and will undoubtedly give good service.

The granite block pavement from Sargeant street to Jackson street on the east side and from Sargeant street to the
Third Level Canal on the west side of Main street was this
vear recut and relaid on concrete base. Reeut gramite block
laid on concrete base with sand cushion is the pavement of
the future. The Bronx district in New York is one of the first
places in the country where recut block was used. street
paved by this method in is in first-class condition today.
Hundreds of thousands of yards have been laid all over the
country  recent years.

Durability is one of the essential requirements in all
pavements and it is an accepted fact that no material will
stand the wear of heavy traffic better than granite. With
present day methods of laying all the essentials of good pavement have been attained.

It is durable, smooth, sanitary, and affords good foothold
to horses. The cost of maintenance is practically nothing.

Pavements which have given twenty-five or thirty vears’
service may by the reeutting method give additional service
for an indefinitely longer period and at one-half the cost of
any other permanent pavement.

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER
EXCAVATIONS AND PAVEMENTS.

 Necessary excavations for conduits of various kinds are
often made in pavement to the great detriment of the street
surface. To obviate this trouble it might be well to determine
as early as possible the streets to be treated during the coming
season. Advance notification would give opportunity to the
companies and departments having pipes or conduits to make
necessary installations in these streets so that the work of pavIng can begin early in the season. The additional advantage
wowd be gained of minimizing unsightly and dangerous
breaks in the pavement.

SEWERS.

Ordinary extensions of sewers to accommodate buildings
in the newly developed tract of land west of Northampton
street as well as new properties in other parts of the city
were built this vear.

The big work of the vear, however, was the Highland
Park System, where the demands became annually more urgent to relieve conditions. Only small percentage of that
district could be served by the  -inch pipe which runs into
the Pleasant street dingle, with no provision for surface
drainage.

The system consists of large collecting main into which
lateral sewers run from the several streets with an outlet to
the river under the B. M. Railroad near Jones’ Pond.
Only such portions were built this year as were necessary to
accommodate the built-up section.

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER

During violent thunder storm in August portion of
the Front Street sewer collapsed in that section bounded by
the Hl. W. R. R.. the Farr Alpaea property and the Ger. mania Mills. During the repairs an examination of the sewer
developed the fact that the invert brick at the bottom of the
sewer were badly worn. It is surmised that the same condition may be found for considerable distance either way
from the break so that further collapses may be expected from
time to time.

Eventually the culvert in the Maple street dingle wil!
be extended to the South street eulvert and connected with
the  -foot sewer under the Germania Mill.

Building operations in the Germania mill necessitated
some changes In sewer construction. The old union basin was
lowered and the conduit extended to the location of Hancock
street where new receiving basin was built. The Front
street six-foot sewer, the Elmwood three-foot. six-inch
( -foot  -inch) sewer and the storm water channel are now
connected into this receiving basin.

Following is list of sewers bwilt during the vear:

ASSESSORS.

Maps of the new tracts of land which are being developed west of Northampton street were prepared for the asSESSOTS.

They are of the same dimensions as those prepared by the
late James M. Sickman for the Board in the early nineties.
They include the tracts known as Fairmont, Brookline, Elinhurst, Hilleroft and Homestead Gardens.

NEW SANITARIES.

Plans were prepared for enlarging and remodelling the
old sanitaries in the Hamilton Street School by extending the
building to the park line at the rear.

This plan was abandoned as the cost was prohibitory and
new sanitaries were built in the basement from plans and
specifications made in this office.

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER

Plans and estimates were made for public sanitaries and
a waiting station in the City Hall basement. An entrance with
stairs was provided from the High street side of the building
to the general waiting room, and another entrance from the
allev on the south side.

A general plan of the Citv Hall basement showing the
present lavout was prepared, and from this plans were developed for new offices for the Gas and Electric Department.

WATER DEPARTMENT.

A map of the city showing the location of all water mains.
gates and hydrants is now being prepared in this offiee for
the use of the Fire Department.

Fifty days of the City Engineer’s time and that of one
‘assistant were constuned in the ease of Young vs. The City of
Holvoke.

HOUSE NUMBERS.

Numbers were assigned to many new houses in the outlying distriets as well as to new apartments completed during
the vear. |

SURVEYS.

Cross sections of Northampton, Dwight and Hampden
streets were made to determine the quantity of exeavation
made in the preparation for paving. Stakes were set for the
finished grades of all streets paved during the vear.

 Appleton street. between Maple and High street. and
ITampden street near Schoo] street were widened to give more
room for travel between the ear tracks and the curve.

These were needed improvements.

The leneth, kind and average cost of the curbing and
sidewalks Jaid during the vear are shown in the following
table:

SIDEWALKS.

This is the first year in the history of the city in which
tar concrete was entirely excluded in the construction of new
sidewalks. The substitution of cement concrete is step in
the right direction.

Although the initial cost is larger, yet the maintenance,
a negligible quantity in eement walks, brings the final eost of
tar walks as high, if not higher, than cement, the latter having
the additional advantages of neat appearance, smooth surface and durability.

About three miles of new walks were laid during the
year.

ELEVATOR INSPECTION.

The passage of an act by the Legislature rezulating the
installation and inspection of elevators has relieved the state
officials of these duties and thrown the burden on the cities
and towns.

In August we received  -pave book of regulations and
blank forms containing to questions to be answered

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER

for each elevator inspected. Letters received from several
mayors state that specially trained mechanics have been employed to earry out the provisions of the law in their cities.

Holvoke has about elevators to be inspected annually,
and in addition all operators must be examined and licensed.
As only those who are licensed can operate, large number of
certificates will be required in factories where many of the
operatives are allowed to run the freight and passenger elevators. Eventually license fees will, no doubt, help materially
to meet the expenses of this branch of the department. Provision must be made, however, in the annual appropriation to
cover the expense for this vear.

INSPECTION OF BUILDINGS.

During the year tests of reinforced conerete beams were
made under the direction of the city engineer, to determine
the streneth of beams inehes deep, inehes wide and  

 feet in length, for clear span of feet.

Reinforcement inches wide of Clinton Wire Cloth with
longitudinal members  -inch diameter, inches center to
center and transverse members of  -ineh diameter  -inch
center to center was used in one beam.

American Steel Wire Company’s  -inch triangular
mesh with No. gauge steel wires to each longitudinal eable
and No. gauge cross wires cables wide was used in another beam.

The proportions of the conerete aggregates were part
Portland Cement, parts seleeted sand, and parts broken
trap rock.

In the Clinton beam the wire cloth was set on curve
  inch from the top at both ends and inches from the top
at the middle of the heam. test was made of these beams
on May  the concrete being days old and of very good
quality.

The Clinton beam was placed on supports feet apart
clear span and Joaded with bags of eement, so arranged as to
leave space of about inches between adjoining bags.

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER  

Cracks began to appear on the bottom of the slab at a
loading of pounds. deflection from the horizontal of
 inches was noted with load of pounds. This load
was then removed and the permanent deflection measured  
inches from the horizontal.

On reloading the beam collapsed at pounds, distributed load. The reinforcement appears to have been strained, as the conerete broke and parted at the bottom with no
signs of erushing at the top.

Using factor of safety of the beam has safe carrying
eapacity of pounds, distributed load per square foot.

Under similar test the following deflections for distributed loadings were noted in the beam reinforeed with Amerlean Steel Wire:

At pounds loading,  -inch deflection.

At pounds loading,  -inch deflection.

At pounds loading,  -inch detleetion.

At pounds loading,  -inch deflection.

At pounds loading, total collapse.

At the pounds loading transverse eracks showed on
the bottom feet each side of center beam, and at  
pounds loading the top of concrete erushed and bottom separated. It was difficult in this case to determine the eondition of the reinforcement as to elasticity, the conerete being
badly erushed at the top of the beam.

Using the same factor of safety of the safe distributed
load for this slab is pounds per square foot.

The position of the wire in each slab was found to have
changed (probably due to tamping during the process of filling the forms) from inch to  inches above the bottom in
the case of the Clinton Wire Cloth, and from inch to  
inches in the American Steel Wire Slab. This difference in
position will account for the difference of breaking loads in
the two beams.

The wire was not broken in either beam, the concrete having collapsed in each ease.

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER

Using the utinost care to maintain the reinforcement in
its proper position and in the mixing and placing of the conerete safe distributed load of not more than pounds per
square foot is permissible with d-inch slab, used as plain
beam supported at both ends. safe load of pounds
is permissible where one end of the beam is continuous, and
a safe load of pounds is permissible when the beam  continuous over both supports. When supported on all four
sides safe load of pounds is permissible to square foot,
if the longest distance between supports is feet.

ELECTRIC WIRING.
Practically all new buildings erected during the year and
a large number of old buildings were wired for electricity.
The requirement in relation to the grounding of transformer secondaries was an important addition to the Electrieal Code.
When coils come into electric contact by the breaking
down of the insulation in transformer, the high voltage primary current flows to the secondary coil.

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER
Grounding the secondary, however, prevents this dangerous condition and gives the additional advantage of detecting
leaks or grounds in the secondary system. case came under observation during this year, where the grounded service
in one building showed serious ground in building five
hundred feet away.

REPORT OF THE
Dealer of Weights and Measures
For THe FiscAL YEAR ENDING NOVEMBER .
Lo the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen:

GENTLEMEN: have the honor to present to you the
ninth annual report of the Sealer of Weights and Measures
Department of the city of Holyoke, for the fiseal year ending
November .

I would respectively recommend the purchase of an automobile for this department. The ealls and demands on the
sealer, outside of regular inspection tours, are growing so numerous, that think it would be time and money saver for
the eity, besides being better accommodation to those requiring the sealer.

I wish to thank the city officials, the manufacturers and
the merchants for the courteous manner in which have been
received by all, in the discharge of my duties. detailed report of the work performed and inventory of the office equipment is herewith presented.

Sealer.

Report of the City Auditor
To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen:

GENTLEMEN: present herewith the annual statement
of the receipts and expenditures for the fiscal year  in
the form and manner required by the State of Massachusetts.

I have audited the accounts of the City Clerk, Inspector
of Milk, Water and Gas and Electric plants, found them correct, the receipts properly recorded and promptly deposited
and the expenditures in the Water and Gas Departments approved in due form. The Tax Collector's books have been
audited as far as possible; the postings in his accounts reach
the thousands, and as each is separately checked, it takes a
long time to complete his accounts.

The report also contains detailed statement of the expenditures in the Contingent account, and those of the offices which formerly were included in this appropriation but
which, since April  have been met by specific appropriations to those offices.

There is likewise shown the salaries formerly included
under that general head, but which like the Contingent have
also been separated by specific appropriations.

There is further shown detailed statement of the city’s
indebtedness, sinking funds, Tax Collector’s exhibit, Sewer
and Sidewalk Assessments, the bonds issued during the year
with the purpose for which they were issued, the cash on hand
and the borrowing capacity.

There was borrowed during the year  for the following purposes: Playgrounds, Central Engine
House, City Hall Annex, New High School,
$ Sewers Construction, Hamilton Street

  REPORT OF CITY AUDITOR |
School, City Farm Additions, Sidewalks
Construction, Highways Construction, Relief department (an emergency issue), Gas and
Electric Construction, but of the surplus left at
the end of the year  was transferred to the bond payment account to meet the  borrowed for the Relief
department which falls due next April.

Payments on the City Debt and additions to the sinking
funds during the year were as follows: City Debt Serial
Bonds paid from taxation, City Debt from Sinking Fund, Gas and Electric Plant Debt, ;
Water Debt, Holyoke and Westfield Railroad Debt,
$ payments to City Debt Sinking Fund, ,
and earnings Water Debt Sinking Fund, 
and earnings transfer from surplus to City Debt
Bond Payment Account grand total payments, earnings and transfer, total bonds issued, ;
excess of payments over loans, .

The borrowing capacity is an increase over
  of .

Respectfully submitted,
DANIEL W. KENNEY,
City Auditor.

The Maintenance of the Water, Gas and Electric departments are not
included in the foregoing diagram because those departments maintain themselves without any cost to the taxpayers.
As matter of fact the Water Department pays annually about 
a year net to the city in taxes, while the Gas Department, by its low rates
for lighting and power and the maintenance of certain lights at its own expense, contributes its share towards lessening the taxpayer’s burden.
Respectfully,
D. W. KENNEY,
City Auditor,
City of Holyoke.

While the number of women arrested is smaller than last
vear, am sorry to say that drunkenness still claims many
victims. large number of disreputable places have been
broken up during the year, some of the inmates have gone
to prison, others have been placed in institutions where it  s
hoped that they may reform.

RECOMMENDATIONS.
I respectfully recommend that you appoint ten additional
patrolmen to this department. In my opinion we have not
enough men to properly cover the city. We have an area of

  REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF POLICE
twenty-three square miles, containing eighty-five miles of
streets and roads. This is covered from eight until four p. m.
by fourteen patrolmen and one sergeant on the street; from
four p. m., we have the same number of nen; from seven
p. m. until twelve a. m., we have twenty-eight men and two
sergeants on the street; from twelve a. m. until three a. m.,
we have twenty-five men and two sergeants; from three a. m.
until eight a. m., eleven men and one sergeant.

This detail was made out before became connected with
this department, and after considerable study do not think

: it can be improved upon, as you can readily see we have a
greater number of men on the street from seven p. m. until
three a. m. than at any other time during the twenty-four
hours, because it is between those hours that burglaries and
night prowling is more often practiced than at any other
time.

Some of the territory or posts covered by one patrolman
is so large that it is impossible to give it proper attention m
all its parts.

The Highlands, Highland Park, Elmwood, Oakdale,
Springdale and Ingleside are not properly protected. The
mill district from the County Bridge to Sargeant street on
the second and third level canals is not properly protected.
These conditions demand some remedy, hence my request for
additional men.

ASSISTANT MATRON.

I respectfully request that an assistant matron be appointed to this department. As it  now the present matron
has been called in several times during the past year to attend
a female prisoner, and has been required to stav with her or
within eall for as long period as sixty hours. The matron
is supposed to make half hour ealls to the cell room when
any one is confined there, and it seems an imposition to require her to be on duty forty-eight or sixty hours at time.

REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF POLICE aol
CLERK.

I respectfully recommend that you appoint male clerk,
(preferably young man) to this department, one who has
mastered the typewriter and shorthand. We are in need of
such clerk, as contemplate filing system for this department in all its branches. This clerk can also serve in cases
of statements or confessions by prisoners and witnesses, also
in court cases. This has seldom been done; the members of
the department are at present depending on such notes as
they can jot down and rely on their memory for the balance;
there are many other such cases such as are mentioned above
where this clerk could be used.

AUTOMOBILE PATROL.

It is my opinion that our present automobile patrol is a
great bill of expense to this department on account of its
construction, which is touring car and truck combined,
that  s, heavy truck body on chassis running gear. Its construction is such that it is top heavy and when loaded is constantly breaking the light axles with which it is equipped,
three being broken in the last year. The wear and tear on
the tires is fifty per cent more than it should be. It has been
run miles to date, miles in the last year. The repairs on this car for the last year amount to this
included the cost of general overhauling and painting last
spring. .

The additional automobile and team hire amounts to
$ .

I respectfully recommend that you purchase an up-todate hght police automobile of standard manufacture to be
used on long trips, especially the trips to Springfield which
are made almost daily.

Also that you purchase for this department five passenger touring ear, as the needs of such conveyance is evident by the bills for our automobile hire.

D  REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF POLICE
CONCLUSION.

On behalf of this department wish to express thanks.
to His Honor, Mayor John H. Woods, the members of the
Board of Aldermen, the Judge and Clerk of the Police Court
for the many favors and courtesies extended to the department during the year.

I also wish to express my appreciation to the officers and
members of the department for their assistance to me, and
for the faithful manner in which they have performed their
several duties. :

Respectfully submitted,
JOHN R. HARRINGTON,
Marshal.

REPORT OF THE
Board of Public Works
To the Honorable, the Mayor and Members of the Board
of Aldermen of the City of Holyoke, Mass.:

GENTLEMEN :—Submitted herewith is the report of the
Board of Public Works, covering the fiscal year ending November which the Board trusts you will examine
carefully and find correct, and that it will also be to your satisfaction.

All of the work performed by the Department during
the year is covered by the tables annexed hereto, and perusal of the same will give you full information as to the cost
of the work performed and the balances brought over from
  and also earned forward to the year  .

Your advice and co-operation will always be appreciated
by the Department, as has been stated in reports of previous
years.

The total credits, including appropriations by taxation
and from loans, amounted to which does not include the balance brought from  amounting to making the total receipts from all sources .
For maintenance and construction there was expended #$ and balance is carried to of The
last named amount is divided principally among the accounts
of Bridge Construction, Central Fire Station, City Hall Annex
and Police Building and High School Gymnasium Building.

There was expended for the City Hall Annex and Police
Building during the year, for the Central Fire
Station for the High School Gymnasium, of which amount  was expended by the
School Department for equipment of the building.

oot REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS

During the year the Cabot Street first level canal bridge
was repaired and placed in safe operating condition for the
sum of the City being reimbursed by the Holyoke
Street Railway Company to the extent of The
second level canal bridge on Cabot street remains in practically the same condition as noted in our last report, and the
condition of the Lyman street bridges have not been mate| rially changed, although during the annual shut-down, socalled, the bridges were braced and strengthened to certain
extent, rendering them safe as they could be made. The
Board is still, however, of the opinion that as soon as the
financial condition of the city will warrant, these bridges
should be replaced by more modern structures, as has been
recommended in the past.

The matter of painting bridges has been brought to the
attention of the Mayor and Board of Aldermen for some time,
and many of them are still in serious need of repainting. It
is to the mind of the Board good practice to keep the iron, work of all our bridges painted and entirely free from rust
and seale, in that the rusting of iron-work causes it to deteriorate rapidly and ean only be prevented by thorough scrapIng, or cleaning and painting.

The condition of the East Dwight street footbridge is
such that especial attention should be given it the coming
year. Something must be done to strengthen this bridge —
Which will prevent accidents in the future. The bridge, we
believe, was never intended to earry the heavy loads that at
times it is required to earry at present, but it is serious
question how to regulate traffie on this bridge.

Permament improvements have been made on the roadways on Hampden street between Maple street and School
street, on Northampton street between Limeoln street and
Bh street, on Dwight street from Northampton street to
Ivy avenue, on Main street between the third level canal bridge
and Sargeant street, with the exception of the east side of
Main street between Jackson street and Canal street, and on
Cabot street between Canal street and Main street, while MaREPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS 
ple street between Dwight street and Hampden street was resurfaced and practically made new, which will give satisfactory and good wearing surface to this street for many years
to come.

The work done on Main street this year completes modern roadway from the West Springfield line to the heart of
the city, something that has been needed for many years.

The Board again calls your attention to the necessity
and advisability of purchasing land from the Holyoke Water
Power Company on Commercial street between the present
City Yard property and Sargeant street, for use in connection with the street department, and for the storage of materials such as trap rock, brick, asphalt, sewer pipe, lumber,
eurbing and all other materials used for work in the department. It is believed that considerable amount could be
saved each year in the loading and unloading of materials
with proper facilities and equipment which could be constructed and placed on this site.

It is also desired to purchase, and the obtaining of
proper equipment is an urgent necessity for this department,
such as cement conerete mixers and hot asphaltic mixers. In
this connection the Board should be provided with large
boom concrete mixer for laying foundations for pavements
and other like concrete work, and also with smaller mixer
for laying concrete sidewalk work and for the construction
of cement concrete sewers, which in many instanees can be
built cheaper than brick or vitrified pipe sewers of the same
size.

A self-dumping automobile truck for the transportation
of street, sewer and sidewalk materials is an urgent necessity,
and by the purchase of this the city would be in position to
make sizable saving over the present system of haulage.

A new automobile is required to replace the present No.
  ear, Which for many years has given good service, but which
has outlived its usefulness on account of its expensive upkeep at the present time.

One of the most important minor improvements aecomO  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
plished this year was the widening of Appleton street by
eliminating the tree belt on the south side between High
street and Maple street, adding materially to the width of
the roadway and to the appearance of the street.

It is advisable to extend the pavement on Northampton
street from Bh street or Cherry street, as far as the top of
the Whiting Hill, so-called, or as far as money can be provided to extend this pavement, even to the Springfield Road.

Something should be done to place permanent form of
roadway on Sargeant Street between High Street and Northampton street, which will necessitate the placing of considerable curbing.

A new form of roadway must be provided for Ely street
between Bowers street and North Summer street and on Main
street, east side, from Jackson street to the third level canal )
bridge the pavement must be completed. It is also recommended that new pavement be placed on Dwight street from
the Holyoke and Westfield Railroad tracks to Main street, as
the brick pavement now on the street is badly worn after
many years’ service. We believe there are enough granite
blocks remaining from the work of paving Main street to pave
John street between High street and Front street.

The pavement on Hampden street should be extended
from School street to the intersection of Lincoln street and
Hampden street, and Hitchcock street from the Westfield
Road to Hillside Avenue should be paved and curbed in order
to complete the permanent roadway between the Westfield
road and Northampton street. The use of South Canal street,
between Cabot street and Jackson street will necessitate improving this portion of the street the coming year.

New sanitaries on the boys’ side of the Nonotuck street
school must be installed during  and proper appropriation should be provided.

The additional expense in alleys in over was
necessitated by the increase in wages of the permanent men,
and also the additional cost of garbage collection beimg ecarried through the entire year, whereas in the contract ran

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS do 
from May to November only, and it will be necessary to contract again during the coming year for garbage
disposal for another term.

The Board believes that under the present system
whereby re-payments for materials and labor furnished in
the doing of work for private parties and corporations, such
as the making of sewer connections and other like work, is
diverted from the department which pays the expense into
the general receipt account, it will be advisable to establish
the coming year fund or an appropriation sufficient in
amount to care for this work rather than to pay the cost
thereof from any individual or particular department. Repairs to streets necessitated by the opening made by the Water
Department, Gas and Electric Department, New England
Telephone and Telegraph Company, and the Holyoke Street
Railway Company during the year cost approximately
$ :

Your attention is also called to the adoption of the two
weeks’ vacation act for laborers at the last state election, which
will necessitate an additional expenditure in this department
of between  and  at the lowest estimate that the
Board is able to make at the present time.

The Board renews its suggestion for the installation of
modern electric lighting systems in the Hamilton street,
Springdale, Kirtland, West street and Park street school
buildings.
