MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
To THE HONoRABLE BOARD OF ALDERMEN:
I eannot start the third vear of my official life as Mayor
of Holyoke without saying that am grateful to her fine people for the unusual indorsement given me at. the election.
I sincerely hope that my acts of the year will reflect
honor and eredit upon them and our fine city. You, too,
must enter the new year in spirit of gratitude, for the people have given to you the honors vou sought. Let us not disappoint them, or give them any reason to regret having chosen |
us.
FINANCES
Bonds amounting to  were issued during the ,
year for the following purposes :
Highways .....   t   es 
SewerS ... cc             ete teens  
Sidewalks .... ..  ... ee   eens :

  MAYOR'S ADDRESS

Payments on the debt were made amounting to ,
as follows:

City Debt, H. W. R. R. Debt, Water
Debt,  (includes  added to the Sinking Fund) ;

Gas and Electric Plant, excess of loans over payments, .

The total net debt is  as against 
last year, an increase of This does not include the
Temporary Loans which this year are as against
$  last year, lessening of .

The borrowing capacity is  as against 
last year; decrease of |

The city closed the year by meeting all its obligations ,
and having surplus of .

Unemployment of the past year may be said to have
wholly governed the financial policy of the administration.
State and National Governments made appeals to the cities
that were as clear and urgent as those that came during the
war. Holyoke made answer to those appeals; public works
of larger character than usual were undertaken, and thereby
employment was furnished to those who, otherwise, would
have suffered severely. At the same time the city was greatly
benefited by the construction of new highways and repairs
of others.

Unemployment of almost the same proportion still prevails, and while am hopeful that industrial eonditions will
improve, we must always be prepared to meet situation
like that which has confronted us at all times durimg the past
year. In connection with this phase of our affairs, urge you
to read carefully the reports of our City Engineer and Board

. of Public Works, and especially the latter, with reference to ,
|

a
| MAYOR’S ADDRESS  
roads and bridges and recommendations therein, which I
endorse.
There are several matters with which we are concerned
that will require special legislation, and am preparing to
introduce bills into the State Legislature with reference to
them. |

First, believe consolidation of the Park Board and
Playground Commission will eliminate dual work of the same
character and will provide more efficient and economical management.

Secondly, the Easthampton road should be finished from
the point completed this year under the supervision of the
State, under the same financial arrangement with the State —
and County.

Thirdly, the work of the Child Welfare Commission has
been an inspiration. No department of our City Government
has given the high character of service as has this commission. This work of saving helpless infants from the results
of improper care and inability of mothers to furnish nourishment is, indeed, most important one. Legislation that will
remove any chance for legal barrier must be sought.

The Police Department is in need of more men. For
the past few years reserve officers have been employed steadily. Many complaints are made of inadequate police protection from property owners and from those in the residential )
sections. There are not enough patrolmen. recommend an
addition of ten men.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion must express my appreciation of the

spirit of co-operation that has been shown by the city officials
‘

  MAYOR'S ADDRESS
and the various city departments.. The year was one
that brought severe tests on municipalities everywhere, and
our city has been no exception. During this difficult period
all the departments of our city government have functioned in —
a way to produce an efficient administration of your affairs.
There is every reason to hope for continuance of this
harmonious working together for the best interests of the
city, and the citizens properly look to us to use every effort to
give an efficient and economical. administration during  .

“  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER
BRIDGES

For several years past the dangerous condition of the
bridges over the canals has been the subject of report and recommendation by the City sngineer. Replacing them could no
longer be postponed without endangering the lives and property of the public. Originally designed to meet conditions
then existing, the older bridges became inadequate and unsafe for modern auto truck transportation. It was decided
to rebuild the two Lyman Street bridges, the Second Level
Appleton Street bridge, the Jackson Street and the Valley ,
Bridge this year. Contracts were awarded to M. J. Walsh
& Sons for the Jackson Street and the Upper Lyman Street
bridges, to Walsh’s Holyoke Steam Boiler Works for the Appleton Street bridge, and to the  O. Hoyt Construction
Company for the Valley bridge.

Work on the first three is well advanced toward completion and preparatory work is under way for the Valley
bridge. Owing to the delay in procuring plans for the
changes in the pier of the Boston Maine Railroad bridge,
bids have not been called for the construction of the Second
Level Canal bridge on Lyman street.

Examination of the steel of the Willimansett bridge over
the Connecticut river has revealed condition which needs immediate attention. In the near future it is proposed to build
permanent floors on the. Willimansett and South Hadley
Falls bridges over the Connecticut river. Closing the bridge
to travel during construction of concrete floor on the South
Hadley Falls County bridge has been strongly opposed by interests on both sides of the river. Construction was delayed
during the past year to make further studies so that travel
eould be maintained while permanent floor was being placed.

To bring these bridges up to the requirements of the
Publie Utilities Commission may require some additional steel
reinforeement in the trusses and floor beams.

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER  d

The bridges on Cabot street over the first and second
level canals should be rebuilt to meet the growing needs of
the city. ,

In the upper canal bridge was strengthened and
street railway travel resumed on Cabot street. Since this
bridge was reinforced it has proved of ample strength to
carry all travel, both street railway and ordinary traffic.
There is always source of danger, however, in travel over

| this bridge, on account of the roadway between the trusses
. being too narrow for the passage of car and truck at the
same time. This condition has been emphasized since the
double running boards were placed on the street cars. If the
fire apparatus tried to pass car stalled on one of those

bridges the result would be disastrous.

Plans of the new pier for the Jackson Street, second
level canal bridge, were hurriedly prepared and the construction was completed during the annual shut-down. Casper
Ranger Company started work on Sunday morning, drove
sheet piling, built forms, removed old foundations and completed the pouring of concrete just as the water reached its
full height in the canals on Wednesday night. |

The first and second level canal bridges on Cabot street

) and the second level canal bridge on Sargeant street must be
replaced in the near future. The money has already been
provided for strengthening and paving the county bridges
over the Connecticut river. When this work is done very
dangerous condition will have been eliminated and the annual maintenance of the city’s bridges reduced to minimum.

The City Engineer attended legislative hearings in the
State House at Boston in March and April, presenting maps

| and data showing the inaccessibility of the new Springfield
bridge to the citizens of Holyoke.

The City Engineer had several conferences with the officials of the Boston Maine Railroad and the Holyoke Water

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER
Power Company relative to the construction of the new
bridges over the canals. ;
The Public Utilities Commission gave several hearings at
Boston on the petition of the Holyoke Street Railway Company in reference to the floor construction which the Town
of South Hadley contracted to place on the South Hadley
Falls bridge. These meetings were attended by the City
Engineer.
A set of plans of the Willimansett Bridge across the |
Connecticut river was obtained from the Clerk of Courts at 
Springfield for the files of the City Engineering Department REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER  
PAVEMENTS

This year considerable amount of permanent pavement
was built. Reinforced concrete was used for the first time in
some of this work. the small additional outlay for steel reinforcement in concrete paving will prove to be very economleal as far as maintenance of the pavement is concerned. Re'  inforecement prevents expansion and contraction cracks which,
heretofore, have developed in concrete pavements constructed
without reinforcement.

The Springfield Road from the West Springfield line to.

St. Vincent street was repaved with reinforced concrete  
inches in thickness, to replace the asphaltic top which had
| outlived its usefulness.

The Upper Springfield Road, from the Underpass to the
top of Whiting’s Hill, was reconstructed, embankment retaining walls built, steep grades eliminated and permanent
paving placed on the street.

After preparing several plans for new road to eliminate the sharp corners and steep inclines on the Rock Valley
Road, route was finally selected with maximum grade of
  per cent to run from the top of the hill across bray’s Pond
and to connect with the Westfield Road near the entrance gate
to Ashley Ponds.

The rough grading on the new road is practically complete. It is proposed to build surface of macadam. The
trap rock needed for this construction can be procured and
erushed at small expense, as the road is built through trap
rock formation.

Plans for the proposed extension of High street southerly from Norfolk street were prepared and stakes set showing the proposed location of the street. The project includes
in general the extension of High street feet wide to meet
South street produced, at or near Ross avenue. plan has
been suggested which would obviate the necessity of acquiring
additional land for extension. By changing the car tracks

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER

from Maple to High street as far as Norfolk street and on
Norfolk street to Maple street the street railway would then
serve all that portion of High street available for business
purposes as far as Elmwood Park. Should the Park Commissioners build driveway across the park from Norfolk
street to Ross avenue as at present laid out, all travel in that
part of the city would be well provided for at minimum cost. .

PARKING SPACE ,

Providing parking space for automobiles on business |
streets and at the same time giving sufficient room for moving traffic is problem in Holyoke, as in other cities.

A very much needed improvement was made during the
year in widening the roadway on Maple street from Dwight
to Appleton street.

There are other streets, however, in the business district where the congestion is very pronounced at certain hours.
Among them might be named Dwight street from High street
to Elm street, Suffolk street from Railroad to Walnut street,
Newton Place, City Hall Place, Railroad street, Appleton .
street from Maple street to Chestnut street, Chestnut street

 from Appleton to Dwight street, Elm street from Appleton
street to Dwight street.

Widening the roadway will partly relieve congestion in
some of these streets, but other methods must be found for
streets in which sidewalks are barely wide enough for pedestrians. |

It has been suggested that the curbing be set back to the
inside line of the sidewalks abutting the park on Dwight
street, Chestnut and Hampden streets, to provide parking
space around Tampden Park. As there are two parallel
walks on Dwight street and Hampden street, it is claimed
that the outer walk could be eliminated and the inner or park
walk used instead. This would provide space for parking,
give additional width to the traveled way and would not detract from the heanty and usefulness of the park.

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER  :
DISPOSAL OF WASTE
The time is fast approaching when the city must provide suitable location for the disposal of its waste. About
  cubic yards is collected annually, large part of which
finds its way to the hollow in Elmwood Park. The space to
be filled in the park, if the present grading between Pine and
Maple streets is continued, has maximum capacity of approximately cubic yards, or less than one and one-half
years’ collection. If we add to this probable cubic
-- yards west of Pine street the Elmwood Park dingle will be ,
filled in little less than three years. ,
This matter has been under consideration for several
years, and the present seems to be the time for directing the
attention of the Mayor and the Board of Aldermen to this
important problem. |
MISCELLANEOUS WORK.
Plans and specifications were prepared for new sanitaries
in the Park Street and Elmwood schools, and for electric wir- |
ing in the Sargeant and Park Street schools.
Specifications for painting the interior of the High School
were furnished.
Monthly samples of water from the Connecticut river,.
above the dam, were collected for the State Board of Health.
Surveys of various lots to determine lines and areas to
be assessed were made for the Board of Assessors.
Preliminary maps were furnished the Fire Department
. for renumbering the fire alarm boxes in the city.
Precinct maps, showing the number of voters in each ;
. block or square in the city, were prepared for the use of the
Board of Registrars for the redistricting of the city.
Cross sections of the land on which the new buildings at
the City Farm are now located were prepared for the use of
the architects. The engineering connected with the layout
and setting guides was done by this Department.

d+ REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER
The quinquennial perambulation of the town lines was
made with the officials of the adjoining towns, and all monu. ments and other markings were found in good condition.
Maps of all pieces of land under the charge of the city
were prepared for the use of the Board of Public Works.
The City Engineer attended the hearing given by the
Government Engineers at the Mahogany Room in the Municipal Building in Springfield to parties interested in the de. velopment of the Connecticut river at Windsor Locks. It
was shown that the maximum height petitioned for in one of
the schemes would practically submerge the city from the
) first level canal to the river.

REPORT OF THE
e i]
Fire Commissioners.
Devember .
To THE Honorable Mayor aNXND BoARD OF ALDERMEN :

GENTLEMEN: We respectfully submit to you, im aecordance with the City Ordinance, the report of the Fire Department for the year ending November .

The Board of Fire Commissioners, consisting of Arthur
E. French, David Clark and Joseph C. Doyle, met on January
 th to organize. Arthur E. French was eleeted Chairman,
and David Clark, Vice-Chairman.

We regret to report that our losses this vear have execeded
those of other years, owing to the disastrous fire on March  th
at the Judd Paper Company, which was well under way before
it was discovered. The fire spread to the blocks along Mam
Street, making total loss of over well constructed fire wall on the H. G. Sears Co. building prevented
a much greater loss. The fire was discovered at a. m.,
and both platoons were on duty continuously for two days.
We wish to again thank the H. G. Sears Company for their
kindness in supplying hot ecotfee and lunch for the firemen.
Eight firemen were injured or overcome while on dutv at
the fire. )

The Department answered to alarms of fire, the greatest number in the history of the Department. This mav be
partly explained by the large number of bridge fires. The

 Department responded to fires on the various bridges.
The month of June was particularly prominent. in this respect,
@ .

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS
when the Department responded to alarms for bridge fires.
This epidemic was lessened’ in the months to follow through
the efforts of the Board of Public Works in sending the sprinkler over the county bridges frequently during the day. While
the Department has been very fortunate in the past in extinguishing bridge fires at minimum loss, there is always danger |
of such blaze getting so much headway as to cause the loss
of one of the bridges, on which there is no insurance and which
would mean large outlay to the taxpayers to replace it. This
danger might well be eliminated by putting on non-combusti- ,
ble pavement or flooring. :

The total fire loss during the year was  .- |
  on buildings, and  on contents. This large
loss on contents is due chiefly to the loss on the stock and the
large amount of furniture that was stored at the Judd building. Of this loss insurance companies paid leav- ]
ing net loss of an average of  fire, which
is very high average. The average total less per fire was
* The gross loss per capita was and the net per
capita loss was, .

The largest fires during the vear were as follows:
Judd Paper Company ............. 
Max Smith, shoe store  ...  
Chemical Paper Co. .....  ...    
Emil Dreicorn, Chapin St... .....  
Daniel O'Connell Sons Co., barns.............  

A part of the uninsured loss may be accounted for by
the two fires at our public schools, neither of whieh was insured. There was loss of about  on the Ewingville
School, and  on the South Chestnut Street School.

We regret to report two deaths by fire during the vear..
Kazinney Polehlopelk, Hampden street, one vear old, died
of aecidental burns of chest and arms on December ,
and Josephine Trela, Race Street, three vears of age, died

.

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS  
-of accidental burns of face, neck, chest and arm on September
  On neither of these oecasions was the Department
called for fire.

The Department is fortunate this year in that none of its
members have died. The Department has been strengthened
by the appointment of three permanent members, viz: Jolin 
J. Cadigan, John B. Choquette and Bernard L. Sheehan.
Peter T. Gately resigned as call stoker and Jeremiah J. Hogan
was appointed in his place.

The Board of Fire Commissioners instituted some very

  important improvements durmg the year, one of which was
the extension of the Fire Alarm System to the Smiths Ferry
District. This section has been doing considerable building
during the past few years, and, upon petition of the Smiths
Ferry Improvement Society, the Board, after an investigation, ordered that the extension be made. This extension is
to eost the Department but very small amount as the Gas
and Electrie Departinent and the New England Telephone and
Telegraph Co. have agreed to do all the construction work.
Two fire alarm boxes have been purchased to be placed near
the Holyoke Country Club and the Holyoke Canoe Club, and
at the same time, the Holvoke Surgical Ho-pital purchased a
private box for its protection.

One of the most important improvements the Department
has made in many vears has been developed by the Board this
year; that  s, the renumbering and redistricting of the fire .
alarm boxes. This was brought about through the reeommendation of Chief IIurlev, who pointed out the weaknesses
in the eld numbering, in which Box was to be found at
Mount Saint Vincent at the southerly end of the eitv; box
  at Nonotuck and Fairfield Avenue at the northerly end
of the city box at the City Almshouse, again at the southern section; and Upper Northampton Street. box  at. the
extreme opposite end of the city. This system was at times
very confusing, and it was especially difficult for new members

ys

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS
to memorize the lovations of the boxes. Under the uew system.
the city has been divided into four districts. The section
bounded by Maple Street on the west and Appleton Street on
the south is District  Distriet is bounded on the north
by Appleton Street and on the west by Maple and South
Streets. Districts and are west of Districts and  and
are divided by Appleton Street to Dwight Street, Dwight
Street to Northampton Street, The first number of each box
indicates in which district the fire  located. For instance,
bex is in District  in District  in Distriet  ,
and  in District  In this way, the men know by the first
digit of the box number, in just which direction to go. The
numbers, as far as possible, have been placed in sequen e,  .
that, for example, we have box at High and Lyman Streets,
box at INgh and Hampden Streets, box at Hign and
Dwight Streets, ete. This enables the men to memorize the
locations much more easily, and may mean the correetion of
error the receiving and sending out of an alarm, owing to
the fact that if box  Main and Sargeant Streets, came in |
or was sent out  the apparatus would at least be within
a short distance of the fire, and its location would be discovered, which, under the old system, was practieally impossible. :
Arrangements were made, when making up the numbers, to.
) leave out numbers in certain sections where box may be
needed in the future, so that when the time comes, box may |
be installed without interfering with the present sequence.
The Board also passed an order during the year to the ,
effeet that all members shall attend drill school during thesummer months, under the supervision of the Drill Master,
until they have been in the Department five years, and that
each company shall conduet house drill once week. These
drills have been conducted’ more or less regularly in the past,. |
but this order of the Board makes the work imperative. Housedrills are conducted every Monday and Friday.

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS  

The only apparatus purchased during the year was an
automobile for the Chief. The new machine was exchanged
at net cost of twelve hundred dollars for the Chief’s car,
which had been in the Department nearly two years.

We wish to thank the Board of Water Commissioners for
their co-operation with us during the past year, when, at our
request, they installed new hydrants at the Mount Tom and
South Holyoke Stations and in the Ingleside district

We would eall particular attention this year to the condition of our horses. During the past year, one pair of horses
became useless, and we were obliged to discard them, and to.
take the pair of spares that we loaned to the Board of Public
Works, to be used in their places. This leaves us in very
bad condition in this respect, in that we have no spare horses:
to fall back on, and the fact that the four horses thafwe have
In service at the present time average each about twenty years.
of age. In the days before we had motor apparatus, we rarely
kept horse that was more than fifteen or sixteen years old,
as after that age they cannot be depended upon. These horses
are at an age now when they become disabled after the slightest amount of work. We have recommended for many years
that the Department be completely motorized, and now that
this conditon has been brought out so forcibly, we believe the
time to be ripe for some definite action in this respect. It will
mean an outlay of twelve hundred dollars this coming year
to replace those four horses.

We respectfully recommend the following for your con
sideration :

( In line with the above facts, we recommend the
purchase of two motor-driven hook and ladder trucks; one to

| be placed in Elmwood, and the other at the Highland Station..
We repeat our advice of last year that the Department. is:
losing the services of four men, who are obliged to stay with
the horses after having responded to an alarm. The salaries
of these four men plus the cost of keeping the horses, amounts

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS :
to approximately ten thousand dollars year. When this fact
is taken into consideration in conjunction with knowledge
of the condition of the horses at the present time, we believe
that the above recommendation is an economic one.
( We recommend that the present wood floors at the
Highland and South Holyoke Stations be replaced by concrete
floors. There is at. least one piece of motor apparatus in each
of these stations, and this improvement should be made if
for no other reason than that it is required by the State Law.
The State Law specifically states that floors upon which motor
vehicles are kept must be conerete, and we are in direct violation of that law under the present conditions. The floors of
the Mount Tom and Elmwood stations were done two years
ago and the necessity was no greater than at the two stations
mentioned in our recommendation.
( We recommend that the stalls in the South Holvoke
and the Highland stations be removed. This should be done
in connection with recommendation No.  .
( We recommend the purehase of non-interfering
fire alarm boxes to replace the old Gardiner boxes, some of
which have been in service over forty years, and which cannot |
be depended upon.
( We again recommend that the traffie rules be |
amended so that street cars shall stop on the near side of |
the street. This regulation would prevent serious accidents !
that are liable to occur under the present regulations. |

  REPORT OF FIRE COM MISSIONERS
In both of the above accounts, we have ‘‘new hose’’
| account. This is because we received it short time before the
writing of this report, and it had not been disturbed. We purchased feet of hose this year; feet of  inch
and feet of inch. Commencing with this year we are
to have hose test semi-annually, instead of annually, as heretofore. During these tests, we were obliged to condemn  
feet of inch hose, besides sending feet, which was
too porous for use, back to the factory to be relined. Much
more of the hose that is now in service is unsafe, but we
hope, by purchasing about feet vear, to be able to
displace the poorest of it.

ANNUAL REPORT
Holyoke Pl dC ISSI
O yo aygroun Ommission
 
'l'O THE HonNorABLE MAYorR AND THE BOARD OF ALDERMEN OF
THE City oF HOLYOKE.

Gentlemen: We beg to present the report of Supervisor
P. H. Kelly, which sets forth in detail, the activities under the
direction of your Commission.

We respectfully call your attention to what we believe to
be the great needs of the department, viz.: An open-air
swimming pool; new equipment on some of the grounds, to
replace the apparatus which has been in use for years:
greater opportunity for reereation for adults. We recommend the purchase of property adjoining the Morgan grounds.
We also recommend that the eity purchase the so-called Ball
tract on Northampton strect, for playground and recreational
purposes,

Respectfully submitted,
PLAYGROUND COMMISSION,
ARCHIBALD A. BROOKS,
Chairman.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ,
Supervisor of the Holyoke Playgrounds
For ,
To THE HONORABLE BoarD OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS :

Herewith respectfully submit my tenth annual report
as supervisor of the Holyoke Playgrounds for the season of
 .

That the playgrounds have become regular and indispensable part of the community is shown by the great interest of the parents, and the eagerness with which the children
await the opening each year. The aim of the department is
to provide play and recreational facilities for boys and girls
up to the working age, where natural, normal play-life can
be carried on under the direction of trained play-leaders. The
activities are of great variety, mecting the needs and desires
of the different. classes and groups of children in attendance.

Great credit is due the directors and their assistants for the
interest shown, also for the able manner in which the games
were presented by them. The activities adopted were those
that provided for the greatest number, and eatered to the
need of the whole play community.

I. SUPERVISOR

The summer season of our playgrounds opened July  ,

and closed August  covering period of eight weeks. The

  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS
work was similar to that of other years, which consists of sewing, darning, crochet work, millinery, basketry (reed and
raffia), chair caning, folk dancing and games, conducted as
follows:
A. At school yards:
Elm Street, Hamilton, Kirtland, Springdale, Morgan and William Whiting.
B. At public parks:
Highland Park. .
C. At public playgrounds:
Elmwood, Maple Street, Hampden Street, West
Street and Prospect Field.
D. At bath house and shower baths:
Ward Four and Whiting School.
The past year has been one of unusual interest and activity. The attendance has broken all previous records, being
the largest in the history of our playgrounds. There was an
evident increase in the number of older boys and girls that
daily visited the grounds. The cause, no doubt, being the
searcity of work and the large number of unemployed at this |
time. |
|
II. PHYSICAL EDUCATION FOR GIRLS |
The primary aim of the Playground Department is to !
provide, through its buildings, recreation fields and skating
rinks, an opportunity for physical improvement and mental
relaxation. This encourages and promotes the practice of indulging in beneficial sports and games. Moreover, such ,
course aids in developing courage, self-respect, admiration
of skill, sense of justice, and, above all, love of fair play.

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
At the end of the season, the girls participated in the closing field-day events. The unusual enthusiasm shown in all
of the activities by the girls was evidence of how thoroughly
they enjoyed and appreciated the work. During the past
year, as always, we have striven for the social betterment of
the many rather than the individual development of few.
When referring to the playgrounds one naturally thinks of
play as the sole object in view. This is only partly true, for
the activities of the well regulated and thuroughly supervised playground are many. They touch almost every phase
of life, and are not only means of entertaining and amusing
the children, but are potent factors in guiding the children to
higher moral, social and economic lines. believe that, next
to our public school system, the public playgrounds are the |
most potent force of our modern democracy. On the playgrounds we are endeavoring to teach assimilation rather than
precept or preaching, and find that the youth will come to the
playground of his own accord and learn the lesson of fair
play by association with his fellow players. This lesson,
learned best of all in childhood on playgrounds, is taken
through life, and will have great bearing on the lives of our
citizens of the future.
Til. FOLK DANCING
Mary A. McCormick, SUPERVISOR. |
Folk dancing continued to be the most popular activity
of the younger girls. The daily dancing period under the
eareful instruction of Miss McCormick, increased in popularity. Each playground was visited twice week by the
Supervisor, and one hour each day was devoted to folk daneing on each of the playgrounds. Girls like dancing better
than any other form of play, and their instinct is not at
fault. Folk dancing combines many elements of expression,
and when so developed as to give room for originality, affords
a wider avenue of growth than perhaps any other form of

  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS
play of either sex. It has the physiological merits of the best
gymnasties, produces the exhilaration effect that comes from
calling out all the physical resources in natural way. Dancing is the first of the arts and the most intimate parent of all
the rest and most available for the great majority of the people. It is the inmost circle of emotional expression, the first
and most exuberant utterance of the joy of life.

IV. INDUSTRIAL WORK
BASKETRY AND CHAIR CANING
Miss Bribe C. HERBERT, SUPERVISOR

 This department has shown wonderful advancement under the supervision of Miss Bride C. Herbert, who deserves
great credit for the work accomplished. The suecess was not
alone in the amount of work completed but also in the quality
of the work. The aim during the season has been to improve
the quality of the work along all lines. The exhibit at the
close of the season demonstrated how faithfully the teachers
and pupils worked to this end. The girls on the playground
were divided into two groups, the elementary and the advaneed. With this plan and the co-operation of the girls with
their teacher, greater results were accomplished. Picture

frames, napkin rings, whisk broom holders, and book marks
were made by the younger children. Braided raffia work
brought forth mats, dolls’ hats, teapot mats and baskets. The
knotted work consisted of bags for twine and fancy work
bags lined with silk. The sewed baskets made of raffia and
reed were beautifully designed, and proved valuable additions to many homes. Pine needle baskets of all shapes and
designs were turned out by the older girls. Pine needles made
a very attractive basket and were in good demand. Woven reed
formed the most attractive trays. For these trays wooden.
base is used, and the foundation is made attractive by the use
of cretonne under the glass. They were stained to match the
lining and were considered the best articles made on our playerounds.

Chair caning increases every year. This is very popular occupation for boys, although girl is never refused the
privilege of caning should she desire to do so. The boys were

| furnished with the cane and were allowed to cane as many
chairs as they pleased.
V. SEWING DEPARTMENT
. Mrs. May Kostrensaper, SUPERVISOR

Sewing on our playground has been found practical and
satisfactory. Each season the interest in the work increases,
and new ideas are constantly introduced. As in previous
years, instructions in the needle arts were given daily on all
play centers. Each playground was visited once week by
the Supervisor, who plans and designs the work. The usual
sewing course covered the fundamentals of sewing. The
simpler work for the younger girls and the more difficult
for the older girls. The garments to be made are those most
suited to the girl, each process of construction following logieal order until the garment is finished. Many useful garments were made, such as aprons, dresses, middy blouses and

VI. SKATING AND SLIDING
Four skating rinks were maintained during the winter
months as follows: Hampden Street, West Street, Joseph
Metcalf School and Newton's Pond. Skating surfaces on the
small ponds were planed and seraped and kept in good condition for the children. Owing to the extra mild winter, the
ice on Newton's Pond was not of sufficient thickness to permit
the use of horses to scrape and plane the surface, and danger
signs were posted, warning skaters to keep off, except during
about four weeks of the winter season. Electrie lights were
installed at each rink and, with caretaker in charge, every
effort. was made to keep the rinks in good condition, and the
best of order was maintained. Sliding on Suffolk street was
enjoyed by thousands of boys and girls during the evenings.
This proved popular pastime. Permission was granted by
the Board of Public Works to close this street from School —
street to Walnut during the hours from to P. M. Caretakers were in charge, and the surface was kept in good condition when the weather permitted. .
VIT. EVENING SESSIONS
Five Playgrounds: Elmwood, Maple Street, Hampden
Street, Morgan School and West Street were opened evenings
. with supervised play from to P. M. during the
months of July and August. Many young people and older
folks who work during the day visited our playgrounds and
obtained much-needed recreation. The playgrounds selected
for the evening sessions were those located in the thickly

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  
populated section of our city. Advantage of the extra hour of
daylight was taken by all persons seeking outdoor recreation.
During the evening hours the baseball diamonds on the va-
rious fields were used exclusively by those who were employed
during the day. The young men and women joined in the
different games and athletics. Big brothers and sisters played
in the same game with their smaller brothers and sisters.
Many mothers and fathers visited with their children and
joined in the games or used the apparatus. The evening ses- sions proved more popular than ever. During the eight weeks
that the playgrounds were open the total attendance was  The average nightly attendance for the five grounds
was  .

VIII. BAND CONCERTS AND BLOCK DANCING
A new feature which furnished great deal of pleasure
and recreation to the public and was appreciated alike by all
classes, was the block dancing held in connection with the
band concerts. Besides being novelty they were great success. They were held on Wednesday evenings from to
 Band concerts on West Street and Springdale grounds,

block dances on Dwight street, from Linden to Pine streets, —
Brown avenue from Willow to Laurel streets, Pine street
from Sargeant to Hampshire streets, Sargeant street from
Summer to East streets. Musie was furnished by the Holyoke City Band and Ameriean Legion Band, and was under
the control of this Board. The best of supervision was maintained, and the daneing was enjoyed by thousands of people.

The younger folks especially enjoyed the dancing. Many of the older boys and girls were seen giving the younger ones
their first dancing lesson, and fathers and mothers watched
the couples executing the new steps, and apparently wondered what had become of the old waltz and polka. The public followed the schedule closely. going from place to place to

  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS
take part in the dancing. believe that no other fund pro vided by the City Government contributed so much pleasure
and enjoyment to the people as that appropriated for band
eoneerts and block dancing.
IX. BASEBALL LEAGUES

The national pastime, as might be expected, was the most
popular game on our local playgrounds. During the summer
months our baseball diamonds were in constant use in the
afternoon and evening on week days, also on holidays and
Sundays. The past season there were more organized baseball
teams than ever before in the history of baseball in the city.
The City League, which is the center of attraction for the
thousands of Holyoke fans, had most successful season under the management of Mr. Thomas McCullough. schedule
of games was completed, of which were played on the
West. Street and Prospect Fields. The leadership of the
league was not decided until the last game of the season, keeping the interest at high pitch and resulting in many close
games. Bascball diamonds were in much demand this season
and many requests from independent teams for the use of the
grounds were refused, as all the available diamonds were in
use. There is an urgent need for more baseball fields in many
sections of the city.

Following is hst of the baseball games played on our
playgrounds by the different organized leagues and independent teams, together with an estimate of the attendance. This
does not include the Playground League and hundreds of
games plaved by the youngsters.

X. SWIMMING AND BATHING

Since our Playground Department has been begging
for better swimming facilities. In that year there were three
( bath houses under the direction of this Department.
There now remains but one lone bath house in Ward Four,
which is crowded to capacity during the summer months.

It should be realized that swimming is the most enjoyable and health-giving recreation that the children may participate in, and every child should be given the opportunity
to learn. It also should be taken into consideration that when
the children cannot have the chance to swim in bath houses
under the supervision of capable instructors, they will turn
to swimming in the river, which is dangerous practice. Although it is hoped that this branch will be taken care of year
after year, the building of more bath houses is suggested but
nothing in the way of funds to construct them has
materialized.

XI. ATTENDANCE

The attendance this year has broken all previous records,
being the largest in the history of our playgrounds. There
was an evident increase in the number of older boys and girls
that daily visited the grounds. The cause, no doubt, being the
scarcity of work and the large number of unemployed at this
time.

XII. PLAYGROUND BASEBALL

Baseball is the most popular of all sports participated in
on-our playgrounds. At the start of the season three leagues
were organized. The Midgets, Junior and Senior Leagues.
The grounds represented were the Elmwood, Maple Street,
Whiting School, Hampden Street, West Street and Morgan
School. The Midgets played schedule of thirty games. The
games were played on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.
The Junior and Senior Leagues played schedule of sixty |
games. Each of the Junior games were played on Alonday,
Wednesday and Friday mornings, and the Senior League
games were played on Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoons. total of one hundred and fifty games were played,
representing different boys. Fast, clean baseball characterized all the games, and great interest was shown in each
league. The games were witnessed by thousands of spectators
and friends of the boys. The West Street grounds carried
off the honors in the three leagues.

XIII. SPECIAL EVENTS

The special events which were held during the season are
all worthy of mention. At the opening of the season meeting of the directors and workers was held and plans for the
season’s special events were talked over. It was decided to
hold such events as Dolls’ Day, Carnival Day, Mothers’ Day,

  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS
Movie Day and Baby’s Day. The results were very gratify-ing. Each director planned her program and looked after all
of the details and in many cases co-operation from the people in the neighborhood was the means of making these special
days very successful. Hundreds of people have witnessed
and participated in these events. The policy has been to have 
the celebrations on school centers as well as on the large playgrounds. Some were held indoors and others out in the open.
The baby parade was the most popular event held and
brought out the largest attendance.
XIV. FIELD DAY
The annual field day, which, in former years, was held.
on the Springdale Park, was changed this year. The event
was held on the Hampden Street Playgrounds, Wednesday,
August  th, and proved very successful, as over two thousand children, with their parents, attended. This event is
looked forward to with great interest each year, as all compete for the championship of the city in their respective divisions, the Midgets, Juniors and Seniors. The program consists of relay races, ladder race, return races,  and  yard dashes. First, second and third prizes were awarded the |
, winners in cach event. Six playgrounds were represented, and
the grounds scoring the greatest number of points received a
silver cup. This was presented by the Playground Commission and was won by Hampden Street Playgrounds.

XV. WEEKLY CONFERENCES :
With the idea of having the best possible organization,
and the highest efficiency in the work of the playground instructors, weekly conference was held throughout the season, meeting every Monday morning at the Playground Office.
Talks were given on the playground organization and administration by the Supervisor. The directors and workers fully
realize the importance and responsibility connected with their
positions and aware of the tendency of the children to imitate
them in their habits of sph and manner, have displayed
tact, patience and good judgement at all times. Their effective
work in organizing teams, teaching athletics and games, promoting play in all its features, added materially to the usefulness of the playgrounds.
XVI. REPAIRS AND EQUIPMENT ,
During the past season number of much-needed repairs
were made and new equipment installed on our playgrounds.
. Prospect FIELD
The baseball field on this ground was harrowed and
rolled and put in fair condition; the blhers were repaired
and painted.
HAMPDEN STREET
. The old wooden swings which had done service since
this playground first opened were removed and new sct of
twelve iron swings were installed.
West STREET
The blhers on the embankment of the west side of this
ground were entirely gone over, new post supports were placed
In the ground and new plank seats were put in to replace
| those that had rotted or which had to be replaced. Some of

|
  REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS
the wooden swings were removed and six new iron swings
and new slide were installed. The baseball diamond was
harrowed, resurfaced and rolled.
MorGAN STREET
The wooden swings on this ground were repaired and
strengthened and new slide added.
XVII. RECOMMENDATIONS
Swimming: The problem of better bathing facilities is :
one of the important matters that will require the attention
of the Commissioners the coming year. At present we have !
but one bath house where children can swim. would sug- !
gest that special appropriation be asked for this purpose
and at least one bath house be erected each year until all sections are provided for.
Baseball Fields: Baseball interests more boys than any
other sport, and at nominal eost. Baseball diamonds are
in great demand. would recommend that an athletic field in
the Highlands be purchased, as it may be obtained more reasonable now than later.
Handball courts are in great demand im all sections of
the city, not alone for boys, but active men are calling for
them. Arrangements should be made to erect handball courts
on West Strect and the Elmwood Playgrounds.
I would suggest that public-spirited citizens might well
be reminded by the Commissioners that there is no gift that
ean be made to the city of greater use and enjoyment, with
more lasting honor to the name of the donor, than the gift of
land for publie playground.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT ,
A few words of acknowledgment are due to those interested in the ever-growing sentiment for hetter play in HolI

REPORT OF PLAYGROUND COMMISSIONERS  d
yoke. The splendid spirit of the corps of instructors and |
hearty co-operation of the various city departments, private
concerns and individuals, helped to make the playground season of stand out prominently in real achievements.

Special thanks are due the School Board for granting
the use of school buildings and grounds for play purposes,
and to the Park Board for its generous co-operation in permitting the use of parks for play and band concerts.

A word of thanks must be extended to the Falco Athletic
Association for the use of Berkshire Street grounds for playground baseball. The Holyoke Transcript and the Telegram,
the Springfield Republican, the Union and Daily News
splendidly supported the playgrounds, and were generous
with space given to playground news, which was greatly appreciated by this department.

In closing my report, wish to extend my sincere thanks 
to the members of the Playground Commission for their
hearty support and co-operation in working out the details
for the development of our playgrounds.

I also wish to express my sincere appreciation of our

 Superintendent, Mr. M. J. Gleason, for his untiring efforts
and ever-willing assistance.
Respectfully submitted,
P. H. KELLY, Supervisor.

"REPORT OF WATER BOARD  

The Board organized for the year with Mr. Thomas J.
Carmody, Chairman; Mr. James H. Dillon, Vice-Chairman,
and Mr. Hugh McLean, Treasurer, being the same organization as for the preceding year.

Although the cost of materials and labor was only slightly
reduced, about the same amount of construction work was
completed by the Department as in other years since the prewar period. The  main from the foot of Whitineg’s Hill on
Northampton street to the end of the  main at Mount St.
Vincent was replaced this year by  main. On account
of the fact that concrete roadway was being constructed on
this part of Northampton street the Board was foreed to buy
the pipe early in the season in an unfavorable market, so as
not to delay the construction of this highway. An  branch,
connecting this main from point near the principal building
at the City Farm with the main on Griffin’s Hill. now permits
the extension of the High Service System and greatly improved fire protection to the buildings at Mt. Marie and
Brightside as well as to the buildings at the City Farm and
Mt. St. Vincent. new hydrant was installed in the lower
Ingleside District at the request of the Board of Fire Commissioners, and the water supply features in that section of
the city are now entirely satisfactory.

The report of the Superintendent of this Department to
us, which is made part of this report, shows in the usual
detail the work accomplished during the year, and it is respectfully referred to you for further information concerning
construction work and statistical tables of Rainfall, Storage
in Reservoirs, ete.

In the matter of reducing the difference between the
amount which the water-takers pay into the general treasury
as taxes and what is paid by the city to the Water Department for water rents, the first steps were taken this year.
This balance is too heavily in favor of the general treasury,

and is much more than the water-takers ought equitably to be

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD 
made to pay, increasing from about  in to 
in  An act, seeking to have the hydrant rental increased
from  to  per year, was introduced into the Gen- |
eral Court, but, after conference with the Committee of the
Board of Aldermen, it was agreed to lay the matter over for |
another year. In justice to the water-takers, the city ought
to pay reasonable part of the cost of providing the water
for fire protection. petition was received from the Water
Commissioners of the town of West Springfield, asking that |
this Department consider furnishing them half million gallons or more of water daily, either from the Fomer main or
from the distribution main at the town line near Brightside.
After due investigation of our resources and careful consideration of our own needs, this Board offered to enter into a
contract to furnish the town the required quantities from our
surplus water for five-year period at price somewhat
greater than our present rates for metered water, but considerably lower than the town has been paying others. Our
proposition has been neither accepted nor rejected, and the
matter is still pending.
Proposed rules and regulations for the installation and
maintenance of water supplies for private fire protection, ineluding charges for the same, were drawn up by the Board
during the year, and hearing granted to interested parties. ,
At the request of the manufacturers and others, final action
was delayed until the parties affected by the proposed rules
have been given an opportunity to fully consider the matters
involved. committee representing them is still in conference with this Board.
The petition of the Holyoke Water Power Company to
the Board of Aldermen for the closing or relocation of the )
Old Ferry Road was opposed by this Board on account of the
fact that, if the petition was granted. it would further complicate the situation regarding the richt of this Department |
to retain the water main in its present location. proposi- |

REPORT OF WATER BOARD  
tion for settlement has been made, and it is likely that an
agreement will be effected between all parties concerned.

Permission, with suitable restrictions, was granted to
the Board of Public Works to construct new highway across
the Bray Reservoir and land under control of the Water
Commissioners. This highway is designed to shorten the distance to West Holyoke and to eliminate dangerous turns and
improve the excessive grades in the present highway. No
part of the cost of construction or muinteniunce is to be borne
by this Department.

Mr. Albert Pickup, who served for twenty years as Water
Registrar resigned during the year owing to  health, and
Assistant Superintendent O’Brien was appointed in his stead.
The Board places on record its appreciation of the unfailing
eourtesy which Mr. Pickup has shown the publie during all
the years he has served in that office. We also express our
thanks to his Honor, the Mayor, the Board of Aldermen and
other city officials for the courtesy and co-operation exhibited
towards this Board during the past year.

| Report of the Superintendent.
To THE HonorRABLE BoArp OF WATER COMMISSIONERS: |
Gentlemen: have the honor to submit to you the report of your Superintendent for the year  .
The consumption of water for the year was  
gallons, an average of gallons per day, and gallons per day per capita. This is gallons less than the consumption per day per capita for  .
The quantity of water sold at metered rates was about
  per cent less than last year, due mainly to depression in |
manufacturing industries; the ‘per eapita consumption of
metered water in amounting to gallons per day per |
| capita as compared with gallons per day per capita for
 .
The rainfall for eleven months of the year collected
at Rainfall Station at Ashley Ponds was inches, which |
 inches less than the rainfall collected at that station
for the corresponding period in  .
The quantity of water in storage in the loeal reservours
ern November was million gallons, which is  
million gallons less than the storage on that date in  |
The extension to the main pipe system amounted to  
feet, the details of size and loeations of which are given in
annexed table. Three hydrants were installed and four hydrants were replaced. Eighty-three new services, which is  
less than the number last year, at an average cost of ,
and services were replaced. There were leaks in mains

REPORT OF WATER BOARD lid
and leaks in services, none of which were serious. The
 property of the Department is all in excellent condition; the
exterior of the building on Commercial street was painted, 
and new concrete platform was built on the Hampshire
street side; the interior of the caretakers’ houses at Fomer
Reservoir and the White Reservoir were partly renovated, and
the barn at Fomer was covered with ‘‘Art-Craft’’ roofing.
About white pine and Scotch pine seedlings were |
set out on the Ashley water-shed, and the trees set out in
previous years continue to thrive. There is splendid opportunity for more reforestation on the Ashley water-shed, and
T recommend that during the coming year more of these trees
be set out.
Thanking you for vour co-operation and courtesy, this
report is respectfully submitted.
PATRICK GEAR,
Superintendent.

PART IL.
REPORT OF THE SCHOOL BOARD.
To His Honor, THE Mayor, AND THE CITIZENS OF HOLYOKE:

The records of the School Board should afford |
pleasent reading to the citizens truly interested in the sue:
cess and progress of the schools. They disclose well planned
program of school administration consistently adhered to.

At least they reveal nothing of that ‘‘smug complacency in
affairs’? which is the inevitable telltale of stagnation.

Easily the most sensational school happenings of the
year were the fires in the Ewingville School, and in the attic
classrooms of the South Chestnut Street School.

The Ewimeville fire occurred on January The
school was two-room, two-story red brick building, containing the first three primary grades and having membership of pupils. The fire, which was eaused by an overheated furnace, was discovered about A. M., while the
school was in session. Although the blaze was brisk one,
resulting in the partial destruction of the building, nevertheless all of the children escaped unharmed. This was due
In great measure to the excellent judgment and leadership
of Miss Mary A. Lynn, the principal, who marched the children in splendid order from the building at the very first
sien of smoke. Immediate arrangements were made for
transferring the pupils to the Nonotuck Street and Elm Street

| Schools, so that elass work continued without delay.
|
|

| REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
The South Chestnut Street School fire was potentially
the more serious. This misfortune occurred on April  ,
 The fire was located in one of the three attic classrooms in that building which had been utilized for many
years to supplement the comparatively insufficient school accommodations of the district. And when we remember the
layout of the rooms, the proximity of the exits to the scene
of the fire, the density of the smoke and the size of the blaze,
we might well reflect upon what might have happened had
the school been in session. Fortunately, however, the fire
did not break out until A. M., eight minutes after
the pupils had been dismissed for the noon recess. The fire
necessitated the removal] of the fifth and sixth grades to the
High School building; the transfer of the kindergarten to the
basement of the nearby German Reformed Church, and a
hurried renovation of the entire building. All of these
things were accomplished and class work resumed after an
intermission of only three days. The cause of the fire has
never been determined.

Following this disaster, the School Board took definite
stand against the use of attic rooms for classroom purposes.
Urgent though the need of space may be, it is too dearly
bought when it involves saerifice in the security of the lives
of innocent school children. .

Subsequently, too. the School Board voted against the
repair or rebuilding of the Ewingville School. This aetion
was taken in the interests of edueation and economy. ‘The
day of small schools in large city school systems has long
since passed. In the concentration of numbers in large —
buildings, better equipment, improved facilities, and broader
contacts, all operating for the benefit of the child, can more
easily be furnished than in the meagre narrowness of tworoom building. Then, too, the cost of maintaining this building was not only above the average of other schools, but was
altogether unnecessary since the children could be amplv
provided for in the Nonotuck Street and Elm Street Schools. |

In Which Serious Fire Occurred on April |

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

These fires had other salutary results, too. They brought
home to teachers and principals alike fresh appreciation
of the practical value ot well ordered and frequent fire drills,
and the necessity of ever being on the alert against dangers
of this kind. They caused parents, leading citizens and civic
organizations to inquire about the fire hazards in other buildings, and to study methods to overcome them. They focused
pubhe attention upon the dangerous condition in the Nonotuck Street School.

Surely after such object lessons, another year will not
pass without some attempt being made to make the Nonotuck
Street School building safe building to go to school in. It
is the earnest recommendation of this Board that modern
steam heating arrangement be installed; that sufficient.and
proper exits for building of this size be provided; and that
such changes in the interior be made as will make this .
building as nearly fireproof as possible. As it stands now,
the Nonotuck Street School is serious danger point in the
school system.

The remarkable increase in the September enrollment
brought with it the perennial question of school accommodations. Overflow conditions prevailed in several sections of
the city. The situation at the William Whiting School was
so serious that two-room portable building had to be placed
in the school yard there, and even this did not wholly remedy
matters. At the South Chestnut Street School, an entire
fifth grade had to be transferred to the Park Street School, .
and another fourth grade distributed among the Elm Street,
Kirtland and Morgan Schools—two prodings not at all
to the liking of the parents in the district. Small rest rooms
in the West Street and Sargeant Street Schools were con- |
verted into temporary classrooms, while the number of classes
well above the forty pupil mark everywhere throughout the
city was materially added to.

These conditions prompt us to inquire when the ten  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

year agitation for new intermediate and junior high school
in the central section of the city will bear fruit. ‘lhe Lawrence School, unfit. for any kind of school use, is ridiculously
unsuited for junior high school activities. Further wholesale transfers of pupils, such as were accomplished this year,
are no longer possible. two-room portable building must
be placed in the yard of the South Chestnut Street School
before next September. The High School is beginning to feel
the pinch of two grade classes in that building, and the Continuation School will never function properly until it has
quarters of its own. The William Whiting School situation
is difficult of analysis, and must surely result in an addition
to the present building unless some definite action relative
to the new building is soon taken. Evidently then, this proposed building holds the key to many vexing problems. In
view of these things, the School Board ean only recommend
that the building program outlined in its communieation to
the Board of Aldermen under date of May be undertaken as soon as possible.

It was with some regret that the Board felt unable to
approve of the plans for  school building in Smiths
Ferry. The number of children in the section did not warrant it. Then, too, for reasons explained above, it is to the
educational advantage of the children living in section with
such excellent transportation facilities as are found in Smiths
Ferry, to come to building like the Highland School, rather
than to attend poorly graded rural schoolhouse. The educational watchword of the day in schoolhouse construction is
consolidation. Holyoke cannot afford to build rural schools
whenever any other arrangement is practicable.

The West Holyoke problem must not be confounded by
this attitude, however. West Holyoke in its environment is
purely rural, and transportation is impossible. West Holyoke deserves modern two-room rural schoolhouse that can
be converted for community purposes.

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
The physical condition of the school buildings has been
materially improved over that which existed year ago. The
School Board is pleased to acknowledve the interest which the
Board of Publie Works has shown in this regard. Chief
among the improvements made are the following: Installation of new sanitaries in the Park Street and Elmwood
Schools; painting of eleven classrooms and sanitaries, and
many other minor repairs in the Highland School; installation of electric lights in the Park Street and Sargeant Street
Schools; electric lights and metal ceilings in the South Chest, nut Street School; well appointed teachers’ lunchroom in
the High School; finishing off of many excellent rooms -for
shop and domestic science purposes in the basements of the
Morgan, West Street and Highland Schools; new sewing
room, teachers’ rest room and model supply room in the
| Morgan School; thoroughly up-to-date cooking kitchens in
the Joseph Metcalf, Morgan and West Street Schools; new
classroom for special classes in the Hamilton Street School ;
complete renovation of kindergarten rooms in the Highland,
West Street and Springdale Schools. Acknowledgment must
also be made to the Vocational School, which did practically
all of the ordinary printing of the Department, made fortytwo desk boxes, and ten superb cooking tables without charge,
save for the cost of material. The School Board, too, from
its slender maintenance account, caused to be repaired and
refinished practically all of the teachers’ and pupils’ desks
in the High School and in five classrooms of the Highland
School. |
These changes have added to the efficient working of the
schools, and ereated wholesome atmosphere throughout the !
system generally. Other improvements remain to be accom- |
plished, however. Most of the buildings are suffering from |
want of paint, both inside and out—the West Street School |
particularly should be redecorated. The High School should
be renovated from top to bottom and new lighting system

Installed. The work of putting in electric lights should be
continued until all of the buildings are equipped. Several
of the elementary schools are in great need of slate blackboards. Too much emphasis cannot be placed upon this

: feature of school operation. Good buildings and buildings
in good repair beget good school work. 

The total expenditures of the School Board for the year
  are as follows: Regular schools, Continuation School, The expenditure for regular schools
represents an increase of  over the figure.
This increase is due altogether to the fact that this year was
the first full year that the present salary schedule was in
force. The amount spent for maintenance and supplies exds the amount spent in for the same purpose by only
eleven dollars—a truly remarkable record when we consider
the repair work done, the additional equipment purchased,
and the extra expenses incurred as result of the fires.

On the educational side, the year was busy one. Among

the purely educational matters that the Board passed on,
after recommendation by the Superintendent, are the following:

 Acceptance of new kindergarten plan in its final
form, after year of experimentation.

 Reorganization of the junior high school program
along approved lines. )

 Extension of the practical arts work in the junior
high schools. ,

 Reorganization of the evening high school, on basis
of three sessions per week rather than four.

 Adoption of plan whereby University Extension
and Evening High School courses are conducted on co- .
operative basis.

 Introduction of cooking courses and more practical
arts work in the evening elementary schools.

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS :
‘ "

 Opening of special class for over-age and non-English speaking pupils in the Hamilton Street School.

 Addition of home nursing and cooking courses for
girls, and home repairs course for boys, to the Continuation
School curricula.

 Endorsement of the comprehensive program of
Americanization work that is being so successfully carried
out in this city.

So much activity on the part of our school executives
shows that nothing is being left undone to maintain and preserve the high standard of Holyoke schools; that Holyoke is
not lacking in edueational leadership. .

There remains to be mentioned several matters which in
a year so rich in results, seem to have only secondary importance; namely, the scientific grading of the present salary
schedule; the opening of the High School gymnasium during

. the evenings for free use by parochial schools, organized
athletic clubs, and public classes; the opening of the High
School swimming pool during the summer months for the
general use of the boys and girls of the city, under the supervision of capable instructors.

The School Board presents this report with reasonable
feeling of pride in its achievements.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT.
- To THE ScHOOoL BoarpD oF HOLYOKE:

I have the honor to submit herewith my second annual
report as Superintendent of Schools for the year  .
This is the fifty-eighth volume in the series of printed reports
issued by the School Board.

ATTENDANCE.

One of the most pleasing developments of the year was.
the large increase in the school enrollment and membership.
On December the membership of the publie day
schools, i. e., the actual number belonging, exclusive of the
Vocational and Continuation Schools, was pupils;  
more pupils than were attending the public schools on December The reasons for this unusual increase may be
thus summarized: the unemployment situation which
served to keep many pupils in school who would have otherwise gone to work; the change in the State law requiring
pupils under years of age to complete the sixth grade before
being eligible for working certificate; the normal rate
of increase in the public schools of this city which has been
fixed at two per cent. |

The topie of school enrollment and membership is provoeative of discussion. In what grades did this year’s in- .
crease occur? How does the present membership compare

: with the average annual memberships of the previous ten
years? How have the average yearly memberships of the individual schools varied during the past decade? These are
important and pertinent questions, the answers to which may

be found in the following tables:

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
FINANCES.
You have already noted in your report that the expendi| ture for regular schools during exded the figure
by and that this large difference was due to the
fact that the present salary schedule was adopted in May,
 and consequently was operative for only part of that
vear.

The estimated budget for the current year is: Regular
Schools, Continuation School, inereases of  and  respectively. The reasons
for these increases are easily stated. The large enrollment in
the day schools required the addition of several teachers to
the teaching force (three High School teachers, two grade
teachers, and three substitute teachers in charge of overflow
classes) while the program of the Continuation School must
undergo that. expansion and development which might be expected in any organization after its first year.

Your Superintendent defends this estimate as being a
inoderate one. The items cover only essential matters and no
allowance is made for emergencies or for extras of any kind.
The members of the Sehool Department are much concerned
in the welfare of our city. They recognize the limitations of
the city’s purse, the need for economy and frugal management,
and constantly practice it. They also maintain, however, that

it is futile kind of economy which would encroach upon the
proper education of our children and embarrass the School
Board in the discharge of its full duty toward both present
and future citizens.
HIGH SCHOOL FACULTY.

Few people in the city realize how radically the personnel
of the teaching force in the Iligh School has been changed
in the past two years. Since September,  nine new
teachers have joined the Iligh School faculty. These teachers have been drawn from other high schools in our New EngREPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
land cities, and have come to Holyoke with an excellent training and scholarship, and with many years of successful teaching experience. They represent high type of men and
women well fitted to supplement the splendid corps of teachers
that was already in the school. It should be emphasized also
that their acquisition was possible because of our increased
salary schedule.

The names of these teachers and the places from which
they were obtained are: Fred H. Baldwin, A.B., Commercial
Geography teacher, formerly school principal in Kearney, N.
J.,and in the Highland Junior High School in this city Henry
J. Burt, B.S., Science teacher, from Massachusetts Agricultural College and the Amherst, Mass., High School; Raymond
A. Claneey, Commercial teacher, formerly head of Commercial
Department, Leominster, Mass., High School; Edward J.
Seanlon, A.B., Commercial teacher, formerly head of the stenographie department of the Wilby High School, Waterbury,
Conn.; Charles B. Sylvester, Mathematics teacher, formerly
Principal of the South Hadley, Mass., High School, and
teacher in Pittsfield, Mass., High School; Muss Genevieve
Browne, A.M., History teacher, from the Northampton, Mlass.,
and Ansonia, Conn., High Schools; Miss Gertrude E. Dunn,
A.B., English teacher, from the Greenfield, Mass., High
School; Miss Anna G. Gorman, B.S., Domestic Science teacher,
from the Newton, Mass., High School; Miss Anna M. Laporte,
A.B., French teacher, formerly of the Holyoke High and New

Haven, Conn., High Schools.

It would be redundant to say, after reviewing this lst,
that every effort is being exerted to place over our high
school bovs and girls only the very best teachers procurable ;
to raise and maintain the standard of our high school on the
highest level.

JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL REORGANIZATION.

Perhaps the most important educational project undertakén during the vear was the reorganization of the Junior

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

High School program. By this we must not understand a
complete undoing of what existed before, but rather necessary readjustment in the natural evolution of the project.
For, as the Junior High School continues in existence, and
its reactions become more numerous, its problems and consequently the means of dealing with them become more and
more evident. Other cities have found it necessary to modify
or enlarge upon their initial organizations; some have even
felt obliged to lengthen the school day in order to achieve
the ends they were striving for. For the present at least,
however, we did not think it wise or necessary to change from
the conventional five-hour day. Some of the leading features
of the new organization, together with copy of the time
schedule and the program of studies, are given below.

 The number of periods in the school day has been
reduced from seven of forty minutes each to five fifty-four
minute periods, exclusive of the morning and the noon day
recesses. This has had the effect of lessening the number of
class changes for the pupil under the departmentalized plan
and of simplifying an otherwise complicated and heavily
taxed schedule.

 Each period is divided into two parts: The first |
thirty-four minutes are devoted to recitation of the day's
lesson; the last twenty minutes to studying the lesson for :
the next day. During this supervised study period so-called,
the teacher has an opportunity to teach the pupil how to
study, (a very fundamental thing at this stage of the pupil’s
training), to earefully assign the lesson for the following
day, and to actually supervise the study of that assignment.
This results in not only better prepared lesson and hence
a better trained child, but also in reduction in that intolerable amount of ‘‘homework’’ which has too often interfered

, with the proper home training and home life of many children.
Then, too, emphasis may now be placed on more home reading
of approved and recommended Enghsh literature, and each

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
child held responsible for the reading of specified number of
books outside of school.

 The program no longer admits of an election of subjects in the seventh grade. The pupil is only gradually introduced to the special features, manners and customs of secondary school organization,  e., departmentalized work; election
of subjects; differentiation of courses, ete.

 After pupil has been in the Junior High School for
a year and has had an opportunity to learn something about
the organization, he may then elect to follow the Foreign ,
Language Course or the General Course. Pupils who elect
the Foreign Language Course may select to study either
French or Latin, but no pupil may study more than one
foreign language in the Junior High School. Pupils who elect
the General Course in the eighth year may choose between
the Commercial Course or the Industrial and Household Arts
Course in the ninth year. It cannot be too often repeated that
in the selection of these courses no pupil can take fatal
step, and that all of the courses lead into the general academic
or special courses of the Senior High School.

|  The amount of time devoted to the study of such
special subjects as shop, music and art, has been very carefully defined and apportioned. The ratio which the time
allotment for these subjects bears to the amount of time spent 
on the fundaments is that of one to four. In other words,
eighty per cent of the time schedule is occupied with the
studies of English, Mathematics and the social sciences, and
twenty per cent with special subjects. Surely it cannot be
charged that in this city at least, special subjects have
usurped the place of more important subject matter in the
Junior High School curriculum.

 Provision has been made so that the pupils may meet
once week in the auditorium as school, during what is
known as the assembly period. At this time not only are
general matters relating to the conduct of the school dis‘

‘cussed, but subjects of current interest are dramatized by the

pupils. Thus in the Highland School some of the projects

worked out this fall were: The Plymouth Centenary; Good

English Week; Limitation of Arms Conference and Good

Citizenship. Under this arrangement, every boy and girl has

a chance to appear before an audience at least once during
‘the year, to discover and express his latent powers.

 Promotion is made on the basis of proficiency in the

| individual subjects. School programs have been arranged so

that pupils showing special ability in any subject may take

advanced work in that subject, and conversely pupils failing

in certain subjects need repeat only the work in which they

failed. This is called ‘‘promotion by subject,’’ and is de‘signed to provide for the upper third as well as the lower

third of Junior High School pupils.

 In order to safeguard thoroughly the supervision of
the many Junior High School activities, the principals have
been relieved of most of their teaching duties. Then, too,
under plan of monthly departmental meetings between the
Senior and Junior High School teachers, the work of both schools is becoming closely coordinated.

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

EVENING HIGH SCHOOL REORGANIZATION.

Another readjustment of the year, which merits more
than passing mention, was the reorganization of the Evening.
High School on basis of three sessions week rather than
four. The considerations which prompted this change are
the following:

While the enrollment and even the membership of the
Evening High School for several years has been satisfactory,.

. the rate of attendance has not been in keeping with it. Nor
oo, is this to be wondered at. There is no lack of evidence of the
earnestness of the young men and women of the city, of their

eagerness to advance and of their zeal to embrace proper
educational opportunities. But it is almost too much to ask.

- them, after their tiring tasks in the stores, offices and shops,,.

to attend Evening High School four evenings every week..

Hence, while many were willing to come two or three evenings,
very few, indeed, were consistently present at the four sessions each week.

Before making the change, the experience of the State
was consulted. questionnaire on the matter was sent to the
superintendent of schools in every city in Massachusetts where
there is an evening high school. Out of the twenty-eight
cities replying, five cities maintain an evening high school
four evenings week; twenty-two cities three evenings a
week; and one city two evenings week. It is also interesting to note that in only two cities is the evening high school
open on Friday night, the session that was discontinued in
this city.

Another phase of the question was that of the teacher
supply. Holyoke must recruit nearly all of its evening school
teaching force from among the regular day school teachers.
Very few others are available. Many teachers dislike very
much to assume the burden of evening school work, after an
arduous day in the classroom—nor from an administrative

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
standpomt is it altogether desirable that they should. However, with one less evening session, more trained teachers are
available for this kind of work: ,

As far as practical results are concerned, the change has
meant considerable saving of money to the city. The attendance at the Evening High School this fall was considerably better than during corresponding period last year,
while both the teachers and principal claim that fully as much
subject matter is being covered as under the old program.

AMERICANIZATION. )

The Americanization program was carried forward with
the same energy and with the same measure of success that
has characterized the movement in this city ever since the
beginning of the intensive campaign jn  The year’s ac- 
tivities were further marked by two outstanding events: )
Holyoke’s ‘‘Concert of the Nations’’ in the City Hall Auditorium, February and the closing Americanization assembly in the High School Auditorium, April .

‘‘The Concert of the Nations’’ was project conducted
under the auspices of the local Chamber of Commerce, which
the representatives of ten nationalities engaged in; singing
their own songs, playing on their own musical instruments,
and otherwise vitalizing the tremendous contributions which
they are making to the civilization of America. This affair,

| moreover, served to illustrate the close co-operative relations
which exist between the School Department and local civie
organizations in advancing this work. 

The closing Americanization assembly in the High School
Auditorium was an impressive meeting. On that occasion
one hundred and seventy-four aliens, representing twenty different nationalities, received Federal diplomas and State certificates for completion of courses in Citizenship and English.
The affair was made memorable, too, by the presence of His
Excellency, Governor Channing H. Cox of Massachusetts, who

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

e
delivered the principal address of the evening. Governor Cox
not only lent dignity and inspiration to the gathering, but by
his presence emphasized the importance which State and National Governments attach to this kind of work.

Holyoke is very proud of the record which it has made
in the field of Americanization, and this department is preparing for an even more intensive and fruitful season.

. SCHOOL PUBLICITY.
The past twenty-five years have seen many notable advances in the field of educational science. Education and
educational processes have undergone thorough revision in
order to meet the heavy demands which the complexity of
modern society is naking on them. The supremaey of the organization and the traditional academic training of the “‘little |
red schoolhouse’’ have been sharply challenged. Not that the
three ‘‘R’s’’ have been abandoned, as some contend, but it is
- now recognized that there are many other things also, such as
character building, citizenship, physical well being, ete., entirely vital in the training of the child. Moreover not all
pupils will respond to the same kind of educational treatment.
There must be varied curricula, special courses, etc., to meet
the needs of different capacities and different groups.
, The aim of education, too, has been restated as being a
training for life and its many activities rather than mere
storing up of knowledge. This means that the schools must
train for leisure as well as for work; that we must take into
account the fidustrial, the social and even the domestic life
of the individuals and of the community as well.

Hence we have the Junior High School with its emphasis |
upon occupational studies; the Vocational School; the part- |
time Continuation School; the highly differentiated courses of
the Senior High School; the introduction of life situations
into our classrooms, and the utilization of purposing and purposeful activities in the teaching process. Much of this

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  progressive awakening has been due to the sound philosophy

and the excellent leadership of such men as Dr. John Dewey,
Dr. William H. Kilpatrick, Thorndike, Kingsley, Merriam, |
Coursault and others. ‘‘The schools of today are better than
the schools of yesterday because of greater professional training, of better morale, more effective administrative machinery,
more knowledge.of the need of the child, perfected methodology of teaching, and better realization of the social and industrial environment of the child in the classroom and of the 
eitizen in life.’’

Most of these great changes have been introduced in loeal school systems, however, without the understanding or
even the knowledge of busy public. They are different from

the methods and courses that prevailed when the men and
women of today went to school. Hence there has been disposition to look at them askance. Many progressive move’ ments have been scored as fads and frills, simply because they

have never been fully presented to the community.

The schools are totally dependent upon the sympathy and
support of taxpaying public. The public on the other hand
ought to be advised of the scientific functioning of the schools.

It was with this thought in mind that school publicity campaign was inaugurated in this city during the year. The

local press has aided us materially in the project, granting us ,

space for popularly written articles on such subjects as ‘‘Our

Junior High School Organization’’; ‘‘Socialized Recitations’’ ;

“Our Physical Education Program’’; ‘‘Our New Kindergarten Plan’’; ‘‘ Americanization’’; and ‘‘ Boys’ and Girls’ Club
; Work.’’ The people of the city seemed highly pleased to

learn of these interesting activities. This publicity work must

go on until the proposition of bigger, better and more efficient schools is sold to every citizen.

Respectfully submitted,
WILLIAM R. PECK.

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

I append herewith the report of the Assistant Superintendent, Miss Jennie E. Scolley: /
SUPERVISION.

The work of supervision in the schools includes constant study of children and schools in order to understand
conditions, capacities, and educational needs. It means the
establishing of unity of effort throughout the schools, and the

providing of situations where teachers can realize the fullest
freedom to use their own initiative. Encouragement, guidance and assistance is extended in the solving of many of the
school problems, all with this purpose in view—that supervisor and teachers may each do their best in contented cooperative working corps.

I, therefore, wish to report that during the past year,
through this hearty co-operation, progress has been made in
every branch of our work. Modern educational methods and
practices prevail throughout the school system. Special attention has been given spelling, geography and oral English
with satisfactory results. Too much praise cannot be given

- the teaching force for excellent results obtained in the many
phases of classroom instruction; project work, supervised
study, socialized recitation and interpretive reading.

TIE PROJECT METHOD.
 It is conceded that whole-hearted purposeful activity in @
social situation, as unit of school procedure, is the best
guarantee of the utilization of the child’s native capacities
too frequently wasted. The Project Method, so much discussed, uses purposeful acts in the educative process.

The purpose of the school is to enable the child to become
a vital, constructive factor in democratic society. The development of the child implies that he must have the necessary knowledge and skill to make him economically independent, and that he must also be possessed of dynamic social

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

| qualities which enable him to fill his place effectively in the

Commonwealth. In the past we emphasized the first part of

this aim, but in many ways neglected the last part—the social
factor. "

To accomplish the present aim in education three factors
must be considered, namely: the child, the child’s present so’ cial, industrial and commercial surroundings, and the course
of study followed in teaching the child.

The Project Method, now followed in the best schools,.
gives the child, through genuine whole-hearted motivation,
the required knowledge and skill in the essential subjects. It
also aims to give the necessary training in all the qualities
that make for full life and the best kind of citizen. Among
these qualities are initiative, resourcefulness, organization,
sustained effort, originality, leadership, fellowship and positive character.

Throughout the grades this method of teaching has been
introduced with worthy results. Both individual and group:
projects have been successfully carried on during the year.
Much of the child’s work consists of group projects. This
develops individual responsibility to the group—the basis of
good citizenship. But whether they are group or individual
projects, they are all educative, since they possess real motives, stimulate honest effort, require individual or group responsibility, and an estimate of values. It all aims to give
the boys and girls the education demanded by the modern
conditions today and of the world they will live in as men
and women.

Especially fine results were obtained in geography and
history. Project work of unusually high standard was accomplished in the Highland, Elm Street, South Chestnut Street
and the William Whiting schools last year. Some of the work
from these buildings was sent to Hyannis Summer School by
request, and received much praise.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
THE KINDERGARTEN.

Last year change was made in our kindergarten policy
and program, and year was spent in study and experimentation. With some modifications the kindergarten plan of
last year has been accepted. Our aims in the reorganization
of the kindergarten were to establish the kindergarten along
modern ideas in method and equipment; to establish closer
co-ordination between the kindergarten and first rade to afford opportunities for some reorganization of the first grade;
to emphasize the training of children in initiative, invention
and responsibility.

The value of the kindergarten has been amply demonstrated. As an organic part of the school as whole, however,

| its value is being appreciably increased with our new plan of  
organization, the modern methods used, and the new equipment introduced.

Modern educational theory is bringing changes in methods and materials of both kindergarten and first grade. Some .
of these changes are the replacing of limited number of
small blocks in boxes by large material in bulk. The use of
eloth, wood and other industrial material is replacing sewing
cards, paper weaving, ete. Free choice of materials on the
part of the child and invention in carrying out his play purposes characterizes the new type of kindergarten work. An
increasing emphasis is being placed on activities in which
children exercise their own initiative instead of having the
work of all periods prescribed by the teacher. )

During the period of childhood it is the craving for activities that provide the muscular system with plenty of exercise. The large fundamental muscles are the ones that crave
this exercise. The fine accessory muscles have not developed
enough to need exercise. The knowledge of these facts caused
some of the changes in the kindergarten. The materials used
have been enlarged as the large block—Patty Smith Hill

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
blocks—for building on the floor. These provide the exercising of the muscles of the back, hips and arms, as well as providing opportunities for various forms of activity that satisfy
some one or more impulses of the child. Swings, seesaws,
slides and sand piles are fuund in the modern kindergarten.
‘The new plan implies some reorganization of the work of |
the first grade. ‘‘The present-day conception is that the period from four to eight years in child's life is psychologi- .
-eally one period, and that the methods of both kindergarten ,
and first grade should possess the same characteristics. Where |
this conception is carried out there is no break between the
kindergarten and first grade.’’ In our first grade definite
basal work in reading, writing, oral English, ete., is carried
-on. We also advise advanced activities along the project idea
 which encourages freedom, initiative and invention. Storytelling, dramatization and rhythmic games form part of the
-day’s program. Therefore, the large floor space and equipment of the kindergarten, as well as specially trained teach-ers, afford opportunity to do this linking of the first grade and |
kindergarten most happily. ,
The following plan is now in operation:
First FivE MontTHs OF YEAR. |
)  Regular kindergarten work for children four years
-old and over along approved lines every morning. The morning session is from to  .
 Every afternoon for four afternoons, groups from
the first grades go at regular periods to the kindergarten.
Special advaneed work as outlined in the course of study is
earried on. This work includes conversational lessons, story‘telling, dramatization, folk dancing and rhythmic games, also
the free choice of work which develops self-reliance and responsibility.
 Friday afternoon is set apart for kindergartners to
-attend conferences and for home visits and mothers’ meetings.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
Last Five MoNTHS OF YEAR.

 Regular kindergarten work every morning for kindergarten children as carried on the first part of the year. 
The first grade children do not have the kindergarten periods
now.

.  The older kindergarten children, those physically
able and whose parents approve, will attend short afternoon
sessions for advanced work along the new methods. This
work leads to desire for reading. During these short afternoon sessions children are given the ‘‘next steps’’ in the development of language control. These afternoon sessions are
held Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. )

 Friday afternoons will be for home visits, mothers’
meetings and teachers’ conferences.

SPECIAL CLASSES.

Most school systems provide classes for particular groups
of children who need special training that cannot be given
them in regular grade classes. The School Department have
organized two special classes for two different types of children.

The atypical class housed in the Elm Street School re‘eeives children from the different parts of the city. Here
children receive the training to meet their particular needs.
Most satisfactory results have been achieved during the past

. few years.

Frequent inquiries regarding this school are received
from school superintendents and leaders in the training of
the mentally defective child.

Professor Hayes and Professor Townsend, heads of the
Departments of Edueation at Mount Holyoke and Smith Colleges, respectively, have brought groups of students at various times to observe the work.

. Records are faithfully kept concerning the progress of
each pupil and of his physical condition while in school. His

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
occupation, residence, and the measure of his success in afterlife are matters of record.

: ‘Miss Herbert, the teacher of this class, visits the various
schools in the afternoons to examine particular pupils. She :
has been most successful in gaining the co-operation of the
parents of her children in carrying out her plans.

We regret that the lack of room does not permit us to
open another atypical class, as we have eighteen more pupils
who need this kind of training.

The following is summary of statistics of this school:

The school opened in  .

| Present number in class,  .

Chronological age—  years to years. —

Mental age—  years to years.

Number of graduates from school,  .

Returned to regular grades,  .

Returned to parochial school,  .

At home,  |

Deceased,  |

Sent to institutions,  to Waverly, to Clark

School, to other institutions).

The other special class is of another type and was opened
last October at the Hamilton Street School. This auxiliary
class is for over-age, non-English speaking pupils. Special
training is given these pupils to fit them for regular grade
work without much loss of time and without interfering with
the progress of the regular class group.

Miss Elizabeth Burke was placed in charge and the
results prove that more classes of this tvpe are needed in
certain sections of the city.

AMERICANIZATION.

Americanization education must be conceived and carried
out in the true American spirit. We know that to be the
spirit of fair play, of equality, and of justice, ‘‘The spirit

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
that grants all citizens an open way to deserve and receive in
common the fullest human brotherhood in things of mind and
heart.’’

Americanization is as broad as life itself. ‘‘It is the
weaving into the warp and woof of the life of the community,
those who come to make it their home.’’ In such assimilation,
education in English is, of courses, the first step.

Edueation is public responsibility and publie funetion, therefore Americanization, community project, is under the central authority of the School Board, with state supervision.

We have definite plan of work, carefully outlined in
detail. The generous co-operation of different associations and
the managements of the various industries have made it posstble to develop the standard of work which has received the
approbation of the state authorities.

We are much pleased at the growth of this work and
desire to increase it still more. We believe that the Superintendent of Schools should have the hearty support of the
community in his desire to educate the illiterate adults of
our city.

This work is carried on through the evening schools,
neighborhood classes, mothers’ classes, special classes, and the
industrial classes held in the various plants.

The Assistant Superintendent of Schools is the Director
of Americanization and is ably assisted by Miss Anna Warren,
who gives full time to this task, in teaching and supervising.
We have twenty-seven part-time teachers engaged in this work.

PART IV.
REPORT OF PRINCIPAL OF THE
HIGH SCHOOL.
To the Superintendent of Schools:

The criticism often made, and justly so, that public buildings are in actual use but small amount of the time, and so
return but part of the benefits for which they are erected,
is far from true in the case of our High School and Gymnasium buildings. During the school year of  the High —
School building housed the High School pupils in the regular
session from to  and in special sessions, often from
the close of school until in the afternoon. The new law
creating continuation schools made it necessary to use several
rooms in the High School four hours each school day, from
  to o’clock.

The Evening High School, the Evening Vocational School
and University Extension classes occupy most of the rooms
in the building from to  This, with the lectures and
other entertainments under the auspices of the High School
on many Friday nights of the school year, gives well-filled
building large proportion of the evenings of the school year.
In the gymnasium much the same condition exists, the High
School pupils using both the large and small gymnasiums and
the swimming pool practically every hour of the regular High
School session. In the afternoon, the High School pupils
again on many days use the entire gymnasium plant for team
practice, games and social gatherings, and in the evening,

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
on certain scheduled dates the large gymnasium is used for
regular scheduled basketball games and the pool for swimming meets. Several other schools use the gymnasium in the
evening, and the.Vocational School has evening regular hours
for both the swimming pool and the large gymnasium.

All this means that the upkeep and repair of the buildings to be used to their best advantage should be regularly attended to, and damages done owing to the natural wear and
tear should be anticipated. The floors of the gymnasium need
attention now, or they will be in unusable condition in few 
years. The expense would be comparatively small rather than
having the work done by replacements. In the High School
building, good start was made last summer by resurfacing
and varnishing practically all of the desks in the class and
section rooms. This should now be followed up by the repairing of both the outer and inner walls of the building; the first
to prevent the leakage caused by rain storms, and the second
to make the interior more attractive and usable.

One change made necessary by the placing of all of the
Continuation pupils in the High School building was in the
schedule of High School hours. The class session now begins |
at and closes at  This allows. the Continuation
School, which has also changed its schedule of hours, little
conflict with the High School schedule; the hours of the Continuation School being from one to five o’clock P. M.

The High School pupils are, however, required to remain
until  except those pupils who are doing satisfactory
work. This gives an opportunity for the teacher to meet from
  to daily, small groups of pupils who need special assistance. The teachers have, as usual, regular afternoon
consultation period on certain days from to  Now
that the session of classroom work is shorter it is also possible
to do extra laboratory work with pupils in the sciences from
  to on certain afternoons. The Chemistry classes
have special assignments, and are covering in more Satis/

factory way the laboratory requirements than they have beeu
able to do in the past recent years.

In changing the time of school hours devoted to recitation periods from to  loss in class periods of twenty minutes occurred. An even division of time, deducting the recess period, would give each of the six class
periods about minutes. This does not take into consideration the time required for passing of pupils between periods.
This passing takes about four minutes. plan was inaug- .

-urated in September providing for lengthening some periods
and shortening others on certain days of the week. On Monday, the first and second periods are lengthened to about  
minutes; on Tuesday, the third and fourth periods, and on
Thursday, the fifth and sixth periods. On Wednesday and
Friday, when auditorium exercises are held, the time for
elass periods is equally distributed throughout the six periods.

The long period gives an opportunity at least once week
for the teacher to give part of the period to Supervised Study |
in the lessons of the following days. It gives also an opportunity for work of nature needing more consecutive time.
In the Physical Training and Domestic Science work, and in
the Sciences, the long period, of course, has many advantages.
This change in class hours has minimized the disadvantages
of the shorter school program.

The class work in many of the subjects is being made more

and more pupil participation than solely teacher instruction.
In the Modern Languages, each class elects secretary, who
reads the report of the previous recitation in the language
that the class is studying. This report is made up in conference with the teacher, and reviews the work of the preceding
day. It also contains lesson assignments and names of absentees. After this is read, the secretary asks certain number of questions previously covered. This is not only good
for the pupil making out the questions, but assists the other
pupils on the essential points of the review work. The trans  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
lation work is reduced to minimum, giving the pupils every
opportunity for oral self-expression. The common method of
asking questions is in the foreign languages based on the pre pared text. Here the teacher, by wise choice of questions,
stimulates thought in the drill on points of grammar in the
text as well as building up vocabulary out of the lesson.
Passages are also assigned for memorizing, and recited. When
a play is being read memorizing is frequently required, pupils

 taking the part of characters. Dictation often forms part
of the reading lesson, and is one of the most valuable exercises
for training the ear. In each recitation, the teacher is to keep
in mind the fact that the lesson js large one in training the
ear, the eye and the tongue, and makes the exercises conform
to this end. All of this with other somewhat similar methods
gives the recitation more socialized aspect, keeps the pupils
alert and interested, and makes the language seem real and
practical.

| In the English Department, classification of pupils in
different sections of the same subject has been made on the
basis of the ability of the pupils. The tendency, perhaps,
has been exaggerated in giving too much attention to the average student or the poorer student, and to leave the brilliant
boy or girl to take care of himself. Placing the best pupils
together prevents this retarding, and also benefits the slower
pupil by allowing the teacher to grade the pupil in accordance
with the pupil’s powers. The use of the socialized recitation
has been extended in the English Department. Although a
method is only means to an end, and no one method can be
used for all occasions, it has been found that the socialized
recitation allows the pupil more opportunity for the development of his individuality, keeps him more alert during the
class period and teaches him more effectively his responsibilities. To develop still further the ideal of citizenship, all
elasses in English take one day week for the discussion of
publie questions. This is not only true in English, but is also

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
emphasized in the Department of History and Industrial
Geography. Nearly every pupil in the school purchases at his
own expense periodical of good standing from which he
prepares an oral composition on something of national interest. This gives the boys and girls the power to digest what
has been read; to learn intelligently many of the important
events of current history; and to talk fairly well about these

| events before their classmates.

In the English Department and other departments as
well, frequent meeting of the Heads of the Departments
with the teachers of the High School and the Junior High
School has brought about close correlation and good understanding of the work done in each school. If develops a
uniformity where it is needed, but allows of individual teach- ing and takes into consideration the personality of the teacher.
All of the departments in the school act in harmony with the
English Department in the encouraging of good English.

At our recent observance of ‘‘ Better Sph’’ week, original posters and slogans were handed in by nearly every pupil
in the school. At the beginning of the week Mr. Seth Bush,
head of the office force of the Crocker-McElwain Company,
‘spoke to the school about the use of good English in business.
His talk created very favorable impression, and is bound to
have good results. At the close of the week an original play
was presented before the school in which the use of good and .
bad English was graphically portrayed. This week is permanent function of the school, and its results show much lasting good.

Mathematics, in common with many subjects, is being re‘quired to reduce its course to essentials in elementary sehools.
‘One of the texts that attempts to meet this requirement is
General Mathematics, by Schorling and Reeve. One of our
teachers in the summer of took the instruction course
offered by one of the authors of this book at Harvard, and the

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
course based upon this was tried in one class in the year of
  and is being continued this year.

The objectives of the book are these: ‘‘To give the course
to those who will not extend their study of mathematics some
insight into the fundamental principles of mathematics and
the wide range of applications, also to give those who will go
on general view of the field which is to be entered upon for
more intensive study. It keeps the close connection of Geom;
etry, Arithmetic, Algebra and Trigonometry in mind from the
beginning. In this study the pupils learn to sketch and measure common geometric figures and to state the measurements
in arithmetic and algebraic values.’’ The head of the department gives as reason for the study of General Mathematics
the unifying elements as follows: First, the idea of function;

second, the equation; third, the graph; fourth, the formula.
These are emphasized throughout the course. ‘‘So far,’’ the

’ teacher says, ‘‘the course has justified the hopes placed in it.

A further trial is needed in order to enable full judgment to

be made. The course certainly is in the direction of presentday demands.’’ .

The course in Industrial Geography which has taken the
place of Commercial Geography is being carried along the
lines of Project Work. This encourages the pupils to work
together with common interests and purposes to the end that
they might acquire useful information, good habits, better attitudes, proper ideals and the best methods of work. The
working out of the project has involved many kinds of activities on the part of the pupils. Sometimes the purpose has been

to make something, sometimes to enjoy the experience, sometimes to solve an intellectual problem, and at other times to

-  aequire some degree of knowledge or skill. The Project Work
must necessarily be guided intelligently by the teacher. With| out this it would run riot and result in nothing but Ioose ends.
The teacher must encourage the pupils to make plans to carry

out their purposes, and then must guide them in the executiow

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  "
of these plans. The work itself is to be done largely by the
pupil, although the teacher and the pupil are benefited by
such combination of supervised work and student execution..

One of the projects undertaken with much success was.
that of papermaking. One group of girls in the Industrial
Geography class appeared before the entire school and gave
a demonstration in papermaking. They have learned the
processes of one of Holyoke’s chief industries, and in connec- |
tion with this they have studied the problems of distribution.
connected with the raw product and the finished article..

‘+ Many visits have been made to different manufacturing industries imparting to the work living touch.

In most of the sections of Industrial Geography the class.
is often divided into small groups, who carry on their investigations informally during the class period, each group work- .
ing independently of the others. Home work is assigned by the group leaders in conference with members of the group.

A paper is required from each pupil each day, and the
leader of the group makes daily written report to theinstructor to show the kind of work and amount of work
that is passed in. One day week full report is required
from each group leader. ‘These reports are read aloud beforethe entire class. No better illustration of student participation

In the Bookkeeping classes each pupil is encouraged to
work out project each week as part of the home work..
These projects take the nature of practical business problems.
which aim to test the power of the pupil to apply what he has
learned in the classroom and from outside observation to the:
solution of definite problems. In all bookkeeping classes em-.
phasis is being placed upon the effect of each transaction upon
the business rather than on the record necessary to show the
effect. This aims in socializing the recitation.

"  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

In the Office Appliance and Office Practice classes there
are many opportunities to apply special projects. Much of
this work is very practical, and is often concerned with the
assisting of various teachers in the school in work in their departments, such as stencil cutting, mimeographing, taking dictation, making carbons, etc. This results in co-operation with
every department in the school and builds up solidarity
‘beneficial both to the teachers and the pupils. Babson’s
weekly letter and reports are used in the advanced classes,
pupils being required to make investigations upon local industrial conditions. Of course, in the Commercial Depart- |
ment, many of the pupils are engaged in work outside of
school hours in stores and offices in the city, and practical illustrations of business practice and methods are suggested by

| such pupils in discussion in the classrooms.

The Disarmament Conference in Washington comes in
for serious study by all of the pupils in the school, as the
‘pupils both in English and History have been encouraged and
required by their teachers to give reports from time to time
on the deliberation of this conference. In many of the classes
‘scrap books containing clippings from magazines and newspapers and articles pertaining to the conference are being
made. These will be filed later in the library, and may be
used as reference books in looking up facts concerning this
‘convention.  

We try to place the emphasis upon the growth of the pupils rather than upon the teaching of the subject. If the for‘mer is emphasized the latter will to large extent take care of
itself. An inspection of the classroom work of the school, I
‘believe, will show that our methods are producing good results
where the pupil participates voluntarily in the work of the
classroom, and where the spirit of instruction is co-operative
both pupil and teacher are benefited.

Our graduating class in June numbered  In this

The First Honor list is as follows: Magnis Greenman,.

The reports of the colleges show that our pupils are doing satisfactory work. With some few exceptions all of our
pupils who were candidates for the College Board examinations in June were successful. While comparatively small
number of our pupils took these examinations, the test is a
rather rigid one and shows that the school is meeting the
standard set for it by higher authorities.

Honor lists containing the names of seniors who have
maintained an average rank of per cent or higher, are announced each year, some time during the second semester.
This list is printed in the commencement program, awards
given in keeping with the honors at graduation, and reference
made to it in the annual report.

Pupils who leave school before graduation or who have
maintained honor ranks for certain series of years receive
no recognition. This is to be changed, by the publishing of
a list of all High School pupils from time to time who have
received ratings of or higher, in all of their subjects, or who
have this as an average mark. The first of such hsts will be
published soon after January Ist,  It should result in
encouraging many pupils who are on the list to remain there

for the next publication, and others who have not received
that standing to strive to maintain it.

In admitting pupils to the Senior High School it is ssary often to give admission to pupils who have not com‘pleted all of the subjects of the Junior High School, but as
the Senior High School is able to take care of such pupils in
the matter of room, believe it is better to continue to admit
them. Some pupils who enter without condition find difficulty
in certain lines of work, and also find it almost impossible to
-earry successfully all of the subjects required. The best solution of this difficulty, in my mind, would be to offer both a
three and four-year course in the Senior High School, admitting and continuing in the three-year course all pupils who
wish to take the full number of hours and are able to do satisfactory work in all of the subjects required, admitting to
‘the four-year course such pupils who may prefer an extended
time of study and wish to take extra subjects not in the regular prescribed courses, or pupils who are conditioned in certain subjects. This would give the pupil more of an opportunity to do regular High School work with definite classification and would graduate the pupil not later in life than
was formerly done when the High School had only fouryear course. think this elasticity of arrangement would
encourage many pupils to remain in the school who might
otherwise drop out through failure to carry full program.

The showing of motion pictures has been differently arranged this year. committee was appointed on which there
were teachers from different departments of the school. The
programs prepared by this committee are given every other
week on Friday morning, one of the school periods being
omitted on that day, the period differing on each successive

left largely to the committee, but teachers in other departments mav suggest from time to time reels that they would
like to have shown. Pictures in relation to History. Literature,

I have in this report intentionally omitted certain data
that in the past has usually been included in the Principal’s
report. Most of this is found among statistical data usually
given by the Superintendent of Schools.

In these days there are many and various phases of High
School work, and it is difficult in one report to make any
complete statement concerning all of them. It is my hope,
however, that this report may be, in so far as it goes, of some

. value in giving to the School Department and the citizens of
Holyoke better understanding of the work done in the past
year in the High School.

HOWARD CONANT,
Principal.

This section of the volume is devoted to the reports of the
Principal of the Evening High School, and of the Director of
the Continuation School. In addition, there may be found excerpts embodying essential features contained in the statements of the supervisors of special work, submitted annually

, in December to the Superintendent.

Report of the Principal of the Evening High School:

“The year just finished has been particularly interesting because it
afforded an opportunity to make comparisons of the work of the school .
under the old and new program. During the period from January to the
close of the term in March, the weekly program called for eight periods.
of one hour each. School was in session on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday evenings. This program had been in operation almost
since the school was organized. While it enabled us to cover considerable
ground, nevertheless the attendance was invariably light on Friday evening. Practically of the student body was absent on Friday evenings,
and as result much time was lost on the following Monday evening in
reviewing work for the benefit of the absentees.

“During the summer vacation the superintendent made survey of
the State with reference to weekly sessions of Evening High Schools,
and it was found that Holyoke, with perhaps one or two exceptions, was
the only city in the State holding four sessions per week. Subsequently
the principal and superintendent conferred as to the advisability of a
change. The question was considered from every point of view. and as
a result the Friday night session was eliminated. It may be too early
yet to make fair comparison, but it is certain that the percentage of attendance of pupils during the first month was higher than at any time

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
- since the school was organized. This is very encouraging, for public
evening schools invariably suffer from irregular attendance.

“From my observation of the work of the classes, and from the reports of the faculty, am led to believe that we shall be able to accomplish substantially the same amount of work as we did under the old
program, except perhaps in the classes in Manual Training and Mechanical Drawing. which latter were able to conduct two classes of two nights
each under the old program, but have been obliged to rearrange their
schedules this year which compel their classes to alternate, one class meeting one night one week and two nights the following week. This arrangement, however, will work out satisfactorily, for, as the term advances, we shall probably be able to make combinations if the membership of the classes is reduced.

“The general appearance of the whole student body this year is
most satisfactory, the pupils as whole seem older than for the past few
years.

“The Science classes this year are larger than ever before, while the .
Physics class is smaller. This latter class is handicapped by being
obliged to meet in room which is not particularly well fitted for a
Physics Laboratory. coursé presenting as many technical and mathematical difficulties ought to be given every assistance possible.

, “The class in Chemistry conducted for the benefit of the Holyoke
City Hospital nurses, is primarily elementary in nature, but has been of
considerable benefit to the young women in attendance. The course is
designed with view to give the pupils knowledge concerning all the
important chemical elements and compounds and specially the important
part which chemistry plays in the medical world. When chemistry and
bacteriology overlap, short talks and explanations are given as, for instance, in the study of water purification and the kinds and uses of disinfectants and germicides.

“The Commercial Department, as in past years, is one of the most
important departments in the school. The course this year has been enlarged, and class in Advanced Stenography as well as one in Office
Appliances are being conducted. The class in Advanced Stenography was
organized to meet the demand for more rapid dictation than can be given
in Stenography Two. ‘The work covers dictation of simple matter, average matter and difficult matter at varying rates of speed. This work
affords an excellent opportunity to students who wish to keep up their
speed while unemployed, or to increase it where more speed seems essential. The present equipment in Office Appliance work is somewhat limited as to number, but there is good variety; Burroughs Calculating,
Monroe Calculating machines, Burroughs Adding and Listing machines,

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

Dictaphone and Ediphone Dictating machines, and Mimeograph and Letter Press machines are now being used. Our time is devoted to fundamentals with more advanced work in invoicing, discounting and figuring
of interest. Cutting of stencils and their application to the mimeograph
is also taken up, and dictating machines at the option of the students.
This course has proved very popular during the year.

“We have an excellent class in Mechanical Drawing, but the lighting arrangement of the room is very poor and should be remedied at
once. Requisitions have been placed for some text books for this course,
and these will help the pupils materially.

, “Classes in Freehand Drawing, English Literature, Spanish and
: French have had rather light attendance, but are doing excellent work,
and the pupils who do attend are so earnest in their efforts and faithful

in attendance that the courses were continued. :

“The classes in Algebra and Geometry have been well attended and
are doing splendid work. Some of the students intend to enter college
or technical schools, while others find the instruction of practical value in
their present work.

“Interest in the Cooking classes apparently grows stronger each
year. We enrolled pupils in these classes this year. In order to accommodate as many as possible four classes were formed, each class hav- .
ing membership of  and waiting list was established for those who
could not be placed in cooking classes conducted in other school buildings
of the city. About one-third of the pupils are young women who have
recently married, the balance are made up for the most part of young
women engaged to be married, domestics and clerks. The course is intensely practical and covers the whole subject of general cooking, table
setting and serving. .

“The greatest need in the school at the present time is complete rearrangement of the lighting system. have made this statement with
monotonous regularity for so many years that my memory ‘runneth not
back to the contrary.’ realize, of course, that the school department is
helpless in this respect, but feel it my duty to register the crying needs
of the building because they are matters which vitally effect the welfare
of the pupils.

“All classes, with the exception of Cooking and Manual Training,
have been recognized by the State Board of Education to the extent of
making them co-operative extension courses, and pupils in these classes
who have completed the required amount of work at the end of the term
will be given certificates by the State, crediting them with the amount of
work which they have accomplished.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

“The Americanization courses which were so successful in past years
have been continued this year under somewhat different program.
There are two classes in English for foreigners, graded elementary and
advanced. ‘These classes meet one evening week. There is class in
Citizenship which meets two evenings week. This latter class has always been popular, and we have tried to give the pupils in this class the
benefit of little special work connected with the court procedure in

. Naturalization, the object being to make the applicant for citizenship familiar with the Naturalization Court, and with this end in view, through
the generous co-operation of the court officials, we were enabled to hold
a moot court last February. The duties of the various courts were outlined, and the petitioners were subjected to examination similar to that
conducted by the Federal examiners. ‘The Court’ was very successful,
and resulted not only in great benefit to the men, but expedited the work
of the officials of the Naturalization Court which was held few days
after. The Justice of the Court and the Clerk of Courts personally assured me that their work was made-much easier in Holyoke because of
the special instruction given the men, and also received letter from
the Chief Federal Examiner, in which he warmly commended the idea,
and made very flattering references to the Citizenship classes which are
conducted here.

“I desire to register my approval of the splendid janitor service
which we have had since the opening of the fall term. These men have
been very faithful in the performance of their duties and are constantly
‘on the job.’” )

Report of the Director of the Continuation School :

“The Holyoke Continuation School has been in operation since September,  The object of the school is to reach the needs of children
between the ages of fourteen and sixteen years of age, who have left
school and gone to work. .

“Most of the pupils attending Continuation School have gone to
work, not because of economic necessity, but because of lack of interest in the regular school. Therefore, the duty of the teachers  to
find out the individual needs of the pupil through his present conditions.

“As the type of pupil is motor-minded, it is through vocational channels that his interest must be aroused, in order that his academic work
may be beneficial to him. The work in the ‘shop’ which is concrete and
of vital interest to him is carried over into the classroom. The daily
family life and home conditions; the factory; loyalty and fair return in
labor to his employer; obedience and respect to parents and those with

. ]

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
whom he is associated; respect and obedience for law and order also
serve as material to enable him to improve himself.

“Since no text book is used in class, and the aim is to reach the individual pupil; to make the lesson of value to the pupil, the teacher must
have carefully planned lesson sheets, and must use the individual rather
than the group method of teaching.

“When the school was started the question to be decided was how to
reach the pupil. As the girls were to be future homemakers, their problem was more easily solved than the boys. It was decided as an experiment to give the girls sewing for ‘shop work.’ The work in the shop
was correlated with the academic work in arithmetic and English, the
material for civics and hygiene was taken from conditions existing in
the factory, the home and community.
 “The pupils in the sewing class bring their own material and have
been taught to make undergarments, aprons, dresses, etc., for themselves.
The girls are also encouraged to sew not only for themselves, but for
their little brothers'and sisters. No objection is made if the pupil wishes
to crochet an edging upon garment or to do little fancy work in the
interim which sometimes occurs, when the pupil must wait for the teacher
to inspect work or give new directions. It is better to be busy and contented than to be idle and in mischief.

“The classes in Cookery are so conducted and planned that before
the year has been completed all the pupils will have had actual work
in preparing and cooking such foods as are familiarly used in the home,
so that, if necessary, the pupil may cook the family meal, as one of our
pupils has done, and not depend upon the delicatessen store or upon
canned goods.

“The other course is combination of home nursing and child welfare. In this course the pupils are taught how to meet the nursing problems, which many of them must encounter in the home, in an intelligent
manner. ‘They are taught how to bandage, make beds for the sick, to
take temperatures, to take proper and ordinary precautions when in the
sick room, sterilization, etc. In the child welfare course the pupils are
taught how to care for young children and infants.

“In the Wood-working course the boy is offered the opportunity to
develop along wood-working lines, not for vocational purposes, but to |
awaken an interest, so that his plans and desires may be discovered and
some effort made to guide him for future life job.

“The Home Repair class has been established with the idea of giving
the boy knowledge of how to do in an intelligent manner the various
repairs and odd jobs that are necessary, but which do not require the aid
of mechanic. He also learns how to act in emergencies. !

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

“In considering the pupil, the school has not devoted all of its time
and energy to the shop, because the academic side of his training has been
carried on with the thoroughness for his present needs and future development.

“For those pupils who have office work or whose scholarship permits, commercial subjects are offered in elementary bookkeeping, commercial arithmetic, civics, English and typewriting.

“The academic department endeavors to bring out the self-confidence
of the pupil; to urge him to continue his education in the evening schools;
tc earn his own living; to make better citizen of him; to bring out his
latent ability, and to help him through vocational guidance wherever
possible. ,

“An important factor which must not be forgotten is the service
rendered to the pupil outside of class and shop. This service is accomplished through follow-up work, and through social activities offered
to the pupils.

“The teacher aims in the follow-up work to become acquainted with
the family of the boy or girl, and through the family and the boy and
girl help wherever possible, to guide the pupil along channels which will
prove most advantageous to him.

“The pupils also have been reached through social activities, such as
swimming classes, entertainments and other social affairs.”

Report of Mr. Robert E. Hamill, Supervisor of the Manual Training Department:

“The phase of manual training which should receive the most consid, eration at present is the High School work. It has been definite policy
followed out for the past few years to emphasize the work in the Junior
High Schools. To satisfactory extent this course has now been established, and except for minor details we are equipped to give type of
work which comes more nearly meeting the needs of our pupils than ever
before. The Senior High School work should now be reconstructed to
meet this changed condition in the preliminary training of the High
School pupils. When the present course of study was outlined only few
High School pupils had had previous shop training. ‘Today, with but few
exceptions, all pupils have had three years of diversified shop experience.
It is question with us as to just how far the present-day technical High
School courses go toward meeting the trained pupils with something that
will carry on, and clinch, the training he has already received. .

“It would appear that we should give definite thought to changes that
would permit the pupil who has reached the stage where he  anxious to

\
  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
work in metal chance to do so. By no means the ‘make-what-youplease’ type of work, but an advanced and comprehensive course involving work in wood, sheet metal, iron and steel, and the construction of experimental electrical apparatus with view later to the introduction of a
course in the principles of gas engine construction and operation.

“In some cities while the worth of such varied course is recognized, its adoption from practical standpoint is hindered by the expensive equipment already installed. Such, for example, was the complete
technical High School equipment of ten or twenty years ago, when it
was necessary part of school course to provide for each pupil complete tool equipment for cabinet-making, pattern-making, foundry and :
machine shop work. Because of the peculiar circumstances in which the
manual training department and the vocational school were involved at
the time the latter was established as separate school, we are not now
confronted with the discarding of any cquipment, except six worthless
speed lathes. We are, in fact, simply going back to the task of straightening out our High School shop courses laid aside for the past few years
because of the greater need of establishing Junior High School courses.

“Among recommendations towards this end we should have separate lumber room, and place to store unfinished work for both day and
evening school work. Also three wood-turning lathes with individual
motors should be added to our machinery equipment. New bench tops
and vises have been bought, and the old ones are now being replaced.
If this program, which is modest, indeed, can be put through during the
coming year, and like program carried out during the next few years.
our High School shop courses can easily be raised to the standard of our
present Junior High School courses.

“Tt is gratifying to report the progress in the work in the Junior
High Schools. ‘The schedule changes put into effect last September have
met with almost unexpected success in developing and unifying shop
work. During the past year, introductory courses in mechanical drawing
have been established, and as rapidly as the equipment can be provided
this work will be extended to all Junior High Schools. Mechanical
drawing is planned as‘a related subject, and for the young workman,  s
never successfully made an end in itself. The muscular control, and the
theoretical projection of thought are not part of the physiological

| equipment of pupils of this age. Hence it is the aim to present only those
rudimentary principles which, once grasped, will permit the pupil to express himself in this new language.

“For some time we have known that majority of Junior High
School pupils have curious interest in various forms of electrical apparatus. Indeed, it would seem to the student of the present-day boy as

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
if the interest of boys in kites, windmills, water wheels and like toys,
generally accepted as typifying his interest in things mechanical, has disappeared in favor of motors, generators, transformers and wireless apparatus. Since manual training properly teaches through those interests
native to the average boy, we are introducing elementary electrical construction in the form of motors, bells, buzzers and telegraph instruments
correlated with the Junior High School science course.”

Report of Miss Teresa L. Dowd, Supervisor of the
Household Arts Department:

 “The work of the Household Arts Department in the Senior and
‘ Junior High Schools is progressing steadily, and has shown decided
advancement during the past year, due to the fact that new rooms have
been provided and new equipment installed. To further enhance this most
useful work, the class periods should be doubled, both in the Junior and
Senior High Schools. ;
“The work in the Senior High School is carried on from Junior
High, each pupil advancing as far as she is capable with new and more
difficult work. This year many pupils have become proficient enough to
make winter coats and suits.

“The Household Arts Department has shown such marked de- |
velopment in sewing and cooking that we should begin to think of expanding. recommend that plans be made for adding regular courses in
millinery, laundry and home nursing to our curriculum, in the near
future.

“The annual exhibition was held at the High School June and  ,
 Many Class Day and Graduation dresses were displayed, as well as
skirts, suits and undergarments, and attracted favorable notice. The
millinery display was exceptionally good. Many hats simulated the work
of finished milliner.”

| Report of Mrs. Isabelle H. Ferry, Supervisor of Drawing:
“Art study is now recognized by leading educators as an important
subject in the school curriculum. There is sometimes misunderstanding

with regard to the reasons for teaching art in the public schools.

“The argmuent is often made that only rarely will one among the
thousands of pupils taught develop into professional artist, and that,
consequently, it is not worth while to take the time of many pupils, for
what will really benefit so few. If it were question only of developing pupils who will be able to paint beautiful pictures, would be the
first to say that it was waste of time, because it is only in exceptional

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

cases that we can hope for any such result; whereas course in Art
F:ducation should be valuable to all the pupils in order to be entitled to a
place in the school curriculum.

“Our modern standards of living demand that everyone shall have
some knowledge of the laws and principles that govern- good taste and
artistic feeling, so that these may be expressed in his home, in his clothing and in his work, whatever it may be. It is the aim of our Art
Course to train pupils so that they will have this knowledge, and such
training is not ‘art for art’s sake,’ but it is ‘art for life’s sake,’ because
it is not only needed, but actually demanded in every feature of modern
life.

“There is no better method known by means of which these principles
can be taught, than through the study of line, form and color, as they
may be applied in the home, in the industries and in community problems.

“Our course in Art has been carefully planned from Grade up,
grading the work according to the pupils’ ability and interests. Below
Grade VI, pupils have two periods week for their combined Manual
Training and Drawing, which are closely correlated, under the direction
of the Art Supervisor. This plan of work has been successfully carried
out for several years, and its results are generally satisfactory. |

“Picture study has been reinstated in our course, after lapse of
several years, with the hope of arousing greater degree of art appreciation and calling more attention to the fine collections of pictures that
many of our school buildings contain.

“The work of the Drawing Department in the Junior High Schools
is In transition state, owing to the difficulties that have been encountered in making many radical changes in these schools.

“More attention should be paid in these grades to the pupil solving
his own problems in an individual way, and the pupil himself should begin to realize the value of careful and accurate workmanship.

“Junior and JI courses in Drawing are now fairly well arranged,
excepting the fact that the regular teachers are still required to do part
of the teaching  some of the schools, but Junior II], where we should
secure our best results, is still working under great difficulties. ‘The
work in this grade being elective, one would naturally suppose that the
pupils electing it would be those having some liking and talent for this
subject, and consequently that they would be able to do quite advanced
work. This will require individual instruction, which can only be given
under favorable conditions. It does seem absolutely necessary that a
special room should be provided for all of the Junior High drawing
where the necessary materials can be kept ready for use. Special rooms,

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
well equipped for their purpose, are provided for Manual Training and
Household Arts in all Junior High Schools in the city, and pupils devote
four periods each week to these studies, while Art, which most of the
leading educators of the country would claim to be of, at least, equal
importance, is hampered by the lack of convenient rooms. lack of pupils’
time—only one period being allowed—and lack of sufficient teaching
force to carry on the work satisfactorily, as the teaching of Art in the
Junior High Schools should be done by special teachers, as is done in
Manual Training and Houschold Arts. earnestly hope that considcration may be given to this matter, and arrangements made for more favorable conditions, as only by this course can we hope to reach the standard

. that should be attained by our Junior High Schools.

“The training that pupils receive in the Jtmior High Schools has
much to do with the results that can be secured in the Senior High
School. If time must be spent there in instilling elementary principles
more advanced work is delayed. Many things are done in the High
School, however, in the line of water color studies, posters for different
occasions, designs for various articles, block nrinting from original
blocks, etc., that the pupils find exdingly interesting. There are large
classes also, composed of pupils who are taking Commercial courses, who
receive instruction in Commercial Design, which includes much practice
in Iettering, show card advertising and kindred matters.

“The School Board and Superintendent have always been generous
to the Art Department in the matter of supplies; the Senior High School
has fine room and equipment. If the Junior High Schools can be as
well provided for, there will be little excuse for failure in securing
satisfactory results.”

Report of Mr. Hugh Craig, Supervisor of Music:

“This year we have begun to replace our old music readers with the
Hollis Dann Series. The change is being made gradually; as the old

books wear out the new ones are bought to take their places. Wherever
the new series has been installed, however, the results are most satisfactory.

“The unsatisfactory conditions mentioned in my last year’s report,
relative to the Junior High School schedule, have been largely remedied
by the reorganized program.

“The graduation exercises of the Junior High were very successful,
the music being well rendered and was highly complimented by those in
attendance. The orchestras are progressing satisfactorily, as was shown
in the several concerts that were given during the year.

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

“At the High School the music of the year has been very profitable
to the pupils, as we have studied music of the best composers. In February the choruses of the school gave their annual concert rendering the
cantata, ‘Joan of Arc,’ by Gaul, assisted by New York soloists. It was
a musical success.”

Report of Mr. Louis K. Appel, Director of Physical Edueation and Hygiene in the grades: |

“In the work of Physical Education and Hygiene there has been no
material change from previous years. The courses of study have been
somewhat enlarged and details in the administration and operation of the
Physical Training and Hygiene program have been perfected.

“In Grade  the course comprises industrial, nature and imaginative
plays. Through imitation of the movements employed in the trades,
and of the different things in nature, the child gains clearer idea of the |
practical world about him. He is given opportunity to express his love.
for enacting characters in fairy tales and drama, and for performing
simple dances. Then. by means of the host of games embodying the
underlying motive of competition, he tests his individual strength, agility
and. self-resourcefulness.

“Physical Training in the kindergartens is linked with that of the
first grade. The child’s spontaneous play is directed into channels showing the rudiments of organization and purpose.

“Physical Training in the second and third grades develops more
completely the play and creative instincts of the child. The industrial,
imaginative and nature piays give unlimited opportunity for expression
and originality. Folk dances are of more complex nature, involving
more poise and co-ordination. Fundamental positions used in the ‘set-up’
exercises are taught. The need for this particular type of work is not
so apparent at this stage of school life, for the child is not confined for
any long periods to his seat.

“In the next three grades, formal gymnastics are stressed in order ;
to secure good posture. The marching exercises, folk dances and competitive games all tend to give the pupil an ‘all-around’ physical development.

“Team plays are introduced at this stage of the school course. By
use of this agency the child learns the lesson that by doing his best, he
also contributes to the ‘common good.’

“In the Junior High School, formal gymnastics are stressed more ;
than ever, for it is necessary to accomplish in short periods of time the

greatest good for the greatest number. At the beginning of the five
recitation periods, short two-minute drill is given the class by pupil

leaders. Apt pupils are trained to take charge of the class in marching
and setting-up exercises designed purposely to counteract poor posture
that might result from long periods of sitting. With the windows wide
open, except in inclement weather, the vigorous exercises involving the
big muscles of the body exert refreshing influence on the pupils.

“Bi-weekly the pupils are taken into the school playgrounds or
auditoriums, which are temporarily transformed into gymnasia. Here
each class is given instruction in marching, setting-up exercises, folk and
national dances and competitive or combative games. .

“The games of the baseball and soccer league reflect the constant
emphasis on ‘good sportsmanship.’ The league finished as follows:

“Baseball: Metcalf; Morgan; Highland; Lawrence; and West.

“Soccer: Morgan; Metcalf; Highland; West; and Lawrence.

“The seventh annual Field Day was held at the Hampden and Prospect playgrounds on June There were approximately  
entrants. The Metcalf School won the Boys’ Meet; the Morgan School
the Girls’ Meet; the Metcalf School won both the boys’ and the girls’ relay
races; and the Elm Street School won both relay races in the primary
schools.

“The efficiency tests, dash, standing broad jump and knec-raising
for the girls, chinning for the boys, are as popular as ever. The results
of this test are as follows:

“Grammar School Boys: Morgan,  Lawrence,  Metcalf, Highland, and West,  .

“Grammar School Girls: Highland, Morgan, Metcalf,
 West Street,  and Lawrence,  .

 “Primary School Boys: Springdale,  South Chestnut Street,
  Hamilton, Elm Street, Kirtland, Ingleside,
 Nonotuck Street,  Whiting,  Sargeant Street,
  and Iklmwood,  .

“Primary School Girls: Ingleside, South Chestnut Street,

“Silver trophies, to be retained one year, were awarded the winners.

“Saturday morning classes at the High School are success, because the Junior High School pupils are not equipped with gymnasia or
pools. Activities that cannot be very well conducted in the schoolroom
or auditorium are stressed.

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

“Many boys are attracted by the pool. Practically all non-swimmers
learn to swim; and to stimulate interest in swimming, meet is held at
the end of the year. The Lawrence School displayed unusual skill, winning both meets, boys’ and girls’.

“Classes in Physical Education for Evening High School boys and
girls were organized. class of thirty ladies were given instruction in
the gymnasium and in the pool by Miss Septa Lynn. Two classes, averaging thirty to thirty-five in each class, were instructed in the gym* nasium by Mr. Davenport, and in the pool by Mr. Francoeur.

“Continuation School boys and girls were extended the privilege of
using the High School Pool.

“Inasmuch as the third year of Junior High School corresponds with
the freshman year of the High School under the older plan, there is no
instruction in Hygiene given in the Senior High School.

“In the Junior High School, despite the fact that programs offer an
obstacle, the Director has found it possible to arrange for lectures to
each Junior IIT class on alternate weeks. The course is the same as that
‘formerly given in the High School. In the limited time allowed for this
branch, the pupil receives the finishing touches to the subject matter
which he has had in the previous years. .

“In Junior and II, and in the primary grades, the classroom teacher
conducts the work, following course of study embracing several text
books, and vitahizing the work by putting into effect health habits.

PUBLIC USk OF HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM

“The popularity of Physical Education is evidenced in the fact that
every vear there is greater demand for the High School gymnasium.
The School Board has extended to the public the privilege of using the
gymnasium. Following is the list of schools and clubs which have
availed themselves of this privilege:

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

“Deducting the refunds, from the total amount received for
rental fees, the actual money received for classes given during
the fiscal year was )

“Deducting the salaries, from the actual money received,
public classes contributed toward maintaining the pool, repairs, supplies,
etc., .

“There is urgent need of vacuum cleaner to remove the sediment
that collects at the bottom of the pool. This would do away with the
practice of brushing the sediment and distributing it throughout the pool,
causing an unnecessary strain on the filters, for the dirt is sucked into
them directly from the strainer. It would improve, beyond question, the
clarification of the water.

“As matter of ‘safety first,’ there should be gas light installed in
the pool, which should be lighted as soon as artificial light is necessary.
Serious consequences might result if the pool were thrown into darkness
by the blowing out of main fuse.

“For the first time since the construction of the pool, the boys and
girls have been privileged to use the natatorium free of charge during the
summer vacation. Hundreds of boys and girls attended daily. Many
children learned to swim, and many imnroved the strokes and dives that
they already knew, as well as learning others. .

“The success of this initial effort of the School Board bespeaks for
the annual use of the pool during the summer months.

“The Massachusetts Humane Society, during the last week of May,
sent Mr. Jack Manning to our pool in order to teach non-swimmers to
swim. Boys and young men attended the lessons daily. Of the one hundred and twenty, fifty-five learned to swim at least the width of the pool,
twenty-four feet. This ‘swimming week’ was such success that a
similar week will be granted to the girls.

“In the building program for the coming year the School Board
should give careful attention to the fact that Physical Education, and its
popularity has emphasized its importance, cannot be carried on without
the fundamental requisite, gymnasium. If possible, every Junior High
School should have well equipped gymnasium and, if possible, swimming pool, for the benefits will more than balance the initial and subsequent costs.”

Report of Mr. John P. Whalen, Director of Physical Edueation, Iligh School Boys:

“Upon entering school each pupil is examined by the school physician. [very pupil, unless excused upon the presentation of medical

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
certificate, is required to report for gymnasium work twice week, one
period each week being devoted to aquatics and the other to gymnasium

: work. The percentage of those unable to take physical work is very low.

“The gymnasium work consists of marching, calisthenics, apparatus
work and games. As the classes develop, the games are varied and
the pupils are taught to develop poise, co-operation, skill, quick thinking,
self-control and leadership.

“Many boys report for the various athletic teams which are devel; oped during the year. Scholastic rules are strictly adhered to in the
make-up of these teams. Self-control and fairness are the elements
drilled into candidates along with team play and individual skill.
Throughout the year, interclass games and athletic meets in the various
sports are held. These create lot of interest and afford an opportunity
to the boys who cannot play with the representative teams.

“Dr. St. Georges found, upon examination, that few of the boys
needed special work. Classes in corrective gymnastics were arranged for |
these.

“During the fall and spring seasons the pupils are kept out of doors
for their gymnasium work, soccer and playground ball being played; a
great deal of interest is promoted through these games.”

Report of Miss Septa Lynn, Girls’ Physical Director,
High School:

“The addition of Physical Training examinations to the list of midyear and final examinations in the High School brings more emphatically
to the minds of both parents and pupils the importance of this subject in
the curriculum. Although there has been definite grading of all pupils
every five weeks, regular ‘exams’ in this subject were not established until
last January.

“Work is divided in this department, as heretofore, into Gymnasium
and Swimming classes. Qualifications which count for points in ‘gym’
tests are: Good posture and carriage; Quick response; )
Precision and uniformity of work; Rhythm and ease of execution.

“Effort is made to eliminate poor posture as source of poor physical development. Individual cases of round shoulders, slight curvature,
etc., receive special attention. Medical examination of all pupils and advice of Dr. Honoria K. Shine aids greatly in this phase of the work.

“As in gymnasium classes, progression is maintained throughout the .
four years in swimming. Training in life-saving methods is part of
the program here. With Miss Ruth A. Yoerg as instructor of swimming,

ay

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
ten of our girls in November took and successfully passed the tests prepared by the American Red Cross Life Saving Corps. This entitles them
to the diploma and the privilege of wearing the honor emblem of that
organization. Other girls will have the opportunity of taking these dif. ficult tests at various times during the school year.
“It  to be regretted that no suitable place is provided for outdoor
athletics for our girls. Basketball is popular during the winter months,
and track practice indoors. Our usual interclass track meet, held last
April, showed much improvement in skill and poise. Little interest, however, is evidenced in athletics in the spring months, as the great outdoors proves more alluring than indoor baseball at that time. In the fall, instruction and practice in tennis was had at the new grass court in Springdale Park. tennis tournament followed in the gymnasium later. The
girls would be much benefited by more practice in this game, but one
court affords little opportunity for the majority. very successful volley ball tournament was held later in the fall.

“The new time schedule in operation with the opening of school in
September has proved rather discouraging in the girls’ classes, especially
in connection with swimming. Six periods per week provide fair
amount of time  minutes) others  and minutes) are not satisfactory. Fifty per cent of our swimming classes must report for the
shorter periods. Allowing minimum of time for passing to and from
the main building, dressing and hair drying with limited number of dryers, the actual period in the pool is not adequate. With one exception,
all gymnasium classes report for the shorter period. Less time is required for dressing here, but with it reduced to minimum, thirty minutes is the maximum possible period for floor work.

“The following statement as to enrollment might be of interest:

“Many parents and family physicians have advised the discontinuance of swimming permanently or for winter months. This is due in
most cases to the susceptibility to colds. Those excused are assigned a
second period of ‘gym.’ when schedule permits.”

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

Report of Miss Bess E. Sullivan, School Nurse:

“Under the schedule which has been outlined for school nurses, —
weekly visits are paid to all schools in the city. Clinics have been established in several of the schools, and upon her visits the nurse has attended

 to as many as thirty cases noted by the Medical Inspector.

“Follow-up work in eye cases resulted in the furnishing of eighty
pairs of glasses to pupils. Free examination was made by local eye
specialists. Through the generosity of the J. F. Cheney Optical Com| pany, twenty-five school children were furnished with glasses free of
charge, and the remaining number supplied from the prods of the
Public School Children’s Aid Fund; Relief Department; or private donations.

“From fund raised by private subscription, we purchased thirtysix pairs of shoes for needy children, and furnished food and clothing in’

an equal number of cases.

“Through follow-up work on enlarged tonsil and adenoid cases, thirteen children were operated upon gratuitously by local surgeons.

“Through the co-operation of the Hampden County Improvement
League, morning milk service has been established in most of the
schools. Approximately children in the schools now drink milk
daily. ‘Another welfare project was ‘rummage’ sale, held on December
 through which  was raised to buy milk for undernourished
children. ,

“A new and interesting departure from the regular schedule are the

classes in Home Nursing and Child Welfare, conducted by the school
nurses in the Continuation School. Two two-hour periods are given each
week covering home care of sick and essentials of health and cleanliness.”

Report of Mr. A. Omer Hebert, Supervisor of Home and
School Gardens:

“About seven hundred boys and girls registered their intentions of
having gardens this year. Right at the start about two hundred who
wished school gardens had to be dropped owing to lack of land in the
upper section of the city available or at least suitable for the purpose.

 “The two-acre lot at Springdale, the use of which was given through
the courtesy of the Water Power Company, and the Elmwood ‘garden,
courtesy of Mr. Baush, were ploughed, fertilized and harrowed at the
cost of  for labor and  for commercial fertilizer. Two High
School boys and the assistant gardener, Mr. Moxon, helped to divide the
land into individual garden plots  ’x ’. Plots and half-plots were is/  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

sued to individuals at the rate of fifty cents half-plot. Seeds were also
furnished to the school: gardeners. About was realized from sale
of garden plots.

“Ikach plot was standardized as far as possible. Each row of vegetables ran the length of the plot, several plots being seeded at the same
time, planting line being used to secure uniformity. The rows were
 ’’,  or  apart, depending on the variety and characteristics of the
growing plant. Each garden contained the following, at least one row
of each: Swiss chard, beets, carrots, beans, bantam corn, cucumbers and
lettuce. There was some room left for individual taste in the choice of
some of the sced, but for the most part the gardens were standard.
About  was spent for seed from local dealers. Neighboring civic .
gardeners assured the director that the preparation soil this year was
much more thorough than last year, and that the number of school
gardeners was also larger. As it was, we used up nearly all the available
land. The pupil gardeners report that the variety and number of kinds
of vegetables was also larger than formerly. The gardens furnished a
gratifying amount of fresh vegetables. Several pupils sold products,
worth many times the initial cost of their gardens.

“Home gardens were problem on account of having to ferret out
both individual and garden. Hundreds of gardens were visited; suggestions for cultivation given; plant diseases discussed; etc., not only with
pupils but also with parents. [Excellent gardens were often found in outof-the-way places. In one place, for example, in tiny inner court of a
block in the congested lower part of Holyoke, was found garden
under intense cultivation; grape arbor loaded with delicious fruit, affording protection moreover for number of rabbits, ducks, geese and
chickens.

“A joint exhibit was held at the old Guyott Hotel with Miss Franz’s
canning classes. feature of the exhibit was Miss Hilda Goller’s beautiful display of fall flowers. This exhibit was transported to the Eastern
States I:xposition.

“A report of the standing of Holyoke in the Home and School Gardens’ special mention  made of Herbert Davis, who was awarded second
honors in garden work out of over thirteen hundred competitors in
Hampden County.

; “Prizes for excellence in local garden work were distributed as
follows:

“Cash prize of offered by the Holyoke Chamber of Commerce, was awarded to Miss Hilda Goller, ‘the flower girl,’ who raised
and sold over  worth of sweet peas, asters, gladioli, etc.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

“Cash prize of offered by the Holyoke School Board, awarded
to Herbert Davis, who raised over  worth of vegetables at  
Montgomery avenue. Herbert was also awarded second honors out of
  boy and girl contestants in the Hampden County Garden Club
Project.

“Cash prize of offered by the Rotary Club, was awarded to
Lewis Ruppert, Dexter street, whose account book shows over 
in garden products. ;

“Honorable mention was made of the gardens cultivated by Frederic
Goller, Clara Laudenat, Louise Flath, Olga Anthony, Ida Laskin, Herbert
Rhoda, of the Morgan School; Arthur Wals of the Elmwood School ;
Irving and Frank Davis of the Highland School; Walter Murray of the

PART II.
REPORT OF THE BOARD OF |
TRUSTEES
, To His Honor, the Mayor, the Board of Aldermen, and the
Citizens of Holyoke: |
, The Board of Trustees for Voeational Education respectfully submits the eighth annual report covering the year  :
Years of successful training of men, women and boys in
 trades and practical arts have firmly established the position —*
of Vocational Edueation in this community; it is no longer
an experiment, but an element of vital importance in our
eity.
Pupils of the Holyoke Vovational School have made good
in the various lines trained for. Girls from our Home Nursing classes have served their families and the community ina |
most acceptable manner, and several are continuing their
studies in various hospitals. Many men, beeause of the training received in our trade extension classes, now hold better
positions, and boys from our day school are on the way to
places of responsibility with both local and outside eorporations.
The most signal proof recently received of the su ss
of this school is the fact that this year the State is weleoming .
our graduates to its Teacher-Training class, and that we are
represented on the student rolls of the Fitchburg Normal
School, Tri State College, Wentworth Institute and Northeastern University.

REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL  
The statement that the work being done in our day trade
school is equal to any cannot be challenged after the exhibit
staged at the Eastern States Exposition in Springfield. All
our shops as well as the Academic Department placed their
plans and their products in the open, and Holyoke people
who were there will testify that surprise and disbelief were
often expressed, but adverse criticism on the jobs or the
school’s teaching program there was none. |
At such time and place people unconsciously compare
school work with the work of experts and specialists, because, In our shops and stores nothing else  for sale, and the
instructors found it embarrassingly difficult at times to convince experienced mechanics that the articles shown had been
really made by students. The world has not yet admitted
that boy can and will do man’s job if given manly incentive and man’s leadership.
Probably more Holyoke people became acquainted with |
the work of the school at the Exposition than would have seen
it if shown here at home, and as publicity medium for our
city it was wonderfully effective. suggestion to those who
want to advertise Holyoke is to take more space next year
at the Fair and have number of machines with power operated by the boys under direction of instructors, reproducing
as nearly as possible school conditions. Manufacturers, merehants, railroad executives, members of the United States
Senate, House of Representatives and Supreme Court as well
as Governors of several States were among our interested
visitors, and many of them returned again and again for more
definite information as to how such school was managed.
It is advisable for an institution of this kind to participate in these exhibitions frequently in order to educate the
people regarding this new type of school which has not yet
been completely sold to the public because so few know what
it is or how it  conducted.
The appreciation of the people of the city is proved by
the fact that our membership is now the highest in the school’s

history, and every class conducted under this Board during

the last year has received State approval, reimbursement and

commendation. This has been accomplished in building, the

unfitness of which has been repeatedly pointed out, with

an incomplete equipment, and for the last few years sadly
inadequate: financial support.

As to the need of new building, recent communications from the Superintendent of Schools indicate that the
rooms which have for years been used in the High School for
Vocational classes must be surrendered to accommodate the
growing demands of the Public School System, and no other
location is in sight. Discontinuance of some of this work will
be necessary unless new quarters are provided at once.
This city should not forget that two years ago the State Director of Vocational Education reminded Holyoke in letter
published in our Sixth Annual Report that she was not keeping her agreements on this point, and those who are familiar
with the situation know that, under the terms of the joint
agreement between our officials and the representatives of the

) Board of Education, State reimbursement for this school was
definitely conditioned on the fulfillment of the terms of the
agreement as made at that time.

The following figures, taken from the financial records |
of the school, audited by State Agent, speak for themselves:
