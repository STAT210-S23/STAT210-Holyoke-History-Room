REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES
FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION
To His Honor, the Mayor, and to the Citizens of Holyoke:—

The Board of Trustees for Vocational Education in this
city respectfully submit the following, their third annual report.

The conviction regarding the importance of vocational
education is steadily deepening as the need of it becomes clearer
and continued successes in it are achieved. .

The industrial call, in these modern days particularly, is
for intelligent, skillful and resourceful workmen, trained to do
good work, each in the line of his own special aptitude. Ap- |
parently there is work with good wages for good workmen, |
and there is wide-spread complaint that all too few such men )
are to be found.

The reason for this is doubtless due in large measure to ,
the fact that in the speeding up of industrial operations, with )
a view to getting the maximum of efficiency out of men and |
machinery, sufficient attention cannot be given to the young ,
shop-learner by his superiors to insure to him the acquisition ,
of habits of good workmanship. And so, in large measure :
he must, as best he can, work out his own salvation as an in-  
dustrial worker.  
,  insome cases he may sucd because of native ability and :
resolution. In most cases he will not sucd conspiciously
and may fail badly. Nor is he to be blamed under such circumstances for his failure. There are few boys who could ever
master algebra or geometry and the languages, or attain high
degree of accuracy in mechanical drawing or of skill in bridge

ae
REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL.  
The design, for example, without free and frequent access to trained
vee instructors in these subjects, such as are universally supplied.
rO\ knowledge of the best methods derived from wide observation of shop practice, rather than from the knowledge of
any one, perhaps indifferent, method that seems to bring fair
results, is by all means to be preferred. And such knowledge
cannot under ordinary circumstances be gained by the man
lope who takes his first lessons in very busy industrial plant. It
 can be secured, however, in school supplying vocational
— education when once that school is regarded seriously by all
aa concerned in it and is fully developed to meet the need.
 On the other hand, that is but partial education which
woe enables man to make good paper, to turn out an accurate suraa veying instrument, or to assemble locomotive, but does not
go far enough to enable him to describe clearly and compreget hensively the process and the history of the development of
ree the work in which he specializes. Vocational education should
  be laid on sufficiently broad lines to make it possible for him
uo Bo to attain this facility.
i  While the States have been conservative in the matter of

abe ENROLMENT.
ue The enrolments this year have been: In the Day Vocational School,  inthe Evening Practical Arts classes,  ;

  REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL.

and in the Evening Trade Extension ‘classes,  None of
these have been as large as the preceding year, though the percentage of attendance has been noticeably higher, and the difference in enrolment can be accounted for in several ways
without disparagement to the school. .

In the first place, the difficulty in securing good teachers
in the Evening School has been great, and there has been entirely inadequate room to furnish the classes when brought
together.

Again, there has been an unusual demand for labor at this
time, and the profitable character along with the eager demand
for it naturally tempted some of the day pupils to leave the
schoolornot to return to it last fall. And those men and
women, who were attracted by the inducements of high wages
outside the city, could not return early enough in the evening
to find it convenient to attend evening classes; and there has
been much overtime work in the local factories.

THE FACULTY.

During the year the Day School has lost by resignation
from the teaching force Messrs. R. A. Dowling, W. F. Grady,
E. C. Knapp, P. S. Sheehan and, quite recently, A. T. Stubbs.
In their places have been appointed Messrs. H. E. Milliken,
head of the Printing department; M. S. Herbert, head of Department of General Subjects; and P. E. Mason, assistant in
the Carpentry department on inside work, and in charge of
Cabinet Making, Charles Aspden having been advanced to
head of the department. Mr. E. G. Johnson continues in
charge of the department of Machine Shop Practice, with Mr.
C. I. Dawson assisting. Since the classes in this department
are somewhat smaller this year, it has not seemed necessary to
appoint successor as yet to Mr. Dowling. Mr. Stubbs’ resignation is of too recent date to make it possible to include the
name of his successor in this report.

It should be matter of interest to note in this connection
the list of special outside lecturers who during the year have
addressed the students and all those interested in the subjects

REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL.  
they presented: Mr. Robert Seaver, of the Seaver-Howland
| Press, Boston; Mr. O. P. Anthony, head chemist of the G. H.
- Morrill Co., Norwood, Mass., manufacturers of printing inks;
- Mr. C. E. Anderson of the Harrison Safety Boiler Works;
; Mr. H. S. Miller of the National Tube Co., who, with moving
 pictures, interestingly described to the present in the High
School Auditorium the various processes in the manufacture
  of steel tubing of all sizes; and Miss C. P. Webber, who, with
/ gas cooking demonstrations, in eight lectures from October to last, addressed five hundred persons in small groups.
These lectures vividly suggest line in which the Voca  tional School may largely serve the community generally,
  as well as the regularly enrolled students in the school.
: COURSES OF STUDY.
  During the past year there have been no new departments
; added to the Day Vocational School bevond the four mentioned
. in last year’s report. Under Mr. Herbert the department
; of General Subjects has been made more complete and now includes studies in English, Mathematics, Citizenship, American History, Industrial History, Hygiene and Physical Train- ing.
In the Evening School the various classes in Practical
. Arts and Home-Making, as enumerated in last year’s report,
! have proved popular and achieved excellent results. In the
, Trade Extension School course in Sign Painting has been add. ed and has been well attended. An urgent request from the
. painters and paper hangers has come for course in their line
. of work, and list of prospective pupils is now on file in the
' school office.
. NEW EQUIPMENT.
- In the Machine Shop department eight lathes of various
: designs and utility have been added to the equipment already
, installed, and number of useful requisites made by the depart. ment. ;
To the Steam Engineering equipment have been courteous- |
; ly loaned, by the Deane Steam Pump Company, two pumps
dee

  REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL.
and several parts of pump machinery; and various other minor
instruments of utility have been purchased.

In the Pattern Making department the addition of an
Oliver bench planer, with proper motor, and an American
pattern maker’s spindle and disc sander has made the work
thereby so much the more effective.

For use in the Trade Extension Course in Textile work,
two looms of the latest models, one an automatic Draper
and the other Knowles gem loom, have been ordered, and also
two complete hand looms similar in type to those used in the
foremost textile schools in the country for the purpose of giving the loom-fixer or weaver broader knowledge of the general
principles of weaving. 

THE HOUSE BUILDING PROJECT.

One of the notable operations of the year is the construction by the students themselves of full sized dwelling house of
eight rooms at the corner of Stanford Street and Wellesley
Road. detailed account of the origin of this project, the
several questions raised by it, and settled, and description of
the method adopted in the construction of the building and of
the finished product was published in the Holyoke Transcript
of January .

It was built according to plans drawn by Edgar Waring,
one of the students in the school, the winner in competitive
eontest with seven fellow students under the guidance of housecarpentry instructor, Mr. Knapp. It was begun in the early part
of May with the approval of the local Building Trades
Council and the Master Builder’s Association, and has been superintended by Mr. Aspden, journeyman carpenter, and Mr. Howes,
the local architect, acting in an advisory capacity, the boys doing
all the carpentry work but depending upon local contractors to
perform all the other parts of the construction.

It is quite certain now that the house will be entirely ready
for occupancy by the end of the year, and it is the intencion
of the Board of Trustees to dispose of it for price sufficient
mcrely to cover the cost of the property. The results of the exper———
REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL.  
imenc have proved so satisfactory that it may become the policy of
- the Board to build one such house each year for the sake of the
w experience it will furnish the pupils in house-carpentry at the
Vocational School.
. THE SCHOOL MILL PROPOSITION.
* very interesting offer has come to the Vocational School
i. in the latter part of the year in the form of tender to the school
- of the free use of the Mount Tom Mill of the Parson’s Division
  of the American Writing Paper Company for the education of
“ the students in the Vocational School who may be interested to
learn the trade of Paper Making. The company even goes so
far as to agree to buy the paper the students might make and donate any profits they might receive from the sale of it to the supSO port of the school.
- The Company would be willing also to grant the use of floor
space in this building for other vocational work than Paper
a Making, such as Steam Engineering, Power Plant Operation,
 Machine Shop Practice and Millwright Work, these being of a
" nature such as would bring them into direct relation with the paa per making industry.
. This generous and valuable offer has been duly referred
" to the Board of Trustees, which now has it under consideration.
“ NEW BUILDING IMPERATIVE.
ty Although the Day School enrolment during the past year
: for reasons already suggested did not crowd the building as it
nm did the previous year, the conditions of the labor market are un: usual and, on their return to normal, there is likely to be return
: of the school enrolment to larger figure even than year ago.
This will undoubtedly occur as the value of vocational education
. is better understood and appreciated.  But even this year the
. Vocational School building did not begin to accommodate the
. evening classes of men and women, many of which have been com“ pelled to meet in the High School building as has been the case
 ever since the Vocational School was started.

  REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL.
The time must surely come soon when larger quarters than the
High School Gymnasium now furnishes the school must be provided. And the city may be caught napping. Such building
should be specially built to fit its purposes as the present building
does not.
There should be separate building, simple but refined in its
architecture, for offices, class-rooms, technical library and reading rooms, sufficiently removed from the rumble and buzz and
jarring of the school’s machinery to supply the quiet necessary
for the kind of work done in such rooms. ,
The other building or buildings should be of plain, heave mill
construction, susceptible of being inexpensively added to and ,
enlarged to meet the growing needs of the school. ,
The group should be located near the present gymnasium
so that the pupils might have easy access to this for their physical |
training, but it would be well to anticipate the time when the Vo- }
cational School may find it expedient to have gymnasium of  
its own, and to plan and arrange the grouping of the buildings
accordingly.
It would be noteworthy achievement, as well as means
of reducing the cost of it, ifas much of the school building
as possible were to be constructed by the pupils themselves, and
assurance is given by the school authorities that the carpentry
work at least would, under the direction of the school teachers,
be entirely within the ability of the students to execute.
SALARY ADJUSTMENTS.
In adjusting the salaries to better satisfy the members of the
school faculty, the year has been made for them an eleven month
instead of aten month year. This extra month will make it possible for the teachers on the school staff to arrange courses of work
for the coming year more efficiently, and to equip themselves for
the same. )
Notice has been served by the State Board upon the Vocational Schools of the Stace that the instructors in them will be
expected in their leisure hours to take prescribed courses of lectures, supplied by the school or by agents of the State Board on

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
y To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen:—
- The Board organized for the year with Jesse E. Sheldon, Chairman, Hugh McLean, Vice-Chairman and Joseph
. F. Ranger, Treasurer. Mr. Ranger sucding as member
. of the Board Mr. Thomas J. Carmody, whose term of office had
 expired.
. For the first time in many years all our reservoirs were full
; to over-flowing at the beginning of the summer season, due to
 the large rainfall during the fall months of and the winter
‘ and spring months of this year. For this reason together with
- the high cost of materials and scarcity of labor it was thought
. best to postpone for another year at least the construction of the
: small intake dam on the Manhan Brook, the pipe line for which
: was built last year. In an emergency this pipe line could be
’ put into service at comparatively small cost if another very
 dry season should occur before construction work is begun on
m this Intake Dam.
Such extensions were made as the growth of the suburban
districts demanded and replacements were made only where
they were most urgently called for. The old inch main
on Ely street was replaced by an inch main before the new
paving on this street was put in; greatly improving the fire
service in this district. The inch main on Race street was
replaced by inch main from Cross street to Appleton
“ street to accomodate the large services required for new
) warehouses in this section. inch main was laid on

Chapin street and Walnut street in Elmwood, from South
street to Davis street giving much wanted reinforcement
, to water pressure in times of fires for the whole section lying
. between South and Davis Streets.

A detailed list of main pipe extensions and replacements
is to be found in the superintendent’s report to which you are
respectfully referred.

After careful study this Board decided to conform to the
usual practice of Water Works Departments in other places
and has assumed the whole task of putting in service pipe connections from the mains to the cellars, instead of from mains to

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.
the curb. Our experience so far has shown that this change
is great advantage to both the landlord and to this department. The Board has also abandoned the practice of replacing
service mains free of charge to the tenant and now requires
that charge to cover stock and time is made on all such replacements.
‘ We have also fixed small charg: for resealing valves on
fire services in the mills. Since this deparcment makes no
charge for water used in these services it is very evident that
the whole of the cost of maintaining the private fire protection
ought to fall on the parties benefitted and not any expense
should be borne by us. The amount charged while just covering the cost to us for time and materials required discourages
the careless and in some cases unnecessary breaking of seals
as was the habit in the past.
The Board is now considering action in regard to change
in the policy of making abatements for vacant tenements and
are also considering the manner in which the charge for automobiles, garden sprinklers, etc. can be arranged in more fair
and equitable manner.
The suggestion that Board of Survey be appointed, as
authorized by the Acts of  whose Approval of the layout
of new streets must be obtained is heartily seconded by this
department. Under present conditions we are increasing
the number of our dead ends in blind streets and also the number of long streets without intersecting cross streets which are
things Water Works Departments and the Insurance Companies
are very anxious to avoid. ,
During the past year communication was received from
the Engineer of the Committee of the Board of Underwriters |
for the Prevention of Fires giving the ranking of our depart- |
ment, as determined by them, in all matters relating to the put- |
ting out of fires. On the basis of per cent for perfection
we received mark of per cent and are placed in cities of
the first rank in this respect. Part of the per cent where we
are considered deficient is attributed to the dead ends in various
parts of thecity. It is the wish of all parties concerned to have
a

 
REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  

; our department always in the front rank and for that reason
. we do not wish to be penalized further for careless layouts of
- real estate speculators.
  The equity case of Louis M. Young against the City of
- Holyoke in macters relating to the construction of the dam at

the White Reservoir has been finally settled in favor of the city.
The Supreme Court has’ been sustained the decision of the
; Master who decided against Mr. Young on all points in the
. controversy. Attachments by others on money due Mr. Young
| have delay payment to him of the amount decided in his favor
 but so far as the City of Holyoke is concerned the case is ended.
; The Common Law Case of Mr. Young against the City for
. damages arising from conversion of supplies and machinery
. is still pending. The evidence has all been heard and arguments
made and we are now waiting for decision from the Master,
| who is expected to report shortly.
. The case of John Knapp against the City for damages
| arising from taking part of his farm in Southampton was tried
: during the year. The similar case of E. H. Bell still remains
| to be tried. These parcels of Jand were necessary for new Intake Dam projected in  .
‘ In regard to the dam at the White Reservoir the Board
" came to the decision that the best thing to do was to call in
engineers who were acknowledged experts in this particular
: line. Mr. Frederick P. Stearns and Mr. William S. Johnson
- were engaged to examine the dam and report to us the result
: of their findings. The time between the date of the report
" and the end of the fiscal year was too short for us to take any
. action on the recommendations contained in the report which
; is printed herewith.

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.
REPORT ON WHITE RESERVOIR DAM.
November .
Board of Water Commissioners,
Holyoke, Massachusetts.
Gentlemen :—

In accordance with your request, we have made thorough
investigation of the White Reservoir Dam on Manhan Brook,
and respectfully present the following report.

Several visits have been made to the dam, seeing it when
the reservoir was full and empty, and examinations have been
made to determine the character of the concrete of which the
dam is constructed, the extent of the leakage, and other features of importance in connection with the investigation.

Your Engineer, Mr. P. J. Lucey, has furnished us with the
results of certain surveys recently made by him, showing the

, present dimensions of the dam and spillway, and although he
was not connected with the construction of the dam has secured for us information from which we have been able to draw
conclusions as to the method of construction. This information is contained chiefly in the testimony given before master
in the case of Lewis M. Young vs. The City of Holyoke, and the

plans which were used in that case. |

The dam is of cyclopean concrete masonry, feet long,
with top width of feet. At the lowest point in the valley,
the height is feet and at this place the bottom width is  
feet. The upstream face is vertical, and the downstream face
has slope of horizontal to vertical from point about
  feet bzlow the top to feet above the bottom, where the width
is also feet. The vertical portion at the top is connected
with the slope by curve with long radius.

The crest of the spillway is feet lower than the top of  
the main dam, and is feet in length, making an angle of nearly degrees with the dam. The water approaches the spillway through forebay, and after passing over the crest flows
down channel which has concrete side walls and thin concrete floor resting on earth.

ys REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
L The main dam rests on rock which was excavated to varying
depths under some portions of the dam, and in other places
- none of the ledge was removed.  Nowell defined cut-off trench
was provided under the dam near its upstream face, which is
. the usual location for such trench, but the excavation was
carried deeper near this face, under part of the dam, than
a further downstream. |
- The main dam terminates at its easterly end, at point
where the rock is considerably below full reservoir level, and
; to prevent water from leaking through the earth overlying
ee the rock easterly from the main dam trench was excavated
  and concrete corewall built in it for distance of about  
rm feet. part of this corewall, at least, does not rest on rock,
: and it does nor extend far enough in an easterly direction to
. reach the rock at full reservoir level.
- The gate-house is located on the upstream side of the dam,
  with arrangements for drawing water either from the extreme
: bottom or from point about feet above it. Two pipes,
. and inches in diameter, respectively, extend from the
- gate-house through the dam near the bottom.
F After the completion of the masonry dam, earth was filled |
oe against its downstream face to height of about feet, so that
  the fill at the lowest point is now within feet of the top of
: the dam.
; The dam is constructed of cyclopean masonry, consisting
: of large stones embedded in concrete. On both the upstream
and downstream sides there is facing of concrete of unknown
" thickness, free from large stones. ‘The exposed portion of the
: downstream face has been plastered.
. Vertical reinforcing rods of steel, feet in length and  
: square inch in section, are placed foot apart and generally
| inches in from the upstream face, but some of them are not
; in the position intended and are exposed to view. These rods
| lap one another only foot. 
:  Construction work was begun in the summer of and :
| was completed in the summer of  considerable quantity of concrete was placed during November and December.

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.

When the reservoir is full the water comes through the conrete, especially at the joints, where one day’s work joins another, and appears on the downstream face over substantially the
entire area. In few instances considerable stream appears,
but in most cases only small quantities of water come out at
any one place. The plastering has fallen off in many places,
giving the structure an unsightly appearance, and the great
irregularity of face, due to the imperfect forms used to retain
the concrete, adds to its unsightliness. There are cracks in
the dam at some places, and the action of the water and frost
has already, although the dam has been built only four years,
loosened and spalled off not only the plaster but also pieces
of the concrete itself. |

Under most circumstances Portland cement concrete is
extremely hard, but at the dam much of the concrete is soft,
especially near the horizontal joints, so that chisel can be
driven into it for distance of inches, and in many places the
small stones in the concrete are not firmly held by the cement
and can be picked out with the hand.

Investigations by means of test wells in the vicinity of
the corewall at the east end of the dam indicate that water
passes through, under or around the end of the corewall in con- ,
siderable quantity. This leakage is so considerable that ,
drain has been constructed to collect and remove it. The total ,
leakage past the dam, measured when the water in the reser- :
voir was about foot below the crest of the spillway, amounted |
to gallons per day. This included both the water which |
was passing the main dam and that passing the corewall.

Studies have been made to ascertain the stability of the ,
dam, that is, its resistance against overturning and slipping. ,
In these studies, when account was taken of the probable I.
upward water pressure on the base but not of the pressure
which may result from the expansion of sheet of ice on the
surface of the reservoir, it was found that dam of the size of
the one under consideration, if it were first class structure .
such as this dam would have been if built in strict accordance
with the specifications, would probably be stable, although .

ee a
REPORT OF WATER BOARD. the factor of safety would be small. Witha reasonable allowance
- for ice pressure, however, the dam is not as safe as so important
re structure should be, in view of the damage and possible loss
. of life which would result from its failure.
. The masonry gate-house attached to the upstream side of
- the main dam adds considerable element of strength at one
- point in its length, but not enough to modify our view as to the
  necessity for strengthening the dam.
: It must be rem mbered that we ar? dealing with adam which
  is not first class structure, and one in which the concrete has
. limited strength and in which portion of the downstream
: face exposed to the combined action of water and frost is dis., integrating to an important extent. similar disintegration
. of the concrete on the upstream face is occurring, but to much
- less extent because this face is generally protected by the water
' from the action of frost. The poor character of the work and
. the progressive disintegration of the concrete on the down stream face are important factors in the recommendations
. which we make subsequently for the strengthening of the dam.
. The vertical rods near the upstream face of the dam would
. add greatly to the strength of the upper portion of the structure
. if they were long rods, or even with the short rods used if they
  were lapped sufficiently by one another and were embedded
, in concrete which would grip them tightly, but the value of
: short rods, lapped only foot, embedded in concrete which
 does not have firm grip upon them, is very small.
“ Computations show that the spillway, if the forebay is
- not obstructed with ice, has suffcient capacity for taking care
 of the greatest probable freshet flow without raising the water
; in the reservoir above the top of the main dam.
S RECOMMENDATIONS.
: We recommend as the simplest and cheapest method of
satisfactorily strengthening the main dam that an earth fill
a be made against the downstream face, extending to about the
a level of high water, having top width of fifteen feet and
  slope of horizontal to vertical. Such fill would make

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.

the structure safe from overturning or slipping, would prevent
further disintegration of the concrete on the downstream face,
and would cover the unsightly portions of the concrete.

As preliminary to the making of this fill, few of the important leaks through the concrete of the main dam should
be stopped by grouting.

The pipes which carry water under the earth fill now existing against the lower face of the dam should be removed, because they would not stand the weight of the higher embankment
without braking, and should be replaced with concrete culvert which would be strong enough to sustain the weight of the
fill recommended. We will not attempc at this time to define
in detail what should be done at this place, but it seems probable that the best design would be concrete culvert of horseshoe shape, about feet in diameter, with no pip in it at
first but with an opportunity to extend the  -inch pipe through
it if itshould be found desirable in the future to extend the main
pipe leading toward the city to this dam.

Although the further disintegration of the concrete on the
downstream side of the dam would be prevented by the earth
fill, the upstream face would still be liable to deteriorate to some
extent, but as this face is protected by che water large part of
the time, the action is not likely to be rapid. Moreover, with
the pressure of the earth fill against the downstream side neutralizing large part of the pressure of the water against the
upstream side, the dam will have very large factor of safety
so that considerable deterioration could occur on the upstream
side without affecting its stability.

In addition to the repairs at the main dam, we recommend
stopping the leakage past the corewall at the easterly end of
thedam. In order to do this trench with sloping side should
be excavated to solid rock, laying bare the upstream side of
the corewall, and where the corewall does not rest on rock it
should be carried down to rock. The rock should be tested
by drilling into it to ascertain if there are leaky seams, and
if these are found they should be grouted. The trench should
then be refilled with clay or other fine and impervious mafiir 
REPORT OF WATER BOARD. .
os terial. If necessary to prevent the movement of the corewell
ie when the trench on its upstream side is excavated, some of
. the earth on the downstream side should be removed to re- lieve the pressure. The corewall should also be extended
- easterly until it reaches the ledge.

There is possibility of ice accumulating in the forebay
oe of the spillway to such an extent as to interfere with its efficiency, but we do not recommend changes, believing that the
. undue accumulation of ice where it would obstruct the flow
. over the spillway in the case of great freshet should be pre. vented by occasional ice cutting by the maintenance force.

" The channel leading from the spillway to the brook is like- ly to deteriorate quite rapidly as the thin bottom of rather
  poor concrete rests on earth, but any damage to this channel
| will not seriously threaten the dam, and the channel can be
- repaired or rebuilt without serious difficulty.
. As it is impracticable to begin the strengthening of the dam
- before next spring, it is desirable in order to avoid risk up to
. the time when the repairs are made, and especially the risk
| which would be incurred by maintaining full reservoir during
the winter, that the ordinary level of the water in the reservoir
, be maintained feet below the crest of the spillway.
: The waste pipes have sufficient capacity to take care of
ordinary freshets, so that the water is not likely to rise to the
level of the spillway crest, but we recognize that it is possible
; that very great freshet may occur which will temporarily
fill the reservoir and cause the water to flow over the spillway.
/ We do not expect that this will occur, but if it should there
would be no ice pressure or trouble from ice, and in view of
) the fact that the dam has already sustained the pressure of a
full reservoir we believe there would be no serious risk if the
above recommendation is followed, provided the repairs are
: made without delay.
OTHER SUGGESTIONS.
In connection with any repairs which may be made to the
dam, it would seem to be of great importance to consider also

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.

whether the best development of the water supply of the city
of Holyoke does not require the enlargement of the reservoir
by the raising of the dam. Preparation for the construction
of higher dam can probably be made now in connection with
the strengthening of the present dam, at less cost than would
be possible later.

It is evident that to meet the future requirements of the
city, the storage on Manhan and Tucker Brooks must be fully
developed so that large proportion of the water flowing at :
the times of high flow may be saved for use in the dry seasons.

The reservoir formed by the White Dam has capacity |

of about gallons and water shed of square miles. |
This storage of gallons per square mile of watershed is so small in comparison with the watershed that large i
part of the water flowing in the brook must go over the dam.
In order to get reasonable development of this watershed the
storage should be at least doubled. It would appear to be perfectly feasible to obtain this storage at White Reservoir by raising the dam and extending low dike easterly to the hill across
the highway. It is probable that in no other part of the watershed could this storage be obtained at so small an expense.

Another way of storing an additional quantity of this water
would be to divert the overflow into small stream to the east
on which large storage reservoir can be constructed.

To determine which of these projects is the better or whether both should be adopted is matter requiring further study,
but it is desirable that such study should be made before
making any changes in the present dam. |

If it is found that it will be desirable to raise the dam |
and increase the storage, it is probable that the best form of |
construction would be an earth dam, using the presenc dam for ,
a corewall. If an earth dam is to be built, it may be best to
place an earth fill on both sides of the dam now and make the
changes in the inlets so that the raising can be done when |
necessary without emptying the reservoir. The emptying of
the reservoir may be very serious thing at later date when

the consumption of water, especially in the high service dis- trict, has increased.

It is desirable, also, in connection with any repairs that
may be made, that provision be made at the gate-house for

: drawing water from the reservoir at point not more than

. or feet beneath the surface, not only when the reservoir
is full but when it is drawn down or feet. In reservoir

  of this character the water in the bottom becomes foul in the

- summer and autumn, while the water near the surface may be

. of comparatively good quality. With the present arrange  ments it is necessary when drawing water to take it from near

- the bottom where the worst water is to be found.

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.

During the past year the wages of the workmen were increased to conform to schedule recommended by the Board of
Aldermen and all the other expenditures necessary to maintain water works department have followed rising market.

For the last decade the expenses of our Department have
increased faster than the revenue from the water rents. At
the present time there is sufficient margin between receipts
and fixed charges to pay for the ordinary extensions, but if
expenses of maintenance and construction continue to go up
and receipts remain stationary or almost so, it will be only a
matter of few years before water takers may expect revision
of water rates on higher schedule.

The receipts from water rents were and the
gross receipts for the year which is  more
than the gross receipts for the preding year. The expenditures were This includes taxes paid to the City

| by the Department amounting to interest on bonds

The Sinking Fund account was increased  during
the year,  of this amount beimg the earnings on the
investment. The total amount in the sinking fund at the close
of the year was leaving the net bonded indebtedness of the Department  on November .

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT
| To the Honorable Board of Water Commissioners:
Gentlemen: have the honor to present to you the report
of your superintendent for the year ending November .

The condition of the water furnished during the whole of
the year was very good; there being no noticeable tastes or
odors and very little complaint received from dirty water in
the mains.

The rainfall was above the average for the year and was
particularly so for the summer months. For this reason the
quantity required for lawn sprinkling was not as much as usual
and the average daily consumption per capita for the year
was about gallons.

. All the reservoirs were filled at the beginning of the summer
and the quantity now in storage in our local reservoirs is about
  million gallons, practically what it was year ago at
this time. With winter and spring of average rainfall and
with the usual rate of consumption, our reservoirs should fill
again early in  .

As the price of material was high and labor was scarce
only such extensions as were required and such replacements
as were urgent were made during the year as shown in the
table annexed to this report.

Congestion of freight and railroad embargoes delayed
shipments of pipe so that pipe extensions were not made at
most convenient times, particularly in the case of new tracts
where houses were built on new streets in which we had not yet
laid our mains. These houses were supplied through small
temporary mains laid just underground until such time as our
large pipe arrived and could be installed.

During the past year this department has assumed the responsibility for installation and maintaining of service pipes

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.
from the mains to the cellars, which is distinct advantage to
both this department ard the owner. list of main pipe ex, tension and replacement and cost of same is annexed herewith.
) The matter of resealing valves on fire sprinklers in mills
had grown to such proportions that during the year small fee
to meet the expense of resealing was imposed. ‘The revenue
from it is small but it covers the cost of resealing and at the
same time does away with some unnecessary breaking of seals. |
No unusual work was done at any of the reservoirs during
the year except that at the Fomer reservoir where necessary
repairs were made on the Tucker brook weir-drains putin for
the caretaker’s house and barn and the piers for new bridge
across the overflow canal were built. If the present high price
of materials and the scarcity of labor should prevail during the
coming year attention should be given firsc to those extensions
and repairs which are absolutely necessary and work .relating
to City Beautiful, reforestration, etc. put over for another season at least.
Thanking you for your co-operation and courtesy of the
‘past year this report is respectfully submitted.
PATRICK GEAR,
Superintendent.

REPORT OF THE
Gas and Electric Department
City of Holyoke, Massachusetts.
Office of Gas and Electric Department,
January .
To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen:
Gentlemen:—
| have the honor to submit herewith, the report of the
Gas and Electric Department for the year ending November
  the same being the fourteenth annual report of the
department.
THE GAS WORKS.

The gas sent out during the year was cubic
feet and in the send-out was  an increase of
  over the year  .

The receipts for gas sold in were  as compared with an increase of  or an increase
of  .

About feet of gas mains were laid during the year,
  new gas services run and new gas meters set. This is
a gain of in the gas meters in use. :

The receipts for by-products amounted to 
divided as follows:

Cash received for coke............... 

Cash received for tar.................  

Cash received for Ammonia...........  

The receipts for by-products have increased over  
during the past year.

. The abnormal increase in the prices of everything necessary
to produce gas causes the Department to show loss of about

REPORT OF GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT.  
$  this year at the Gas Works, where there was profit
of about  year ago.

Coal has increased about and gas oil about  
over last year’s prices. In three items alone coal, gas oil and
labor, the increased cost amounts to The increase
in the amount of gas sold has not kept pace with the increased
cost of production. Recent quotations indicate that still higher
prices will further increase the cost of operation in  .

There are many improvements that should be made at
the Gas Works, including new scrubber, exhauster, condenser,
tar extractor and station meter to keep pace with the increased
output. The maximum capacity of these machines is about
one million cubic feet per day. On September  
cubic feet of gas were sent out. This is dangerously close
to the maximum capacity of some, if not all of the apparatus
mentioned above.

If conditions were normal and prites somewhere within
reach, we would recommend that the above apparatus be replaced by apparatus of greater capacity, but with the constantly
rising prices of machinery, it does not seem advisable to make
such recommendations at this time. We cannot however, postpone indefinitely the purchase of some of this machinery, and
it is possible that we may be obliged to buy some machinery
of increased capacity before the year ends.

THE ELECTRIC STATION.

The amount of electricity generated during the past year
was kilowatts while the current sent out amounted
to kilowatts, an increase of over the sendout of the send-out in being kilowatts.

The receipts for electricity sold in amounted to  and in the receipts were therefore
  shows an increase of or an increase of  
in the receipts of electricity.

We have in use more electric meters than we had in
 meters having been set in  Of the meters
set, were set in old buildings and in new buildings.

  REPORT OF GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT.

Nineteen new magnetite lamps were installed in the City,
nine on High Street between Hampden Street and Prospect
Street and ten on Cabot Street between Park Street and Canal
Street, making total of magnetite lamps now installed
in the City.

Ducts feet in length have been placed under ground
between Hampden Street and Prospect Street. Up to the present time only cables for street lights have been placed in the
ducts but it is the intention of the Department to draw in primary and secondary cables and remove the present overhead
wires owned by the city as soon as the financial conditions

  of the Department permit of such action.

The lighting system in Prospect Park has been placed under
ground and Type ‘“‘C”’ lamps have been installed along the bank
wall, making marked improvement in the lighting of the Park.

All arc lamps in stores, in number, and all street arc
lamps, in number, have been replaced with Type ‘‘C”
lamps of candle power and new street lamps have been
installed in addition, making the total number of street lamps.
in the City  .

In  the last year that the plants were operated by a
private company, the City paid  for street lighting,
at which time the City had but street lamps in use. For
the year  the City paid the Department  for
street lighting. In  there were street lamps in use.

At the Electric Station, the increased price of materials
has reduced the profits of the year about but because of the greatly increased sales of electricity, the station
shows profit of about  for the year.

| The most pressing requirements at the Electric Station is
for additional coal storage capacity. At present we are able
to store only from two to three weeks’ supply and there is no
possible chance of increasing this storage because nearly all
the land owned by the City is now covered with buildings.
During the past few years, the Department has leased land from
the Holyoke Water Power Company adjoining the Holyoke.
and Westfield Railroad tracks and upon this land it has stored

REPORT OF GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT.  
coal for emergency purposes. When the rental of the land and
the unloading and cartage of coal is taken into consideration,
this is pretty expensive proposition. During the past year,
it has added about  per ton to the cost of the coal, in scorage.

With the constantly increasing business at the Electric
Station it is very probable that new boilers will be required
within very short time. With the new boilers, it will also
be necessary to install new turbo-generator in place of one
of the old and less efficient ones now in use.

It is estimated that the cost of such changes including the
cost of building coal pocket along the Holyoke and Westfield
Railroad siding would be nearly .

The Department is rather inclined to favor the construction of an entirely new plant located somewhere along the river
front in preference to making the changes noted above. A
new plant located where water would be available at all times
for condensing purposes would materially reduce the operating
cost. The Deparcment is now studying all phases of this

 question and hopes to have something definite to present for
your consideration during the coming year.

About twenty-five years ago the present water wheels
were installed at the Electric Station. These water wheels
are now entirely inadequate and only of the efficiency
of the water is obtained from them. As the Department has
to pay fixed sum, about  per day for the water power,
if available, whether same is used or not, it is evident that
wheels of modern construction of greater efficiency with the
direct driven generator would result in considerable saving
in the operating cost. It is figured that the saving would amount
to at least  per year.

Respectfully submitted,
JOHN J. KIRKPATRICK.
Manager.

Dear Sir:—

We have completed the audit of the accounts of the Holyoke Gas Electric Deparcment for the year ended November
  Verified the Cash Balance, balance of the General
Ledger, Sundries Sales Ledger, Vouchers for Payment, the
footings, the pay rolls, and depreciation account.

The Balance Sheet and Profit Loss statements are accurately prepared from the accounts as shown by the books
of the Department, based on inventories prepared by the heads
of the departments, and to the best of my knowledge and belief are correct financial statements of the Department.

Respectfully submitted,

REPORT OF THE
FIRE COMMISSIONERS
Office of Fire Commissioners.
Holyoke, Mass., December  d,  .
To the Honorable Mayor and Aldermen:—

Gentlemen. We take pleasure in submitting to you the
report of the Fire Department for the year ending December  ,
 .

The Board of Fire Commissioners consisting of Sidney E.
Whiting, George C. Robert and James H. O’Connell met
January  and organized by the election of Sidney E.
Whiting,-as Chairman, George C. Robert, as Vice-Chairman
and John Hildreth, as Secretary.

There have been fires and alarms during the past year.
This is less than last year. The reason for this large decrease
is, we believe, owing to the thorough inspection of buildings
and the greater care exercised by the citizens generally in the
accumulation of rubbish. The losses on buildings amounted
co  and the losses on contents amounted to ,
making the total fire loss The property endangered by fire amounted to  and the insurance on
said property amounted to The insurance
companies paid the sum leaving net loss on the
  fires and alarms of only or an average on each alarm
and fire of only ‘The foregoing figures testify to the high
state of efficiency of the Fire Department.

The most serious fires were the C. F. Sullivan Company,
the one at the School of Our Lady of Perpetual Help and Lewis
MM. Pitolsky.

Your Commissioners appreciate the excellent work of the
Department and extend to both Officers and Men, their congratulations for the faithful manner in which they have perREPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.  
formed their difficult and hazardous duties, and we wish to
commend especially, Deputy Chief, Daniel J. Gorman; Captain,
George F. Orrell; Firemen, Timothy Doherty, William F.
Herbert; George F. Manning and Michael Lacey for their
heroic work in saving human lives at fires, and we feel sure we )
are expressing the sentiment of the general public in publicly
acknowledging our appreciation of their good work, and we
gladly place them on the roll of honor.

We regret to have to record the death of Lieutenant John

J. Manning, who died on January He was member
of the Fire Department for.over years, and the city loses a
valuable servant by his death.
Three persons have lost their lives by fire during the year,
viz:—Eileen Riley, aged four years, on January cause:
playing with matches; Mrs. Arthur Coulombe, age years,
on September cause, careless use of kerosene and,
Volia Dupuis, aged years, on September cause,
playing with matches.

Sixteen fires were caused by children playing with matches,
and we respectfully urge our citizens to use greater care in the
use and storage of matches.

There were alarms caused by the careless deposit of
hot ashes. little care in the proper disposition of hot ashes
would prevent many useless runs of the Fire Department
apparatus, and would reduce the cost of maintenance considerably.

Carelessly throwing away cigarette stubs caused fires
in  Inthe year  alarms were caused by the careless disposition of cigar and cigarette stubs. We drew attention
to this in our last report, and we are much gratified at the great
decrease in alarms from this cause, and we hope that even greater care will be exercised in this matter, so that the number of
alarms from this cause may be still further decreased.

We again urge that our business men use the greatest care
possible in the storage of waste paper and rubbish in the basements, and we are glad to say that there has been marked
improvement in this respect.

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.

There have been numerous accidents to firemen this year,
but none of them were of such permanent character to injure
the men.

The introduction into the department of motor-driven
apparatus makes it even more desirable than heretofore, that the
Department should have the right of way, and we urge that pedestrians when an alarm is rung, should keep on the sidewalk,
and that all teams and apparatus be drawn as near as possible
to the sidewalk, so as to give as clear street as possible for the
fire apparatus. careful observance of this rule would greatly
facilitate the work of the department. few moments lost
from this cause is often very costly, as the first few minutes of
the fire determines whether it will be large or small fire.

During this last year we have purchased and installed a
new Seagrave gallon Combination Hose and Pumper,
at cost of This piece of apparatus displaces two horses,
two steam fire engines and gives us the services of two men.

We have contracted for gallon pumper which Is to
be placed in Elmwood when delivered, and this will displace
five horses and gives us the services of two drivers as active
firemen.

We have also purchased an automobile for the Chief and
the First Deputy Chief. These additions will greatly add to
the efficiency of the department.

We have had designed two hose boxes which hold  
feet of hose each, and ready to be used ata fire. The only thing

“necessary to be done is, that the hose wagon should back underneath and the hose box is lowered into the wagon and it
is then immediately ready for work. In case of large fire or
two fires coming in succession, the advantage of having  
feet of hose ready is apparent, and we consider this is great
improvement on the old style of loading.

Your Commissioners respectfully make the following
recommendations, and we urge that you give them your careful consideration and that in the making of the appropriations,
you will make them sufficiently large to enable the Commissioners to carry them into effect.

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.  

First:—We recommend the complete motorization of the
Department. careful investigation of the cost of motordriven apparatus as against horse-driven apparatus has shown
that the motor-driven apparatus is very much more economical
and more efficient, and the art of building motor apparatus has
advanced to such state of perfection, that we believe it is now
entirely safe to motorize the Department. This is being done
in almost all the large fire departments, and if we are to keep up
Our reputation as first-class Fire Department, we must take
this step.

Some of our steam fire engines are old and antiquated and
must be replaced soon, and it would be foolish to replace them
with steam fire engines, as they are less efficient and more
costly in every way.

We should need the following pieces of apparatus to completely motorize the Department as follows, viz:—

House No. gallon hose and pumping engine.

,; House No. Tractor for steam fire engine.

House No. gallon triple combination automobile.

House No. Tractor for steam fire engine.

House No. automobile hook and ladder truck.

House No. Combination Hose and Chemical automobile.

House No. automobile hook and ladder truck.

These would cost approximately the following sums:

  gallon pump 

  gallon pump  

Combination Hose and Chemical  

  Hook and Ladder Trucks  

: Tractors for Engines  
Total 

Second: The National Board of Fire Underwriters in their
letter dated August  recommended the additions to
the permanent force in the Fire Department, as one of its greatest needs, and they claim we are twenty-five men short. The

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.
motorization of the department will give us the use of at least
eight men and with ten additional men appointed, we believe
the Department would be equipped in manner satisfactory
to the National Board of Fire Underwriters. We therefore
recommend the addition of ten men to the fire force of the City.
The days off and the time taken by the men going to meals
makes this addition imperative.

Third: For many years we have recommended the building of new engine house in Ward One. The introduction of
motor driven apparatus has changed conditions materially in
this Ward and we believe the present Engine House can be so
changed by adding one or two stories, at moderate cost,
sO as to give the men individual sleeping rooms and greater
accomodation, and the location is so excellent that we think
it would be difficult to improve it in many respects. We therefore recommend that the above changes be made.

Fourth: We recommend that Station No. Two at South
Holyoke be so changed as to give the men individual sleeping
rooms, and that there be drill tower erected there, so that
the men can be trained in the use of modern fire equipment.
We have had number of men in the department trained for
this work, but have never been able to carry out the same fully,
for want of drill tower. The National Board of Fire Underwriters recommend the erection of this tower.

Fifth: The National Board of Fire Underwriters recommend
the adoption and enforcement of an up-to-date code of building laws, which recommendation your Board:of Fire Commissioners readily join.

‘ Sixth: For several years the Men and Officers have petitioned your Board for an increase in pay, but the appropria- ,
tions made to the Fire Department has made it impossible

to grant such increase. The increased cost of living which

is felt by everybody has compelled your Board to give this

matter serious attention, and we are satisfied that an increase

in salaries, both Officers and Men, is imperative, and we therefore recommend that there should be raise of salaries of both

Officers and Men in the Department, and trust that approREPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.  
priations you make will be sufficiently large to enable your
Commissioners to make this increase.

Seventh: We recommend that there should be special
appropriation of  for cable extensions, test posts and street
signals. .

Eighth: We recommend that there should be appropriated at least  for the purchase of new hose.

The adoption of the above recommendations, we believe,
will cover the demands made by the National Board of Fire
Underwriters, and in their letter to us they commend the Department in every respect except as above.

We take this opportunity to thank the Mayor and Board

FIRE ALARM TELEGRAPH.

With the installation of our new Fire Alarm system, our
department will be equipped with the most modern and complete fire alarm system that has been installed, and this ought
to be sufficient to cover the city’s needs for many years to come.
The apparatus is practically complete, and we trust the citizens will avail themselves of the opportunity of inspecting
the same, and we are sure they will agree that the city is fully
protected by this new system.

The value of the apparatus and equipment in this department is as follows, viz:—

$ 

The following is list of the apparatus in the Fire Department, viz:

  Chief’s automobile.

  Chief’s buggy. |

  Deputy Chief’s automobiles.

  horse-driven Superintendent’s Fire Alarm Wagon.

  Steam Fire Engines.

  aerial ladders with tractor.

  hook and ladder trucks, horse-drawn.

  Combination hose and chemical wagon.

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.  

  two-horse hose wagons.

  two-horse exercise wagons.

  motor-driven chemical and hose wagons.

  water tower.

  two-horse hose sleighs.

  two-horse hose sleighs with chemical tanks.

HAY AND FEED.

Owing to the very high cost of feed and bedding, the maintenance of this department has been very expensive, and our
experience with motor-driven’ apparatus has proven that the
quicker the Department is motorized, the better it will be for
the city, both from the scandpoint of cost of maintenance and
efficiency of service.

HOUSES.

The houses are in good condition, except House Number
Four, which should be remodeled.

We have made several recommendations respecting the
houses, to which we draw your attention.

HOSE.
We have on hand feet of good hose, feet of
‘fair hose and feet of hose which should be replaced at an
early date, as it is risky to depend on hose which has been in
this department for number of years.

The following is the amount of hose on hand:

HORSES.

| There are now twenty-three horses in the department, and
more than half of them are rapidly growing unfit for duty in

|
  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.
the fire department. The average age of these horses is twelve
years, and it will be necessary either to replace them, or to carry
out the recommendation of the Commissioners and motorize
the department. To purchase sufficient number of horses
at the present time,  would cost us about  to replace
the ones that are unfit. This amount added to the cost of
keeping these horses, namely, about  for one year, would
make the sum of which would purchase motor-driven
apparatus that would greatly exd in efficiency the apparatus
that is drawn by these horses, and there is another fact to be
taken into consideration in this matter, that, driver of horsedriven apparatus is not able to give any fire service, because
he has to take care of his horses, while the driver of motordriven piece of apparatus is expected to, and does active work
at fires.
INSPECTION OF BUILDINGS.

It will be noticed that the inspection of buildings has been
more than doubled this year, namely,  and the adoption
of the Cincinnati Ordinance by the City Government, and the
thorough inspection which we have made is responsible to a
large extent for the decreased number of fires, and we have to
acknowledge the general courtesy and willingness on the part
of the Citizens to co-operate in carrying out the provisions of
said Ordinance, but there are some who seem to think that the
Fire Department, in their efforts to make the city safe, are intruding upon their private rights.

PROSPECT PARK. :
The principal work accomplished on this park was the
installing of the new lights on the Parapet Wall. This was
done with the assistance of the manager of the Gas and Electric Department. The west end of the park was graded from
Elm Street to the ice house and the grass plots from High to
Elm Street were reseeded in the Spring and temporary wire
fence placed around the plots to protect the turf. large
flower bed was placed at the Chestnut street entrance. The
Board would like to finish the improvements on this park the
coming year by the laving of new walk along the park bordering Prospect Street and the improving of the entrances at
High and Elm Streets; also the reseeding of the plot just graded
and the addition of two new fountains.
ELMIWOOD PARK.
This park has been kept in excellent condition but no
progress has been made in the contemplated improvements.
 The Bh Street play field was graded and seeded and new
back-stop and fence erected. This work was done by the Playgrounds Commission. The skating rink was enlarged and will
provide better accomodations for the large crowds who enjoy
this rink. shelter for the women and children using this
park is much needed and the Board would solicit an appropriation to continue the improvement work here.
RIVERSIDE PARK.

and although small in area provide excellent open air breathing ,
spots for the people of this section of the city which is largely
populated.

would be appreciated by the people using the park. The flowers and turf are kept in good condition and the park enjoyed
by the residents of this locality.

JONES PARK. :

This park has not been used to any extent as no accomodations are provided here. The Board would ask an appropriation to start improvements at this park and to set out

To his Honor, the Mayor, and the Board of Aldermen:

I submit you my report, as inspector of animals. On account of the prevalence of glanders in Holyoke in  have
made weekly inspections of all the stables this year. have
examined forty-nine dairies.

Number of Dairy Cattle......................  

Number of Swine................... ... ..  

Number of Horses............. ... ......... 

I have condemned six horses suffering with glanders
and thirteen cows suffering with tuberculosis. have made
weekly inspections of the Sales Stables and find at the
present time that the animals throughout the city are in good
healthy condition.

Sincerely yours,
DR. JOHN J. MOYNAHAN,
Inspector of Animals.

Report of the Planning Board
To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen:

The Planning Board respectfully submit the following report covering the year  The Board has had numerous
conferences during the year, the subject matter of which has
been chiefly concerned with several developments of immediate
importance to the city. At conference with the Mayor and
other City Officials regarding the location of rest room,
the Planning Board approved unanimously the present location
and feel that no one public improvement of recent date has
added more to the convenience of the people of Holyoke.
The removal and development of the dangerous corner at
junction of Dwight and Northampton Streets has had the attention of the Planning Board and we also recommend and
urge similar treatment of the Lincoln and Northampton
street corner. Considerable time and attention has been given
to plans for the southern extension of High Street by the
Board. City Engineer McCarthy prepared comprehendise
plans and sketches showing several different possibilities for
the extension of High Street, giving also an approximate estimate of cost for each of the several routes. These sketches
appeared in the local newspapers, together with brief description of the several routes and estimated costs. This feature of Holyoke’s development is an important one and bound
to be brought to an issue as to choice of routes in the near
future. By setting forth to the Public the various routes,
the Board hopes to be of service in determining the best solution of this important development. The fact that the planning Board is more or less free from the duty of dealing with
many immediately pressing details that concern the regular

REPORT OF THE PLANNING BOARD  

City Officials, makes it possible for the Board to make itself
of valuable service to the city by taking the initiative in studying matters of grave importance for the future of the city,
while also co-operating with the regular city departments in any development of the immediate problems. Planning
Board reports from numerous cities indicate the importance
these various boards place on the working out of definite city
plan incorporating the best possibilities for the future development of the city. The Board feels that start should be
made toward city plan for Holyoke, showing how to wisely
continue her present development and make the most of her
splendid natural resources. However, the Board realizes the
handicap of the past year, namely, the lack of any appropriation to work on such plans. The compiling and assembling of
such data should be properly assigned to clerk. Expert advice should be available to the Board from time to
time in the development of the city plan in order that the ideas
incorporated in the plan be of the highest type. Unless the —
above is accessible to the Board in the near future, very little
of actual worth for future development can be presented by the Board and their work should seem to be of negligible value.

Report of the City Auditor
To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen: .
Gentlemen:—

I present herewith the annual statement of the receipts
and expenditures for the fiscal year  in the form and manner required by the State of Massachusetts.

I have audited the accounts of the City Clerk, the Milk
Inspector, the Water Department, and the Gas and Electric
department, found them correct, the receipts properly recorded
and promptly deposited, and the expenditures approved in
due form. The Tax Collector’s books and entries have been
audited so far as possible. The postings here reach the thousands and as each is separately checked, it takes quite while
to complete his accounts. The report also contains detailed
report of the expenditures in the Contingent Unclassified account, Salaries account, City Indebtedness, Sinking Funds
and Tax Collector’s Exhibit, the bonds issued during the year
with the purpose for which they were issued, the cash on hand
and the borrowing capacity.

There was  borrowed during the year for the following purposes: Highways Construction, Sidewalks
Construction, Sewers Construction, Playground Equipment, Fire Department Equipment,
$ Street Flushing Machine, Isolation Hospital,
$ Tuberculosis Hospital Construction, Schools,
$ Central Engine House Equipment, Infantile
Paralysis Epidemic, .

Payments of che City Debt and additions to the Sinking
Fund were as follows: Serial Bonds, City Debt from
Sinking Fund, Water debt serial, Holyoke &
Westfield R. R. debt serial, Gas and Electric debt

The Maintenance of the Water, Gas and Electric departments is not
included in the foregoing diagram because those departments maintain
themselves without any cost to the taxpayers.
As matter of fact the Water Department pays about 
a year net to the city in taxes, while the Gas Department, by its
low rates for lighting and power and the maintenance of certain lights at
its OWN expense, contributes its share towards lessening the taxpayer's
burden, in addition to which it contributed  to the appropriations
for city purposes this year.
Respectfully,
D. W. KENNEY,
