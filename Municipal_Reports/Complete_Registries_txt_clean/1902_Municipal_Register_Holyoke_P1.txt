MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
Gentlemen of the Board of Aldermen :-—

The past year has been an eventful one in the municipal
history of Holyoke. Progress has been made in almost every
line and with the members of the different Boards and Departments working in harmony, the tax payers have received full )
value for the money expended. As the city grows the municipal

 problems increase, requiring our best efforts for its advancement.
. During the past four years the city has not been compelled
to borrow money to pay its running expenses. For this year
: again the report of the City Auditor shows balance on hand,
notwithstanding the unexpected expenditure of about 
due to the epidemic of small-pox.
FINANCIAL STATEMENT. .

It is not necessary to give in full the statement of the City.
Auditor which is published each month. The net bonded debt
of the city for the past five years is as follows, viz :—

system. Since December last, our debt has been increased by |
the issuing of  in bonds for the purchase of the gas and
electric light plants. The total valuation of the city on May  ,
 was Our tax rate was  on the thousand. The assessed valuation of the property belonging to the
. city was  showing an excess of assets beyond liabilities of .
MUNICIPAL GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT.

This year for the first time the gas and electric department |
becomes reality. The long and tedious litigation has been
closed and the gas and electric plants acquired from the Holyoke
Water Power Co. at valuation made by the Commissioners of
$  together with legal expenses and costs of  |
making total cost of ,

It now depends to large measure upon the interest taken by the citizens in these plants, whether municipal ownership in

‘Holyoke shall be success or failure. The gas plant isin fair
condition and with the expenditure of possibly  will be suitable for the demands of the immediate future. The electric
department, however, has reached the limit of its capacity and it
is problem as to. how the increased demands can be best met
without large expenditure of money. The best policy seems”
to be gradual reorganization of the plant along the most approved lines. This cannot be done at once and should be done
as our income permits. Additional capacity must be supplied
immediately, however, to meet the present demand, the number
of our street lights should be increased and the present antiquated
style of lamp changed to the enclosed arc, giving both better

' lighting and greater economy in maintenance. To make the
necessary additions will cost about The most difficult
part of the electric problem comes from the impossibility of storing electricity. We must produce it as fast as it is wanted, therefore must have power enough for the greatest demand which is  
only from sunset until the stores are closed and then only for
two nights each week. In this way as much power and machinery

| MAYOR'S ADDRESS.  
are required as if the greatest demand were constant. As we pay
for twelve mill powers of water whether in use or not and as we
must have sufficient machinery for the greatest demand which |

| will be used only small fraction of the time, we will have considerable surplus capacity, except for few hours each day.
Hence it is necessary to dispose of this surplus power in the day
 time for business purposes. From seven o'clock at night until
the next morning there will be also surplus capacity and idle
machinery except for two nights each week when the stores are
open. All this power probably cannot be seld so it will be good
policy for the city to use it in some inexpensive way. It may be
well to use it to light up some of our alley ways and especially
. dark places near the center of the city. This extra power might
be sold to our merchants who desire to make display for advertising purposes as is done in many cities, to be used only after
business hours. .

Under the law we are compelled to charge off each year five per cent for depreciation and pay each year an installment of our
bond issue of  in addition to per cent interest. It
can readily be seen therefore that the most careful management
is required in order that this department may prove successful.
The increased demands should be met as fast as the earnings from
the plants will permit.

SCHOOLS.

The School Department the past year has been subjected to
considerable criticism because of the retrenchment in expenditures which has been made by dropping certain of our supervisors.

Opinions differ as to the wisdom of the removal of all the supervisors, on the ground that the best opportunities are not thus
afforded the scholars for advancement.

The cost of our schools was the highest per pupil of any city
in the State except Newton and Springfield, showing that something was radically wrong in our expenditures in that department as compared with other cities in the State. The cost per

pupil based on average membership for the year was .

Fall River was ,
Chicopee ,
Lynn, ,
Lawrence,  ,

Haverhill,  ,

Springfield,  .

Most of these are manufacturing cities similarly situated in
many ways. There are many things our schools would receive
benefit from which we cannot afford if introduced, for the educational department is but one of the many in our city and we can- |
not extravagantly advance this at the expense of the others. In
all our departments our expenditures should be proportionate toour income. The School Committee should keep close watch
however to see that no curtailment of expenditure results in any
detriment to the education of the scholars. The expenditures.
this year have been decreased so that the cost per pupil was
$ Any attempt to make political capital out of an honest
effort of the School Committee to do what in their judgment is.
for the best interests of the city is not to be commended. Our
School Department is not managed with the idea of furnishing
positions for any one, but solely for the best interests of the pupils..

We have an efficient corps of teachers who are working
faithfully under the earnest direction of Mr. L. P. Nash for the .
welfare of our schools. The school accommodations in Ward
  are inadequate and this year they should be remedied as it
seems to me they can be at no great expense, by an addition to.

one principal can look after two schools without any detriment
to the department. Other cities have tried the plan successfully.

MAYOR'S ADDRESS. iY
| POLICE DEPARTMENT.

The criticism of the Police Department this past year has
been less than for several years. Practically all of it directed
still against the enforcement of laws relating to the sale of intoxicating liquors. The number of licenses granted to hotels has
been decreased and the result seems to me an improvement.
There is still room for better observance of the law by those
who receive licenses. The License Commissioners should more

| frequently inspect the places where licenses are held and maintain closer supervision of the manner in which these places are
conducted. There has been more harmony in the ranks of the
members of the Police Department than formerly, which naturally results in greater efficiency. Our competent City Marshal
and his assistants have attended carefully to the duties of the
department. The difficulties of their position however are little
appreciated by the average citizen, who while ever ready to criticise neglects to commend. The public believe in an enforce- ment of the existing laws and proper observance of the Sabbath,
and it should be the aim of the Police Department and [License .
Commissioners to see that this is brought about. Where violation of the law is found the license.should be at once revoked.
The result will prove beneficial.
FIRE DEPARTMENT. |

The Fire Department has kept to its high standard of ef.ficiency. Ina loss of only  worth of property, there
was net loss of  to the owners after insurance losses
were adjusted.

The permanent force has been on trial during the past year
and has proven satisfactory. Its efficiency was especially tried
in the fire in the Marble Block, where it is safe to say the loss
would have been greater had the former system been in vogue. .
A strong effort was made during this year to sell the High
Street Engine House, but the difference between the price we
could obtain and the cost of new house made the change at
the present time seem inadvisable. For several years past there

  MAYOR'S ADDRESS. |
has been reasonable request from the older members of the
department for an increase in their pay. It seems to me that a
system graded on the length of service in the Department would
be acceptable to the men and should be adopted. would
recommend that the Fire Commissioners adopt such plan if
their appropriation will permit. The Fire Commissioners make
several recommendations in their annual report which are worthy
of consideration.
BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.
The Board of Public Works makes its usual good showing.
. The improvements made under its direction have all been for
the advantage of our city. Two additional Bath Houses have
been constructed, making four now owned by the city and more
than in any other city in the State outside of Boston.

During the season nearly persons have patronized
these for bathing purposes, or nearly persons per day
during July and August, showing that the public appreciate
them. new bridge has been constructed on Main street,
probably one of the strongest bridges in the State, and at cost
of but  one-half of which was borne by the Street Railway Company. The plans for this were made by our efficient
City Engineer and its construction was made possible by the
permission obtained from the Holyoke Water Power Company
to put extra supports in its canal. It has been surprise to
engineers that an iron bridge with brick pavement could be constructed at such minimum cost. J)wight street has been
paved with bituminous macadam and with vitrified brick, Lyman
street and Cabot street paved and the streets throughout the city
kept in good condition.

BOARD OF HEALTH.

The members of this Department have been compelled to
face most trying situation. Small-pox visited us and had it not
been for the vigilance and efficiency of the members of the
Board we would have suffered more severely. They have
worked hard and faithfully and merit the commendation of all
citizens for their watchfulness.

MAYOR’S ADDRESS. |
WATER DEPARTMENT. a

The plan of paying the Water Department for all water
used by different Departments was tried this year for the first
time and the Departments paid but the Water Department has turned over to the Sinking Fund Commissioners
$  under special act of the Legislature as its share to wards the payment of our city debt. While the balance thus 
seems to be against the Water Department, understand the
wasting of the water used by the city departments has been cut
down so that the consumption is only about per cent of what
it formerly was. This would make the commercial value about
balance. The Water Department pays at the same rate now on
its construction account of  as the tax payers of the

. city. The high service system has been advanced and should be
| finished by another season.
PARK DEPARTMENT.

The report of the Park Department has been very carefully
drawn and contains an itemized account of the expenditures so
that the public can see that the appropriation has been wisely
, expended. In city with as many working people as we have
' the Park Board should be one of our most important ones.
Until the present chairman, Charles E. Mackintosh, was appointed no especial attention was given to this department.
With the co-operation of most of the other members, however,
the plans for bringing our Parks up to date are being pushed as

 rapidly as their limited appropriation will permit. It is matter
worthy of consideration that while we should have acres
devoted to park purposes we have only acres. It is alsoa
singular fact that we have only purchased one park (Canonchet),
the others having been donated to us so that the tax payers
should not complain if we should borrow money for the purchase
of additional park areas. Elmwood Park should be developed
before the land in that section becomes too valuable; in fact,
land desirable for park purposes can probably never be purchased
‘any cheaper than at the present time. The recommendation of

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS. ,
our Park Commissioners should be given careful consideration.
The public appreciate the present policy of advancement and I
trust we can deal more generously with this department during.
the coming year.
CITY ENGINEER’S DEPARTMENT.

The city has received excellent service from this department
during the past year. The Main Street bridge was planned and
constructed under the direction of Mr. J. L. Tighe, our City
Engineer. His services during his term of office have been of
great value to the city. believe he has solved the problem of
bridges for Holyoke with strong structure at minimum cost.

This is quite an important matter for us for our eighteen bridges
if put together would be nearly three-quarters of mile in length.
The detail work of this department has been well cared for and .
is evident to all who have watched our improvements during the
past few years. The plans for an addition to the Sargeant Street
building are about ready to be submitted to the School Committee for their approval. The new Sewer system for the High- :
lands should be started during the coming year.

OVERSEERS OF THE POOR.

The report from this department reflects credit on its conduct. To take care of the poor of our city in proper manner
and ata minimum expense deserves commendation. An expense
of cents per capita is exdingly low as compared with other
cities of the state. This department cost last year a
decrease from the preceding year. The good results have been
accomplished through the diligence of our competent City
Almoner, Mr. J. T. Cunningham, working in co-operation with .
the members of this department.

LEGAL DEPARTMENT.

Our able City Solicitor, N. P. Avery Esq., has looked after
the litigation of the city in his usual careful manner. Many cases
have been disposed of, the two principal ones being the Municipal:

MAYOR’S ADDRESS.  
Lighting case which has been referred to at length elsewhere, and |
the case of M. E. Cummings for work on the High School. It is
a relief to all our citizens to have those two cases closed. The
Lyman Mills case should be finally finished as soon as possible as
that has been pending long time. wish some satisfactory
arrangement might be made with Thomas W. Mann which would
be equitable to both parties. The Solicitor deserves commendation for the faithful performance of his duties. |

IN CONCLUSION.

I am grateful to the people of Holyoke for their continual
confidence. There has been harmony in all the departments during the past year and it isonly through the co-operation of all the
officials and their faithful work that the good results have been
attained. believe Holyoke stands today well in the lead of the
cities of this Commonwealth. While the debt of most cities has
been increased, ours has been decreased, yet improvements have
been made and progress along all lines. The best interests of all
the people have been subserved. ,

, D. W. KENNEY, :

a
We regret to announce the loss by death of our fellow
Commissioner, Mr. Maurice Lynch, who died on January  .
Mr. Lynch was man of sturdy character, and his large business
experience and his knowledge of the department through
previous membership on the Board fitted him for valuable
service to the city.
a
The past year has been one of considerable activity in the
department. The principal work undertaken was that of cleaning up the basin of High Service Reservoir, work on which was
commenced few years ago, and good progress was made despite
the unusually wet season, which of necessity retarded the work
to some extent. |
It was the intention of the Board to build part of the
masonry core-wall of the dam this year, and plans and specifica  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.
tions were prepared, bids asked for and the contract awarded,
 but the contractor declining to execute the contract it was
decided to postpone the work till the following year, when it is
hoped to build part if not all of it. The foundations were ,
stripped, however, and the advice of expert engineers, acting in
conjunction with our own efficient City Engineer, obtained as to |
the security of the natural foundations. They also examined
and approved the plans and specifications prepared by the
City Engineer.
A leakage in the dam of Whiting Street Reservoir, at the
‘lower end, was discovered in the early part of the year, but the
trouble was remedied by filling in with gravel on the inside of
the wall. The work was expensive, however, on account of the
extremely cold weather making it hard to procure the gravel.

The  -inch main pipe in Dwight street, which ended at
the second level canal bridge, was extended across the canal and
connected with the  -inch main in Race street, resulting in much
benefit to the pressure in that vicinity.

An  -inch main was laid in Taylor street from the intersection of Hampden to the north end of the street, replacing the

)  -inch main. Two new  -inch two-way steamer hydrants were
installed on this new main, thereby adding considerably to the
 fire protection as well as more adequate water supply for that
neighborhood. This is along the line of the work mapped out,

that of replacing the small cast-iron mains with larger ones.

A much needed and long desired improvement has been accomplished in the raising of the railroad track three feet, for a
distance of about feet, at Ashley Ponds. It was gradual
rise, covering distance of feet altogether. This was

 made necessary because of the water overflowing onto the track
at certain seasons of the year. The work was done by the railREPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
road people, but the department paid for the doing of it. The
work was well done. The matter had hung fire for some time,
the railroad officials not. caring to increase the grade at this, the
highest point on their road to Westfield. ,

Something has been accomplished in the buying up of the
remaining land on the immediate water-sheds of Wright Pond
and High Service reservoir, and more of. it will be bought on
these and the water-shed of Whiting Street reservoir the coming
year, as arrangements have already been made for its purchase.
With these purchases completed, the city will be in possession
of nearly all the land on the immediate water-sheds of its

: reservoirs.

The Shoals damage case, one of the cases in connection
with the taking of the southwegt branch of the Manhan River
was settled in June, and the Abbey case, for land taken at High
Service reservoir, was settled by the purchase of the land in
December. |

The work of enlarging the office and vault has been commenced. The Board of Public Works has kindly assigned to us
the little room opening off of our present oftice, and when it is
fitted up it will greatly add to the convenience of our quarters.

In the early spring there was much complaint about the
disagreeable taste and odor of the water, especially that of
Ashley Ponds, and though every measure was taken to remedy
the trouble it seemed to have no effect. The hydrants were
opened and the mains flushed out at intervals both in the daytime and at night, as it was at first thought the trouble was in
the pipes. We afterwards found that the trouble originated at
the ponds, and though the flushing seemed to have little or no
effect for time, yet by persisting in it we believe the time of
the unpleasantness of the water was shortened. The State Board

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.
of Health was requested by us to come to Holyoke and make an
examination of the water to determine the cause of the bad odor
and taste, and to allay any fears the people might have as to the
healthfulness of it. They found the trouble to be due to an
organism known as uroglena, and which is not known to be
injurious to the public health. Small organisms are found in a
great many of the larger domestic water supplies of the country,
, causing disagreeable tastes and odors at certain periods of the
year. What causes them to appear is an unsolved problem.
The trouble disappeared after short time.

There has been an abundance of water the past year and,
barring the time referred to, it has been of excellent quality.

The value of the new  -inch main was well illustrated at
the Marble Block fire December  when the pressure on High
street was only reduced about five pounds with thirteen streams,
six of which were pumped from the hydrants by steamers,
playing on the fire at one time. ,

The scheme inaugurated by the Special Act of  ,
whereby the city pays for the water used in all of its departments, has had tendency to curtail the waste in the city
departments, especially the schools, all previous efforts in this—
direction having failed of effect.

The receipts from the city for water amounted to ,
which is little less than half the amount paid by this department to the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund of the city
for taxes.

The receipts from water rents were  more than
those of the previous year, and deducting the amount received 
from the city, leaves the receipts from this source  more
than last year.

The number of new services put in this year was consideraREPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
bly less than for the year before, owing to the small number of
new buildings erected during the year.

It is the intention of the Board to continue the work at
High Service Reservoir this coming year, doing as much as the
finances of the department will warrant: in’ addition to looking
| after the needs of the city proper. .
- It is the intention also to make further study in regard to
the tastes and odors of the water with view to better understanding of the matter. |

REPORT OF ,
FIRE COMMISSIONERS.
OFFICE OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS,
HoryokE, Mass., Dec. .
To the Honorable Mayor and City Council: .

GENTLEMEN :—In compliance with the requirements of the
City Ordinance your Board of Fire Commissioners present their
report for the year ending December .

The Board organized January by the election of
Charles L. Newcomb as chairman, Daniel Proulx as vice-chairman and John Hildreth as Secretary. Your Commissioners
have held twenty-four formal meetings, and many informal
meetings during the past year.

There have been fires and alarms during the past year
with the total damage to buildings and contents of Of
this amount  was paid by insurance companies leaving |
a net loss to our citizens of more detailed account .
of the fires and losses will be found under the head of fires
and alarms. ;

On January Ist, we re-organized the fire department, changing it from call to permanent department We have been
gradually bringing about this change for number of years, and
a careful examination of the work done by the department will
we think, justify the change. total fire loss of only 
for the year speaks volumes for the efficient work done by our
firemen. Under our new system we are enabled to get sufficient
number of trained permanent men to every fire within few
minutes, to control it, unless it is very large fire.

 REPORT OF FIRE. COMMISSIONERS.
When you see the Dispatch. wagon with its nine alert and
- skillful. firemen speeding to fire give them the right of way
and do not.stand and criticise. Remember that their mission may
be one of life or death, and ‘that the delay of few seconds may
. result in the loss of precious human life and thousands of dollars
worth of property. .We regret to say that there have been three
. deaths resulting from. fire: during the past year, viz.:—Mary
Duke, Cora Fortin and Mrs. William Spring. Two of these
. persons lost their: lives by fires which were caused by children
playing with matches, and the other through the careless use of
gasolene. There were. four. other cases where persons were
seriously burned, but fortunately they did not lose their lives.
Three of these fires were.caused by the careless use of gasolene.
As usual, we have had many fires resulting from the careless
 handling of matches, gasolene and kerosene lamps, and we urge
upon our citizens the necessity of using greater care in the handling of these useful, but dangerous commodities.

Six of our firemen have received serious injuries during the

. past year, but fortunately none of them resulted fatally. The
names of the injured men were as follows, viz.:—J. J. Callahan,
Frank N. Bligh, Louis LaBrecque, P. T. Kennedy, F. Donoghue
and M. Bowler. During the year there have been some firemen
on duty all day at the telephone and we have found this to be a
great advantage, especially. when still alarm is called in, of
which .we have had forty-six during the past year, when few
moments delay in getting word to the department might possibly
result in very serious loss.

The Commissioners congratulate our citizens upon the very
successful year we have had from fire department stand-point.
The change from call force to permanent force and the distri.. bution of the.men has been very well done under the efficient
management of our Chief, and we cannot speak too highly of the

- courage and zeal displayed by both officers and men in the

pursuit of their dangerous and arduous duties. |
.We thank the Honorable Mayor and Board of Aldermen for
their generous treatment of the department, and we have tried

.- to: wisely expend the money appropriated in the best possible

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.  d
manner, and we make the following recommendations and trust
that you will give them that consideration which they deserve.

First. We again recommend that new engine house be
erected to replace House No.  on High street. During the past
year your Honorable Board gave the Commissioners and Board
of Public Works authority to obtain options on lots for new
engine house, and report back to the Board of Aldermen.
Options were obtained and report was made to the Board of
Aldermen but no action was taken. We earnestly recommend

' that steps be taken early this year to purchase lot. The importance of this cannot be too strongly stated.

Second. We again report our recommendations of the last
two years that House No.  should be enlarged in accordance
with the plans of our City Engineer, and that the extension
should be placed on the west side. This house is altogether too
crowded, there is neither room enough for the apparatus or |
horses that are kept there. .

Third. House No. is very poorly adapted for an engine
house and again we recommend that this house be sold and a
new modern fire engine house be erected nearer the center of
the ward. This ward is building up so rapidly that it soon will
be impossible to obtain desirable location.

Fourth. Engine No. has been in active service for over
sixteen years and needs to be overhauled and anew boiler put
on, and we would recommend that it be equipped with new
Fox boiler, which will make it an up-to-date machine.

Fifth. We sincerely trust that the Board of Water Commissioners will continue to improve the high level service as the
pressure is not yet what it should be on the Highlands and at
Elmwood. This is serious matter and deserves the best consideration of the Water Commissioners. —

Siath. Werecommend that new ten circuit repeater be
put inthe fire alarm department in the near future, as we have
out-grown the present repeater and it is dangerous to continue
to use it much longer.

Seventh. We recommend that there be an increased appropriation for salaries to enable your Fire Commissioners to increase

 REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.
the salaries of our firemen, and we trust that you will give this
matter your careful attention.

HORSES.

We have thirty-nine horses in the department, and while

the horses are in very good condition our experience has shown

' that number of them may be disabled in very short time.
We have been obliged to purchase nine horses during the past
year, and this branch of our department continues to be very
expensive, and we are hoping that the time is drawing near when
some form of horseless carriage can be used to advantage in
the fire department, but as yet we have not been able to find

 anything that meets the requirements of this service.

| HAY AND FEED. ,

We have the usual quantity of hay, feed and bedding on

hand. .
HOUSES.

The engine houses, on the whole, are in very good state of
repair. We have suggested various changes and improvements
that are necessary in our recommendations, to which we earnestly
call attention. |

APPARATUS.

The apparatus is generally in good condition, with the exception of steamer No.  This steamer has been in active
service for sixteen years, and it will be necessary to put new
boiler on this steamer, and we recommend that new Fox Boiler
be put on the steamer during the coming year. We have
purchased new wagon for Despatch Company No.  as the
wagon that has been in use the past year is not adapted to the

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS. 
very severe demands now made upon it, as this piece of apparatus responds to every alarm, and has to carry nine men
and considerable hose, so that it requires wagon bnilt specially
for this kind of work. The apparatus now in active service
consists of six steam fire engines, two double tank chemical
engines, one combination hose and chemical wagon, six twohorse hose wagons, one aerial truck, two hook and ladder trucks,
five exercise and supply wagons, one chief’s buggy, one superintendent of fire alarm wagon, three sleighs, and one automobile.

HOSE.

We have purchased during the past year feet of new
hose. For the last few years we have been buying higher
grade of hose than heretofore and our experience has been that
in the long run it is more profitable to buy good grade of hose
rather than cheap grade. We have in the department the

- following hose, viz:—

FIRE ALARM TELEGRAPH.

, In the near future it will be advisable to put the wires in
the thickly settled portions of our City under ground. This will
entail considerable expense, but the safety of the City will
necessitate this being done. The liability to damage to the over-.
head system is too great to be continued longer than is absolutely
necessary, and very much of the success of the fire department
depends upon the efficient working of our fire alarm system, and
we cannot speak too highly of the experience of the superintendent in maintaining this system at its present high state of
efficiency. We have put in three new fire alarm boxes during
the past year, viz:—Box No.  Fairfield avenue; Box No.  ,
corner of North Pleasant and Harvard streets and Box No.  ,
in the car sheds of the Holyoke Street Railway. There is in
this department the following property, viz:—

Strong current protector board, 
Storage battery,

REPORT OF THE )
SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
To his Honor the Mayor, and the Citizens of Holyoke:

The School Committee respectfully submit their annual report for the year nineteen hundred two.

The school department has been carried on ‘during the year
with harmony and in good order, and the Committee feel that the
year has been successful one. Our public schools cost a
great deal of money, and as the city grows, the cost must
be expected to increase. The School Committee ought therefore to practice the most careful economy; every dollar of. |
the people’s money ought to bring its full return. At
the same time, we cannot afford to be niggardly, but must
practice reasonable liberality, in proportion as the interests
concerned are important and vital. The public school is the
most precious possession of the people; the money for schoois is
always willingly voted, and we ‘are sure that no public expendi- .
ture is more useful than the expenditure for schools.

The school system of Holyoke has been comparatively more
expensive than systems in other cities. “Owing to variety of
causes, the school department had been so organized as to carry
up the cost to high figure. When the people discovered that
there was only one city in the state of Massachusetts where the
cost per capita for educating the children was as high as in
Holyoke, there was sharp criticism of the conduct of the schools.
Here was state of things which the School Committee were
obliged to consider. Jn the long run, all this expense has to be
borne by the people who produce wealth. In the interest of all
our people therefore, it became the duty of the Committee to re  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

duce the per capita expense. For several years past very careful consideration has been given to this matter, gradual and considerate changes have been made, and expense has been materially
reduced, while the standard of work has been maintained. It
would not do to make sweeping changes; the interests of the
schools are so large and so complicated and so far-reaching that
the most careful and deliberate consideration must be given before any changes are made.

The reports issued by the Committee show the expenditures
in detail, and they show that expenditure per capita has been
materially reduced. For the fiscal year  the total
expenditure by the School Committee was of this
$  was expended for furniture for new buildings, leaving
$  for the support of the schools. For the fiscal year
 the Committee has looked very closely after expenditure, especially in the matter of school supplies, with the
gratifying result that the total expenditure was or a
saving of while at the same time the average membership of the schools was increased by pupils. This means
a saving of taxes for every person who lives in Holyoke.

Great pressure has been brought to bear upon the Committee
to still further reduce expenditure. It has been urged that salaries should be reduced; but no great saving could be made unless there were general reduction of all salaries, and this your
Committee are unwilling to vote. Our teachers do great deal
of ‘hard work, and salaries are none too high as they are. After
long and careful consideration, we voted to try the experiment
of dispensing with the services of supervisors, or special teachers, in drawing, writing, music and calisthenics. The plan of :
having supervisors to teach these special subjects is one that has

 been introduced with other improvements in school work within
recent years. There are many highly successful systems of
scbools where no supervisors are employed. Almost all of our
teachers have been trained to teach these subjects, as well as the
other subjects usually taught; if any teacher is peculiarly unfitted, as perhaps in the case of teacher who cannot sing and
cannot therefore teach music well, it is possible to change with

REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
, other teachers in the building, so that some well-qualified teacher
may take the class for that particular work. The members of
the Committee are keeping close and careful watch of the school —
work in these particulars; if it appears that the classes are
. suffering any considerable detriment, then supervisors may be.
engaged.
Attention was called in the last annual report to crowded —
buildings and the use of unsuitable rooms at South Holyoke.
We understood that new building was to be erected, but
nothing has been done. If arrangements could be made to
send pupils from South Holyoke to the empty rooms in Ward
One we should be glad to do that, but such plan seems hardly
feasible. We therefore urge that new building be provided in
South Holyoke. The Elm Street building is overcrowded, and
we renew the recommendation of year ago that new building
be provided for the offices and supply rooms, so that the whole
of the Elm Street building may be taken for school rooms.
, Respectfully submitted,
, WILLIAM REARDON,
GEORGE P. ELLISON,
| DENNIS F. CLEARY.

REPORT OF THE
First District Committee.
The first district includes the schools at West Holyoke,
Highlands, Nonotuck street, School street, North Chestnut street
and Elm street. There were enrolled for the last school year
  pupils and teachers. ;
The buildings of the district are in good condition. The
North Chestnut street building has always been an expensive
building to maintain. radical rearrangement or wholly new
building would be the remedy. At Elm street the rooms are
overcrowded and the offices of the School Department must be
removed or additional room must be found in some other way.
We recommend that steps be taken at once to remove the
offices so that the whole of the Elm street building may be made
available for school rooms. At School street new furnace is
needed.
Respectfully submitted,
THOMAS J. LYNCH,
M. H. WHITCOMB,
GEORGE H. SMITH. |

REPORT OF THE
Second District Committee. —

The buildings of the second district are in good condition,
except for the long-standing need of larger and better sanitaries
at South Chestnut street, Appleton street and Sargeant street.
This matter has been discussed repeatedly. The Board of Public Works recognize the need, but their appropriation is strictly
limited and they cannot make the improvements unless specific
appropriation is made by the Board of Aldermen for that pur; pose. We therefore recommend that the School Committee
adopt resolutions setting forth the need of new sanitaries at Appleton street, Sargeant street and South Chestnut street, stating
the probable cost, and requesting the Board of Aldermen to make
an appropriation to put the buildings into proper shape. At

} Elmwood, we understand that drinking fountains are to be supplied, and also rear door opening out upon the play ground.

The region which sends pupils to the North Chestnut street,
Elm street, Appleton street and South Chestnut street schools is
being rapidly built up with apartment houses. The buildings are
already crowded; at South Chestnut street we have two classes
in attic rooms, where the light is poor, and some other classes are
so crowded that we have been obliged to provide an assistant

| teacher. It is evident that new school building will soon be
demanded for that part of the city.

There have been no changes among principals and but few
among teachers in the second district during the past vear. The
work has gone on in general smoothly and successfully.

Respectfully submitted,
GEORGE P. ELLISON,
DENNIS F. CLEARY,
WILLIAM REARDON.

' REPORT OF THE |
Third District Committee.

The third district includes the schools ‘at Lyman street,
Bridge street, Dwight street, West street, Park street, Hamilton
street. It has enrolled during the past year teachers,  
pupils.

The Lyman street building is now rented for parochial
school, under charge of Rev..D. F. McGrath. The opening of
this school took so many pupils from the public schools that

. three rooms in the Dwight street building and two at West
street have been closed. There is now large building in process of erection for the parochial school; when this building
shall be opened, we shall doubtless recommend the closing
temporarily of several more rooms in that neighborhood.

The buildings at South Holyoke are unduly crowded, and
if it were practicable to send pupils from Ward Two to the schools in Ward One we should certainly recommend such a
course. But so far as we have tried that plan it was not success. We therefore asked last year for new building in Ward
Two. The Board of Aldermen directed that plans should be
prepared for such building, but apparently it has not been

| thought fit to obey this order.of our Aldermen. As result, we
have children attending school in hall where light is insufficient; we have some ina hired room, and many are in rooms |
that are too erowded. This makes our work more costly than it
ought to be, and not so successful as it ought to be: the blame
for this state of affairs does not rest upon the School Committee.

There is no piano at either the Bridge street or Park street
building. We recommend that pianos be bought for these

. buildings. At West street there should be provided five hundred seats for the hall.

Respectfully submitted,
O. Z. E. CHAREST,
R. T. PRENTISS,
EDWARD F. CARY.

REPORT OF THE ,
Evening School Committee.
The evening schools have been carried on upon the same
lines as previously. There were enrolled pupils, with an
average membership of  and the total cost for teachers’ salaries, supplies and janitor service, was The expense
per capita was therefore .

The law requires that evening schools shall be maintained
for those who do not attend day school. It has however been permitted in few special cases that pupils who attend day school
have also been allowed to enter the ®vening schools. It appears

 that this practice should be carefully guarded, and should be per- *
mitted only in cases where there is sufficient reason. The number of persons who cannot read and write the English language
is decreasing in Holyoke, and the elementary evening schools may
be expected to become smaller. But there is large and increasing number. of people who have some slight scholastic attainments and have ambition enough to want to get more. To encourage these people, classes are formed at all the evening schools,
in which the studies are carried on to degree of advancement
corresponding to the sixth grade or further. Then there is the
evening grammar school, in which it is the desire and aim of your
Committee to teach any subjects that may reasonably be demanded. In connection with the evening grammar school there
have been arranged certain lectures of general interest, and these
have been found very popular and valuable. Under Massachusetts law, we shall be obliged to organize an evening high school
as soon as the population of the city shall exd fifty thousand.

Respectfully submitted,

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON
/
Manual Training and
Kindergartens.

At the High school, the department of Manual Training is
growing, and may be expected to continue to increase. It is essential that some: help should be given, since there is not time
enough for single teacher to do all the work. For the present, it would be expedient to appoint teacher for the mechanical drawing and to assist in manual training, thus relieving Mr.
McDonald to that extent. We further recommend that boys of
the ninth grade take lessonsin wood working once week at the
High school building; girlg,should have work in sewing for a
corresponding time.

We have now seven kindergartens, located at the Highlands, North Chestnut street, Elm street, Elmwood, East Dwight
street, Hamilton street, Springdale. There were enrolled last
year pupils and teachers. The average membership of
pupils was  the total expense of teaching and supplies, ,
$ the average expense for teaching and supplies was
$  per pupil ,and the cost for teaching alone,  per pupil.
The cost for teaching per pupil in the first primary grade was
$ It therefore has cost nearly twice as much to give a
half day’s teaching in kindergarten as whole day in the first
grade.

The attendance at the East Dwight street kindergarten has
been very irregular; at times the number of children has not
warranted the employment of two teachers; the sub-committee
have kept closely in touch with the course of affairs and have
tried to manage the matter in the wisest way. |

Your Committee have endeavored to look after the purchases and to see that the money of the city is faithfully and
economically expended. The purchase of supplies for the school
buildings has been carried on by the same plan of bidding that
has hitherto been used for the purchase of educational supplies.
This has no doubt saved quite little money. We call attention to the fact that although the number of children in school
is larger, the expenditures in the three departments of text
books, educational supplies and building supplies are smaller
than in the preceding year. By examining the table of supplies
for the different buildings it will be seen that there is very great |
difference. It seems reasonable to ask how it should happen that
the use of books and supplies is so much larger in proportion to
the number of children in some buildings than in others, and this
. matter should be inquired into during the coming year. ,

Our school system continues to grow in accordance with
the growth of the city. There are more than ten thousand
children of school age in Holyoke and more than seven thousand
enrolled in the public schools. By reference to the figures it
will be seen that the per capita expense for several years past has
been steadily reduced. For the fiscal year of  it cost
  to educate each child. For the year it cost
 The school committee have the right to claim therefore, that they have been careful and economical with the money
of the people, and have deserved the confidence and support
which they have always received.

As our school population has increased, so the school department has been expanded to meet the need. In many of the
larger cities of the country, such reasonable advancement has not
been kept up; in some cities there are not school buildings
enough, and hundreds of children are crowded out of school for
sheer lack of room. It is earnestly to be hoped that our city will
so maintain energy and public spirit and interest in the schools
that such condition may never obtain here. Several school
buildings have been erected in recent years, which are an honor
to the city; others will have to be provided soon. The first need

: is at South Holyoke. The rooms are crowded and we have one
class in hall and one in hired room where formerly bottling
was carried on. In both of these places the light is poor; and in
the years of the future, these children will probably suffer the effects
of the injurious treatment to which they are now subjected. It
would seem to be plain duty, hardly open to discussion, that the
city should provide such accommodations for its school children
that their eyes may not be injured. The district near the Elm

REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
street school is being built up rapidly with large apartment houses,
and some relief, by providing new school rooms, or by hiring rooms,
must be had very soon. We have already more pupils in most
of the rooms of that building than ought to be there, and we
cannot possibly take many more.

There is one change in school organization which might be
‘ made, and which would affect the demand for more buildings.
All pupils of the first grade might be admitted to school for half
day only. Three hours day of school work according to our
present plan is enough for the majority of first-grade children.
If the enrolment for room were kept below thirty, there would
be great saving in the strain upon the teacher’s nerves. No
doubt it would be easier for teacher to take twenty-five pupils
from nine to twelve, and twenty-five different pupils from half |
past one till half past three, than to take the numbers that our |
teachers now have for the present hours of duty. Of course
there are some objections to such plan, as there are to any plan.
The children would not bave been taken care of by the school for
so many hours of the day as they now are, relieving the mothers and keeping the children off the street both forenoon and afternoon. Also those pupils who were forced to attend in the afternoon would not be as well off as those who had the morning
session. It would be necessary to change about, every two or
three months. But as the size of classes would be diminished,
each pupil would receive more immediate attention from the
teacher. The children would work more intensively for shorter
day; this is in accordance with modern ideas about methods of
work. Ky this plan, the same number of school rooms could be
made to accommodate larger number of children. The plan is
now in operation in many places. It has been tried in some of
the schools of Springfield, it is used throughout the primary
grades of Syracuse, and it has been approved wherever it bas been ,
tried.
HEALTH OF PUPILS.
Our newer school houses are well ventilated, sufticiently
| lighted, and in most respects satisfactory. Some of the older

  '. BEPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
ones are very faulty, and attention has been repeatedly called to
evils and defects. Sanitary accommodations at Appleton street
and South Chestnut street are insufficient and dangerous to health.
At Park street there is only one entrance, and if it should be
blocked up by fire, do not see how pupils and teachers could
escape. There are other needs perhaps less pressing than these,
but still important.

Every part of the administration of the school system ought
to be such as will contribute in the most positive manner to maintain and improve the health of pupils. In some cities there is a
medical inspector, whose duty it is to visit schools regularly and
look out for the health of the pupils. Hesoon detects cases of contagious disease, he is on the lookout for faulty ventilation or de, fective plumbing, and his services are no doubt of great value.

In the absence of such an officer it becomes the duty of our principals and teachers to look out for these matters all the more
carefully. school building should be kept scrupulously clean.
Fresh air and sunshine should be abundant, cheerfulness and
good nature and healthy, wholesome ways should be the rule of
school life. There should be singing and calisthenic exercises, |
and the recesses in the open air should be cultivated. There is a
growing tendency to do away with the recess. Now it must be
admitted that the recess is good deal of trouble and “bother”
to the teacher, but it is the precise business of the teacher to take
whatever trouble may be necessary for the good of the children.
The out-of-door recess, with little vigorous exercise in the open
air, is what children need. Some teachers have claimed that
- gymnastic exercises in the school room might do as well, but this 
is far from being the fact. After diligent study, sitting in ‘en- |
forced quiet, with attention and will-power strained to observe
certain rules of conduct, the children need to throw off restraint
and give some rest to the powers of will and attention. Gymnastic exercises, if they are worth anything, demand still closer
attention than study. Play is movement according to impulse,
in the direction of least resistance; and it is free play that our
children need after prolonged exercise of attention and selfrestraint. The open air recess ought therefore to be encouraged.

REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
Another duty of the teacher is, to look out for any children
' whose mental powers or whose senses may be defective. There
are great many children who suffer severely because they are
slightly deaf, or near-sighted, or have some other defect. These
failings are rarely discovered at home. It therefore becomes the —
duty of the teacher to be on the watch, and when such defects ‘
are discovered, to take such measures that the child may suffer
as little as possible. In some cities all pupils are regularly examined by competent physicians, that such failings may be
detected and proper care taken. |
SUPERVISORS.

Until this year we have had supervisors or special teachers
in our schools, to take charge of the subjects of penmanship,
music, drawing and calisthenics. It is customary among cities of
the rank of Holyoke and even much smaller, to have supervisors
in some at least of these subjects. These supervisors were of

' great assistance to the teachers, and contributed much to increase
the excellence of our work in their respective departments.
However, it was voted by the Committee that as measure of
economy the services of these supervisors should be discontinued. As teachers, we have only of course to accept the
action of the School Committee, and do the best we can. The
experiment has hardly continued long enough for the exhibition

of results upon which any valuable opinions could be formed,
and any expression of opinion should be considered as tentative.

The teachers have gone loyally about the work in these subjects,
striving to keep up the standard as far as possible. Most of
them have had some training in these subjects, they have
profited by the instructions of the supervisors in former years,and
they have been so far substanially carrying along the plans of
work which the supervisors had set in operation. It appears to
me that our teachers are to be commended for the willingness
and the spirit which they have shown in this matter. It is
because of their faithful efforts that the falling off in the work in
these subjects is no greater than yet appears.

  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
EVENING SCHOOLS.
The evening schools constitute most interesting and
important part of our school system. There are first the
| elementary schools, whose office it is to teach to read and write
the English language. But there are great many lessons
taught that are not set down in the books. Coming together in
the evening school, and all studying together under the kindly
guidance of the teachers, there are lessons of pleasant and orderly
conduct, of respect and appreciation and ambition, that are of
immense value. Most of those who attend these schools are
immigrants from foreign countries, to whom the English language
is at first foreign tongue; and they learn here in the evening
school that co-operation and harmony of action which are so
necessary under our free government. They learn that they are
to be respected according as they earn respect by upright,
orderly, meritorious conduct; and in the few years that bave
observed them, they have shown wonderful improvement. The
evening school is powerful agent in the helping of these people
who come here as strangers, to make useful, helpful, honorable
citizens of the Great Republic.
THE HIGH SCHOOL.

The High school under its efficient principal continues to
maintain and improve its creditable standing. It is my opinion
that the course in Manual Training ought to be considerably extended and improved. It is greatly to be regretted thatthe 
course in Domestic Science has been for the present discontinued. The tendency of the day in educational matters ie to vigorously extend school work in all kinds of manual training. A
progressive school system ought to be studying and planning and

carrying out new work in this direction. Such work is expensive, but it is the kind of work that wiil contribute most powerfully to the future usefulness and success of our young people.
A very large proportion of our graduates enter some higher institution, which gives gratifying evidence of the high ambitions of

REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
our people, and indicates degree of prosperity as well, that they
should be able to carry such financial burdens. The report of
the principal is given below.

-IN GENERAL.

The responsibility for the care and rearing and education of
children must always rest with the parents. It is the function of
the public or private school to do those things which may be
done better or more economically by gathering together in large
numbers, but the school ought not to and cannot supersede
parental control and responsibility. There seems to be growing
tendency to shift almost the whole burden upon the school. It
is proposed apparently to hold the schools entirely responsible
for physical health, for mental growth, for moral advancement.
Even the attendance of children at school seems to be too much
for many parents to look out for, and they are astonished when
our truant officers point out to them that they must be responsible for the attendance of their own children at school, and may
be fined if they neglect that duty. The tendency to place the
whole responsibility upon the schools is wrong. Our teachers
are working faithfully and are doing good work, but there is ,
needed more earnest sense of responsibility and more careful
oversight on the part of parents.

The public school is established to bring up an intelligent
and virtuous body of citizens. That high task has not been fully
accomplished as yet. There is much to be desired, in both intellectual and moral development, among the people of our country, ,
and probably the greater need is in the direction of moral
growth. Leaders of education ought to have it in mind as their
first concern, to so plan that education shall contribute to the
evolution of moral character. The personal character of the
teacher is the first consideration. Teachers must of course be
people of correct lives, but they ought also to be people who
have the power of inepiration and leadership, such as will be
potent for good in the lives of their pupils. We have many
appHcants for positions to teach in Holyoke; there ought to be |

  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE. |
some plan by which we should select those of finest, strongest
 character to teach in our schools. The second factor that makes
for higher type of education should be found in the school
studies. Courses of study ought to be so planned as to contribute to the development of intellectual ability and especially of
high character. Weneed series of disciplines to develop moral
power. mere negative goodness will not suffice. Society
needs men and women with cultivated power of will, with personal initiative, with energy to carry into action their ideas of
right. In the temperance reform, in the amelioration of social
conditions, in the better adjustment of the relations of capital
and labor, the need of the hour is not alone for intellectual
ability to see what is right, but for the unselfishness and high
determination to carry out our right ideas. Education in the
twentieth century must bend itself as never before to this
| supreme end of education—the development of high moral
character. .
| wish to commend the faithful and successful work of our
teachers, who do great deal more of hard work than the people generally are aware of; and to thank the members of the
School Committee for courtesy and support and helpfulness |
which have been unfailing. |
| Respectfully submitted,
| LOUIS P. NASH.

HIGH SCHOOL.
Mr. L. P. Nash, Superintendent of Schools. .

Dear Sir:—In response to your request for the annual
report of the Principal, the following is submitted.

The total registration at the end of November is smaller by
eight than last year. Both the Senior and Freshman classes are
smaller than those of year ago. The attendance for the year
has in it much encouragement, the average attendance, with a

smaller registration, being equal to that of last year. The record
for the first three months of this year is compared in the table
below, with the corresponding months of the three previous years.
Average Per cent ‘TardiAttendance. Attendance. ness.
September to November inclusive, ;
September to November inclusive,  
September to November inclusive,  
September to November inclusive,  
It will be seen from this table that there has been an
' increase since of nearly two per cent in attendance, while
the tardiness has decreased more than one-half. As the per
capita cost of maintaining the school is based upon the average
attendance, this increase in attendance tends to make the per
capita cost so much less. Teachers must be provided for the full
enrolment, and if the average attendance is low, which has been
the condition in the past, the cost of maintenance is correspondingly high. In this respect our school has suffered in the past in
comparison with schools whose average attendance is high. But
of greater and more real importance is the influence toward
better work and habits on the part of the pupils, resulting from
this closer application to work and recognition of duty in
regular attendance. .

  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
; ELECTIVE COURSE. The elective course as now outlined has been in operation
three years. Certain advantages and disadvantages have developed as expected, and show. clearly the natural trend of any
elective system. The result of the three’ years’ elections, however, only confirms our belief that the system is desirable, but
that electives must be carefully distributed through the four
years, and that pupils need some supervision in the election of
their individual courses. The system thus offers wide opportunity for meeting individual needs, while the most evident
dangers can be avoided by careful advice to the pupil in the

election of his subjects. That the pupils are actually independent of each other in the choice of courses, is shown by the
elections of the present senior and junior classes. Of ninety
pupils taking fourth year English, fifty-five have absolutely distinct courses. Of one hundred and twenty-nine taking third
year English, fifty-six have each course different from every
other pupil. The proportion of distinct courses in the second
| class is much smaller, as the number of electives is smaller.

While this variety of courses presumably meets the need of
individual pupils, it makes the building of program difficult

task, and also makes it impossible to distribute the pupils into
classes of uniform numbers. Some will necessarily be large,
some small. Thisis disadvantage. It is often necessary to
form classes of pupils of different grades. This, too, is disadvantage, particularly if pupils of the first or second years must be
in class with juniors or seniors. Naturally the system requires
a larger teaching force, finless there is an over-crowding of some
classes,  more Opportunities must be given for recitations in
each subject where there is such general conflict of subjects.
All these difficulties were foreseen in planning the course, and
do not come as disappointment or discouragement.

The most serious difficulty to meet is the tendency to regard
the elective system as an opportunity to try all possible subjects
in the hope evidently of finding some that are easy. Nearly a
third of the pupils request changes after the opening of the year.

REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
Our belief is that in order to check tendency to weakness and
vacillation of purpose, pupils should be held rigidly to course
that has been deliberately chosen with the advice and consent of
their parents, and in accordance with which the program has
been made, and work distributed among teachers. We believe
that when pupils know that they must do the elected work, they
will find way to overcome the difficulties they thought insurmountable. Our observation leads us to believe they are as likely
to fail in the new choice as in the original. There are, of course,
occasional changes that are manifestly necessary, and to which
the above remarks do not apply.
COLLEGE PUPILS.
The Holyoke High school sends an apparently increasing
number of pupils to college each year. In connection with these
college pupils, two criticisms are frequently made. It is sometimes inadvisedly said that we do not have the full certificate
privilege to the colleges. In reply: we can say that we have
whatever privilege of this nature is granted to any first-class
, high school. Not all our pupils, however, earn this privileye by
their work in the High school, and to such the certificate is not
given. Again, as the number entering college increases, the average ability of those entering decreases, as some manage to enter although with heavy conditions, but are not able to do the
college work and are obliged to withdraw. The responsibility
for their failure is sometimes unjustly placed on the preparatory
school. The simple fact is, many are striving to go to college
who are unable to meet the present college demands. The responsibility for this condition is partly the unjustifiable desire of
principals to send as large number as possible to college, and
partly the worthy ambition of parents to give their children a, college education if possible. But while the tendency remains, we
must expect that some of our pupils will fail. In this connection,
and in defense of our ability to give thorough preparation, we
cite the success of Peter Gow, of the class of  who took
both the Latin and Greek prizes at Yale for the best entrance
examination in those subjects.

  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
DECORATIONS.
The school appreciates the tinting of the corridors and rooms
of the first floor, and adds its wish to the well-known desire of 
your board that the work of tinting the remainder of the walls
may be done before the beginning of another school year. As
- evidence of their own desire for more attractive building, the
pupils have added, through their various organizations, several
pictures to our collection. From the Herald, we have received
“ Joan of Arc,” froma painting by Bastien Lepage also “William
II Prince, of Nassau,” from painting by Van Dyke, and Canterbury Cathedral”; from the Girls’ Cooking Class, “Scene in Venice”; from the Dramatic Club, bust: of Sophocles and bracket;
from the Club, “Swift and Stella,” photogravure; from the
Senior Class, “The Village Farm,” from painting by Constable;
from the School Chorus, “A Landscape,” from painting by Ranger, and the “Lichfield Cathedral.” In addition to these, Vera
Lawrence, class of  has presented the school picture of
“ Modern Athens;” George W. Reardon, of the class of  has
given the English department “John Alden and Priscilla;”
and large, beautiful photograph, “The Castle of San Angelo
and the Tiber” has been received from-the teachers and pupils of
the Appleton Street school.
RECOMMENDATIONS.

In conclusion we ask your consideration of the following
recommendations: The addition of five lathes, five benches, circular and band saw to the equipment of the Manual Training
room; the addition to our course of study of year’s work in
general science, toinclude term each of geology, astronomy, and
botany; provision for special teacher of music; the placing of
ground glass windows in the toilet rooms; the providing for
double windows for the type-writing room.

Respectfully submitted, .

GENTLEMEN :—We herewith submit to your Honorable Board
this report of your Truant Officers for the school year ending

that was taken during the months of September and October.
The Committee on Attendance, Census and Truancy, appointed
Mr. Thomas W. Gaynor and Mr. Joseph Curran, Special Truant
Officers during the time we were employed in taking ‘the Census.
These gentlemen performed the duties assigned them in very

CENSUS.

census of  At the same time we took the city’s population»
and found it to be  loss of over last year. We cannot understand how this should be so, as the school census shows
a gain of  and there should be proportionate gain in the
city’s growth.

The following tables show the school census by districts,
September Ist,  September Ist,  and May Ist,  ;

REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
TRUANCY.

Truancy has decreased somewhat over the preceding year,
as is seen in the table of truants and truancies. In  there were
  truants with truancies, and this year truants with
  truancies, making twenty-one less truants and eighty-nine less
truancies than there was in  During the year there were
eight summonses served for truancy, one in February, one in
March, two in April, and four in May, five were committed to the
Truant school for one year, and three for two years. During the year twelve boys were discharged from the Hampden
County Truant school, and are doing well. We have now at the .
Truant school eleven boys. The most of them will be discharged during the coming year. From December to |
December we issued working certificates to minors
between the ages of fourteen and sixteen years, an increase of

. seventy-elght over last year.

REPORT OF THE
BOARD OF HEALTH.
To the Honorable the Mayor, and the Board of Aldermen.
GENTLEMEN :—In compliance with the Public Statutes, the
- Board of Health herewith respectfully submit for your consideration the twenty-second annual report. |
The Board met for organization on the first Monday of Feb- :
ruary electing the following officers: Chairman, Dr. Arthur B.
Wetherell; Secretary, Dr. Frank A. Woods; Health Officer, |
Mr. Jeremiah J. Linehan.
GENERAL WORK.
In the work of keeping the city in clean and sanitary condition the Board have proded in the same systematic manner
 as during the past few years. The result of this work is making
itself evident in the fact that during the past vear smaller number of dirty cellars and dirty tenements have been brought to our
attention, and it  with less trouble that we secure an abatement
of these nuisances and sources of filth. In this work the Board
has been aided by majority of the large property owners of the
city, who have readily acceded to our requests to attend to their
property in this respect.
‘ The usual number of small nuisances and complaints, affecting only the immediate locality in which they exist, have been
abated. There is still room for improvement in the matter of
waste papers found in large quantities on our public streets. This
may be remedied in part by closer attention to the permission given for the distribution of hand bills, and would also be

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
greatly improved if the City should provide receptacles for waste
papers upon the streets, as is done in so many cities.

The removal of old buildings in various parts of the city has
greatly improved the sanitary condition of the localities in which
they existed and has increased the value of surrounding properties.

Twenty-six such buildings have been removed during the
year. |

The Board is pleased to state that at present there are less

nuisances of this character in Holyoke than in most places.

The appended report of the Health Officer gives detailed
account of this work. —

BACTERIOLOGY.

The Board have continued the system of bacteriological
examinations in all cases of diphtheria and of throat trouble of a
suspicious nature. Dr. H. C. Emerson of Springfield was again
elected bacteriologist of the Board.

The Board would urge each physician to exercise due care
and promptness in taking swabs for diagnosis and also in tak ing the two consecutive negative swabs for release as caution
against the spread of contagion.

This system has apparently sucded very well during the
period it has been in operation, and the Board feel that it is of
the utmost importance that it be faithfully lived up to.

BAKERIES. ,

Such inspection of bakeries and their surroundings as is prescribed by law have been made. In majority of cases these
important places where so much of our food product is manufactured were found to be in good general condition.

Twenty-six bakeries are at present in operation in the city.
The Board still endeavors to use its influence against cellar
bakeries, and would advise legislation against the establishment
of the same. |

&
REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
UNDERTAKERS.

The usual licenses have been granted undertakers to carry
on this business, as required by law. Twelve licenses have been
granted during this year. The undertakers are prompt in filing
the certificates of death, and are careful in making their returns.

SLAUGHTER HOUSES.

All slaughter houses and manufacturers of sausage and prepared meat within the city have been granted licenses by this
Board. Nine licenses have been granted for the manufacture of
sausage and prepared meat, and two for slaughtering.

The supervision of these places of business has caused an
improvement in the character of the articles furnished to the

' public for consumption.
BARBER SHOPS.

As result of the many complaints concerning the sanitary
condition of number of the barber shops in the city, and the presence of more or less skin disease of contagious nature, the Board
have caused an inspection of these places of business and found that
some supervision of them was demanded. Accordingly, rules to
obtain satisfactory sanitary condition of the shops and greater
cleanliness in regard to the work done therein have been passed.
All the proprietors have been notified of this act, and copies of
the rules have been posted in all shops. —

There are at present barber shops in the city, in of
which it was found necessary to have material improvement
made.

FRUIT AND VEGETABLES.

The Board can report an improvement in the quality of the
fruit and vegetables that have been offered for sale in this city
during the past year.

There have been no prosecutions for selling decayed fruit
during the past twelve months.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
INSPECTOR OF MILK, VINEGAR AND PETROLEUM.

The duties of this office are still subdivided. The Board will
recommend tbat all the dutiess of this office be placed under the
supervision of the Board of Health, with fixed salary for the
Inspector, and proviso that all fees of the department revert to
the City Treasurer.

BARNS AND LIVERY STABLES.

Eleven applications have been received for the erection or
use of buildings as barns or livery stables. These have received
careful consideration. The locations have been inspected and
permits have been granted in all cases.

PLUMBERS. ,

The Board of Plumbing Examiners have examined all applicants referred to them by this Board.

There have been four applications made to the Board for
master plumber’s licenses, one for employing and six for journeyman plumber’s licenses.

Hight of the above applicants were granted licenses, and
three refused.

The report of the Plumbing Examiners is appended. SANITARY INSPECTION.

The Board can report that the work in this division of its
department has been carried on in thorough and satisfactory
manner.

The report of the Inspector of Plumbing shows that there
has been less new work done in the city during the past year
than in the preceding twelve months; however, the addition of
the unusual large amount of old work condemned and replaced,
together with the required tests, has necessitated large number
of inspections.

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  

A house-to-house inspection of plumbing is an urgent necessity, and the Board would again recommend that special appropriation be made and the work commenced early in the year.

Appended is the report of the Inspector of Plumbing.

VAULTS AND CESSPOOLS.

The Board has continued its endeavors to have all of the old
vaults and cesspools removed wherever the sewer privileges
would permit, and can now report that the city is practically
clear of the same in all sections having sewers.

' With comparatively little expense to the City, short sewers
with laterals could be laid, which would allow the Board to
abolish the majority of the remaining vaults.

SEWERS AND DRAINS.

The Walnut Street sewer is still nuisance and source of
filth, and its sewage should not be allowed to pass through the ,
canals. The Board would urge that this nuisance be abated in
the manner already suggested by the City Engineer.

The large amount of sewage discharged directly from the
mills into the canals in its course through the city is objectionable
from sanitary point of view, and public health demands that
some other disposal of this sewage should be made.

The Board would recommend that lateral sewers be laid on
Main Street, north and south from Berkshire Street; and that
some provision be made for the east side of North Summer
Street.

The condition of drainage of the houses at Ingleside should
receive serious consideration at once.

VITAL STATISTICS. 
The Board is pleased to report very material reduction in
| the number of deaths and also in the death-rate for the past
twelve months. :

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.

| For the year ending November there has been
reported deaths and still-births, death-rate of per
cent. per thousand inhabitants, while compared with deaths
and still-births, death-rate of per cent. per thousand
during  shows very satisfactory reduction of deaths
and per cent. per thousand in the death-rate. This points
to the fact that the past year has not only been considerably less
fatal than  but one of the most healthy in the records of this
Board. :

The appended “Table A” shows the comparative number of 
deaths, still-births and death-rates for the past ten years, to
  inclusive, the average number of deaths being  and the
average death-rate per cent.

“Table B” presents the number of deaths and still-births

occurring each month during the year, showing that the mortality
has been very even throughout the various months, being the

- greatest in July, when there were deaths, and the smallest
during April, when there were deaths.

, “Table C” shows that of the deaths recorded during the
year,  or per cent., were males, and  or per
cent., were females; and of the still-births, were males and
  were females. |

“Table D” gives the deaths by sex and age, showing that of
the total deaths,  or per cent., were under year
of age,  or per cent., were under years of age, and
 or per cent., had been over years of age.

During the preceding year per cent. were under  
year of age, per cent. were under years of age, and  
per cent. over years of age, showing, by comparison, the deaths

under one to be relatively the same, while there is slight
decrease in the per cent. under five years of age and slight
increase in those over years of age during the present year.

“Table KE” presents the exact cause of each death occurring
in the city during the year. It shows deaths from contagious
diseases, as compared with during the preceding year;  

deaths from Tuberculosis, as compared with during  In

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
the nervous diseases there is decrease in Meningitis and Cerebral Inflammation, and an increase in apoplectic diseases noted.
We find an increase proportionately in the acute diseases of the
Kidneys, while in the deaths from disease of the Digestive and
Circulatory systems, there is little or no change. In the Respiratory tract we find marked decrease in deaths from Pneumonia
and Bronchitis.

“Table F,” giving the number of deaths in the various institutions in the city and in each ward, with the death-rate per
thousand population in each, will be of interest as showing the
portion of the city in which the largest and smallest amount of
sickness has existed. We find again, as during the preceding
year, that in Wards Two and Four, where are our most crowded
tenement districts, the number of deaths and the death-rate are
the highest, while Ward Five has had the smallest number of
deaths.

Twenty and sixty-two one bundredths per cent. of the total
deaths occurred in the institutions. .

In “Table G” will be seen the nativity of those dying in the
city during  Of the deaths,  or per cent.,
were born in Holyoke;  or per cent., in the United
States;  or per cent., in Ireland;  or per
cent., in Canada;  or per cent., in Germany;  or  
per cent., in Scotland;  or per cent., in England, and the
remainder in various other foreign countries. |

“Table shows the place of interment of all bodies buried
in the city and the number of bodies sent away for burial. It |
also shows that during the year bodies were brought to Holyoke for burial, and that there have been local burials. Nine
hundred and fourteen burial permits have been issued from the
office during the year. |

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
CONTAGIOUS DISEASES.

During the year ending November Holyoke has
again been visited by what promised to be the largest epidemic
of small pox in the history of the city. Starting as it did in one
of the most crowded tenement districts, and in addition having
been hidden from the authorities for sufficient time to allow its
development, it seems impossible that it could be controled with
less than several hundred cases and the exposure of large number of people.

Energetic work by the members of the Board and its officials, aided by the willingness with which the people in general
submitted to the work of general vaccination, served to control
the outbreak to thirty-nine cases, nearly all being confined to the
two localities in which it was first discovered.

In all of the other contagious diseases, with the exception of
typhoid fever, there has been material decrease from  The number of cases are as follows: oS

Scarlet Typhoid Small Memb.
Diphtheria. Measles. Fever. fever. Pox. Croup. Total.
 ,:   
, DIPHTHERIA.

There has been reported during the year one hundred and
thirty-one cases of diphtheria in comparison to two hundred and seventy-two reported during  reduction of

over per cent in the number of cases. There have been  
deaths from this disease, death rate of per cent. The
larger number of these cases have been in wards two and three,
especially the former. It has existed in all of the wards, Ward
Four however having but one case.

The disease has made its appearance to some extent every
month throughout the year, being most prevalent in December,
January and June.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
MEASLES.
The number of cases of measles has decreased over twothirds of those reported during  there having been only  
. cases, as compared with cases last year. There have been
four deaths from this disease during the year, death-rate of  
per cent. The disease has existed throughout the year, and, with
the exception of Ward Two, bas been in every ward, Wards
Three and Four, however, having most of the cases. —
SCARLET FEVER.

There have been cases of scarlet fever during the year,
as compared with cases reported during  Three of these
cases have proven fatal, death-rate of per cent. This disease
has also been present throughout the year, and has been located
in all parts of the city, Ward Two suffering the most from it.

TYPHOID FEVER.

Typhoid fever has been little more prevalent than during
the previous year. There have been reported cases with  
deaths, death-rate of per cent., or about one death from
this disease to every inhabitants. This disease has also
been general, not limited to any locality of the city, and existed
chiefly during the first three months of the year.

; SMALL POX.

Small pox appeared in our city on January at  
Spring Street. The case was quickly removed to the Pest House,
a quarantine established at the block, and all of the residents vaccinated. No new cases appeared from this source.

On February mild case was discovered at Potvin
Avenue, where the same system was established.

On February case was reported at Lyman Street, and

‘upon investigation it was found that the patient had just moved
to that number from Lyman Street, at which place were
found eight cases in various stages of the disease. During the

, REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
next few days six more persons came down with the disease at
this place, and at various times from then until April  th cases
appeared at various places in the neighborhood, all being traced
to this source of infection. |

In all cases of this dreaded disease were reported to
the Board. While general vaccination was not ordered it was
requested that all corporations have their employees vaccinated
and all schools were inspected and unvaccinated children vaccinated. In addition to this strict quarantine was observed in all
blocks where this disease had occurred. The large majority of
the cases were of mild character and it is with pleasure that we
report that there were no fatalities during the epidemic.

The total expense of this epidemic was This |
expense including not only all of the bills for the cases of small
pox themselves but also those of the quarantine, including food
and fuel for all those who were quarantined by order of the
Board, which number varied from sixty to over seven hundred at

 different times. It also includes all bills for policing the quarantined districts, all physicians’ bills for care of cases and also for
services in vaccinating school children, all of the expenses of the
pest house and also bills for clothing, etc., for patients on their
release from the quarantine.

This presents cost per capita, for the cases, of ,
which is considered by the authorities as below the average’.
expense per case.

CONTAGIOUS DISEASE HOSPITAL. :
The Board would once again call attention to the imperative
need of hospital for the care of diseases of contagious nature,
especially diphtheria and scarlet fever. The value of such institutions is being realized more and more each year and many of
the cities of the state now have such accommodations which
greatly aid in the control of epidemics of such diseases. With
our large tenement districts, it is evident that we should have |
such building at our command in this city.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
 PEST HOUSE.

 The pest house at present in use by the city is well suited
in most ways and furnishes very satisfactory as well as secluded
place of confinement for persons suffering with small pox. Improvements should however be made in the building in the sanitary arrangements. sanitary system should be arranged to
remove the sewage from the building and satisfactory receptacle
made for the same. small addition should also be added, to
include disinfecting room for those who are obliged to visit the
building, and also bath room for the use of the patients.

These are indispensable necessities and should receive immediate attention.

HEALTH OFFICER.
To the Board of Health. |
GENTLEMEN :—I hereby submit report’ of your Health
Officer for the past year. During the year much time has been
 devoted to the disinfection of bouses where cases of contagious
disease have occurred. This work was increased owing to the |
) large number of Small Pox cases in the early part of the year.
In this line of work twelve hundred and eight rooms have been
disinfected with Formaldehyde gas, and large amount of
bedding has been destroyed.

I am happy to report smaller number of minor nuisances,
such as dirty cellars and tenements, in which work was greatly
aided by the large property owners, also general improvement
in all the fruit products sold by peddlers and in stores in this city.

I wish to congratulate the Board on the large number of
old buildings removed during the year, the number being
twenty-six.

Other duties performed by your officer are sufficiently set
forth in the accompanying tables. Several verbal and minor
complaints have beén attended to which were not of sufficient
importance to be entered upon the records.

while there has been comparatively small amount of new work
for the preceding year, large number of houses with defective
plumbing have been condemned and repaired to conform to the

REPORT OF THE
BACTERIOLOGIST.
To the Board of Health.

GENTLEMEN: have the honor to submit the following report for the year ending December .

No change has been made in the manner of conducting the
work of the bacteriologist for the past year, messenger from the

laboratory going to Holyoke for the swabs in the afternoon and the
reports being made by telephone about o’clock in the morning.
Ina number of instances it has been possible to make an absolute
diagnosis of case as soon as the swab reached the laboratory, and
in such cases the physician has been notified at once of the presence of diphtheria germs in the case from which the swab was
taken.

Diphtheria has not been prevalent during the past year, but
there have been referred to me for examination cases, a
marked diminution in number from the number received during
  and  of these cases were examined at the onset of
the illness, and diphtheria germs were found in cases,
while in the remaining cases no-diphtheria organisms were
found; cases were examined at the time of release only and
in eleven of these no diphtheria germs were found at any time.

By reference to the table below, it will be noted that in five
months out of the twelve, and in months where there was but
little diphtheria in the city, the number of cases that showed no
diphtheria germs exded the number in which diphtheria was
found. This fact is significant, showing as it does the care that

"the physicians take in determining the character of sore throats, |
using this method of diagnosis at time when diphtheria was
not prevalent in the city. The belief is becoming more and more
pronounced that much of our diphtheria is spread by mild and

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
unrecognized cases of the disease, and it is an encouraging fact
to Health officials that the physicians generally recognize this, —
and are careful to determine by the culture method the character
of the infection of all doubtful cases of “sore throat.”

examined during the year.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF
PARK COMMISSIONERS. |
To His Honor the Mayor and Board of Aldermen. !

- Genriemen:—In accordance with the public statutes, it
becomes the’ duty of this Board to render to you an account of
their doings for the past year. We, therefore, beg to submit
herewith our annual report for the year  .

In presenting to you this report we regret to say that we
have not been able to show the progress that we would liked to
have made or would have accomplished, had we more funds at
our disposal, but the limited appropriation given compelled us to
forego making many improvements which were already arranged
for, and which we considered essential and necessary. It is to be

regretted that more progress cannot be made towards improving —.
our present areas, as well as to increasing same. We should be
in position where we could make additional purchases of land
yearly, to be used for park purposes, as well as establishing playgrounds in different sections of the city. There is no reason
why Holyoke should not be well to the front iu her park system,
but on the contrary she is farin the rear. With population
made up largely of working people, whose sole recreation is the
parks, it becomes necessity that sufficient areas should be established in proportion to the population. tax of five cents per
hundred dollars would give us ample funds for purchases of new
areas and development of our present parks in first class manner.

This Board is anxious and ambitious to bring our city up to
near the standard of other cities of equal size and condition, and
if we can have sufficient funds at our disposal we can attain that

  REPORT OF THE PARK COMMISSIONERS.
point. Onur parks are all well patronized and we believe appreciated as rule good order is maintained, and very little trouble
, ig experienced with petty thieving of flowers and malicious
mischief.
A few figures taken from the last Park Census of the United.
States for may be of interest, as well as showing the
present standing of our city in comparison with similar cities of
the same size. Holyoke’s rating is that of fourth-class, and in
this class she ranks out of total of  which is very low ;
and the reason for this is because we have not park of ten
-acres or more that is developed and yet we have an assessed  
- valuation of If we were to have tax af five cents  
per one hundred dollars (the same as in some cities) we should i
have an apportionment of  to be devoted to parks.
The average cost per capita for maintenance is from to  
cents per year, while Holyoke spends less than cents per .
capita. According to this same census, we are credited with
having one acre to every inhabitants, while the average
amount of park area, according to size of cities of inhabitants and over, should be one acre to every of population, '
with playground of feet square to every square mile, and ,
in densely populated sections more than that, and one-twentieth
of city’s area should be devoted to parks; then the proportion |
required for our parks would be acres, while at the present
time we have onlv about acres devoted to that purpose.
Notwithstanding the limited amount of funds at our disposal, we have been able to make some progress towards improvements and additions, notably: The erection of sanitary for
women and children on Prospect park. That this was needed
and appreciated is shown by the number using same, which has
averaged over per day for the season, and the same was not
completed until the first of August. We have as fine and complete building as can be found in the State. matron was
put in charge, who has kept the place in very neat and clean
condition, and maintained good order and administered to all
who might require her services. We have also partially established on this park playground for children. We have put in

REPORT OF THE PAkK COMMISSIONERS.  
see-saws, swings and sand courts, and intend to further complete
same by adding merry-go-rounds, apparatus for gymnastics and a
kindergarten playground for very young children. That these
have been needed and: have been greatly appreciated is shown by
the large number who have used them.

It was the intention of the Board to have commenced upon  
the development of Elmwood Park, but owing to lack of funds
we were not able to do any work, but have had plans prepared
by landscape architects all ready for next spring, at which time
we hope to push the work rapidly along. ;

We have made an improvement on Hampden Park by re- 
moving the wooden tank house and placing thereon neat and
serviceable drinking fountain, and have also returfed the edges

- of the entire park.

In addition to all of the above, we have placed on the various
parks new settees, and thoroughly fertilized the parks, the
advisability of which has been amply demonstrated by the fine
condition of the grass all during thesummer. If you would have’ 
our city beautiful and come up to the standard of other cities,
and furnish open breathing spots for the people, then you must
be more liberal with this Board as to funds.

We submit herewith our report covering the receipts and

" expenditures on the various parks for the past year, together with
an account of expenditures for each of the several parks, full
report of the cost of Prospect Park Sanitary, and an itemized
account of the expenditures on all the parks: :
