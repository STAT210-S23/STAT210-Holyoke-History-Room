MAYOR'S ADDKESS.

Gentlemen of the Buard of Aldermen:—

Once more desire to thank the people of Holvoke for their
continued confidence. realize fully that the duties of this
office should be performed with the sole object in view of pushing our city forward to the front rank, always working for the
best interests of the whole people. ‘lhe municipal departments
have been doing good work during the past year and merit a
word of commendation. ‘Too often the good is overlooked and |
the faults magnified. Public servants many times are looked —
upon with suspicion because of political animosities. know :
the conduct of the different departments will compare favorably
with any city in the Commonwealth, and each department is at
all times ready to receive suggestions for improvement from any

— itizen. ‘The same policy of paying as we go has been followed
this past year so that we have not created any debt for our running expenses.
, FINANCIAL STATEMENT.

The City Auditor has published each month the full financial statement of the city and it can be read in his annual report,
so merely give the net bonded debt of the city for the past
four years. |
Dec. the net bonded debt of the city was 
Dec. the net bonded debt of the city was  
Dec. the net bonded debt of the city was  

This increase was caused by the borrowing of  for 
three school houses and the withdrawal of  from the
sinking fund of the Water Department for new service system.

, MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
. December the net bonded debt of the city was |
$ decre se during the past year of ,
and this in the face of the large expense we have been put to
for litigation and for the many improvements that have been |
made. The expert accountant who has examined the financial
condition of the city for the past three years has made state- |
ment showing that the city has made net gain in its financial |
condition during that period of y. in other words we
are that much better off than we were three years ago and this is
in addition to our litigation expenses and one year school bond
loan of  issued in and paid during the first year of
this administration for the running expenses of the schools during the previous year. .
We have an unexpended balance at the close of the year of
|  in addition to  received from the Holyoke &
Westfield R. R. stock, being per cent dividend. wish it
| were possible to impress more strongly upon our manufacturers
and merchants, as well as upon each city department, that the
city receives practically one half of the gross receipts of the
Company and that special effort should be made to have all |
freight shipped by this road. The amount received this year
is nearly equal to reduction of fifty cents per thousand dollars
on the tax rate, after paying the interest on the money borrowed
for the purchase of the stock in that road.
| SCHOOLS.
The buildings started year ago have all been completed
and are fully appreciated by the scholars benefited thereby.
: There is need of additional accommodations in Ward Two, and
these should be provided and can be by an addition to the Sargeant Street School. Our Superintendent, Mr. Louis P. Nash,
and his competent corps of teachers are working for the best
interests of our scholars, but trust may be pardoned for suggesting that the time allowed is none too long and that as few
unnecessary breaks as possible, for even single day, should be
made, for every interruption deprives the scholars of valuable

time which can never be made up. ‘The benefit and advantage
of the scholars are the sole objects that should be considered at
all times. Our School Department is still costing too much
money and there is abundant room for curtailing expenditures.
In spite of my recommendation that Grammar School principals
should be given two schools where it is possible, the Board did |
not see fit to adopt the suggestion and passed the order over a
veto from the Mayor when an opportunity was presented to
make start in the new Highlands School, thus refusing to try
the plan. This plan works successfully in other cities and
should be given trial here. The statement has been publicly
made that our School Department costs the most to maintain
per pupil of any city in the State except one. If this is true
there is something wrong and the School Board should find out
the cause and correct it. believe there is great opportunity

to economize in this Department without curtailing its efficiency
and all expenditures should be carefully scrutinized. ,

POLICE DEPARTMENT.
The Police Department this past year has been subjected to

a most severe attack, principally on account of an alleged laxness in enforcing the liquor laws against Sunday liquor selling |
by the hotels to those not guests. If the charges are true it behooves the members of the police force to be more diligent
during the coming year and not again leave themselves open to
this criticism. ‘The police force is not the place for men afflicted with partial blindness and trust they will be diligent in ,
their watchfulness. ‘The selling of liquor on Sundays seems to
be one of the problems of the present day which is confronting
all centers of population and upon which opinions differ. The
law requires that sales in hotels shall be made only to those who
resort thereto for food or lodging, and under that cloak the law
is violated. ‘The merits or demerits of Sunday liquor selling are
not open to discussion by the Police Department. The law as
it stands should be enforced, and if the public does not like the
law its remedy is to elect representatives who will change the

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
law to suit the majority of the people. My own idea is there
are too many hotel licenses granted in Holyoke. wrote the
Commissioners to that effect before the licenses were granted
last April. They acted within their powers in granting the
number they did. It becomes difficult to ascertain exactly who
are guests at these hotels without the employment of spotters
and do not think public opinion approves of such methods.
Public opinion does want the Sabbath observed properly and
within the law and that rests with the people themselves. There
is too much of tendency to let down the bars all along the line.
Drug stores violate the law by selling articles other than for
. medicinal use. The law allows newspapers and cigars to be
sold but not everything else, and the Police Department cannot
follow the citizens into every store to see if the law is violated.
The public should refrain from purchasing articles on Sunday
contrary to law and this will help to remedy the evil. When |
the majority of people desire Continental Sunday” the Sun- |
day laws will be abolished by statute, but until then every citi- |
zen should see that he observes the law; not only that relating
to the selling of liquors, but the Sunday laws for making em. ployees labor. recommend that the License Commissioners,
individually, as well as the Police Department, inspect the ho- |
tels and see for themselves whether or not the laws are being |

| properly observed, especially on Sundays and holidays, and if
| violations are observed have the license of the violator revoked.
I know we have as efficient City Marshal as the city has ;
ever had and the members of our police force are in the main
, conscientious and desirous of doing their duty but they cannot
do the impossible and they get very little commendation for

their work. believe the work of our Police Department, the
good order of our city and the law abiding spirit of our citizens
will be found to compare favorably with that of any city in New
England. ‘The recommendations of the Marshal regarding ad- ,
ditions to the force are worthy of attention by your honorable |
Board. It may be advantageous to try the permanent beats .
this year and hold each officer responsible for everything in
violation of law that takes place on his beat. police building |
will be welcome when the finances of the city will permit.

, MAYOR’S ADDRESS.  
FIRE DEPARTMENT. |
The Fire Department has made its usual good showing dur- ;
ing the past year. No stronger commendation can be given
than that the loss was only where  worth
of property was endangered with net loss to the property :
owners after insurance losses were adjusted of only .

 The Commissioners have recently placed the department on
a permanent basis by the addition of twenty-two extra men,
doing away with the call men. There will thus be at fire a
large enough force to handle it at the start and that is the
proper time for fighting fire advantageously. ‘The Commissioners recommend changes and additions to several of the
houses. If the High Street Engine House can be sold to good
advantage the department would be benefited by the erection of
its central house in new location. If we could also dispose of
Mt. Tom Engine House in Ward One we could erect one near |
the center of the ward on the property which the city now owns
on Lyman street and which has recently been vacated by the
School Department. An addition ought also to be built to the
Highland Fngine House as the present quarters are too small
and an addition to the present house might be built without
great expense. ‘This Department cost us during the past year
 :

BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS. ,

The Board of Public Works has maintained its reputation
during the past year for the wise expenditure of its appropriations. It has made many improvements on the streets, has
built new bridge on Bridge street and another on Jackson
street and has kept wise oversight of the city property. The
patronage of the two bath houses has clearly demonstrated that
the people appreciate such public improvements. ‘The Board
recommends that another one be built during the coming year in
Ward Four. It also favors considerable expenditure for keep  MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
ing the streets in good condition and for making additional improvements. )

The collection of ashes and garbage under the direction of
this Board is not wholly satisfactory and the members should
devote their best attention to remedying the trouble, though this primarily rests with the individual citizen. Unless each
individual makes it personal matter to see that ashes and garbage are not mixed this work can never be done in satisfactory
manner. If the individual will look after his back door as well
as his front door great saving can be made to the city in the
performance of this work. new bridge may be required on
Main street over the third level canal as the present one has
passed its period of usefulness. The street under the Holyoke
& Westfield railroad tracks below the bridge should be widened
as it is too narrow for the traffic in that section.

BOARD OF HEALTH. :

The members of the Board of Health continue to perform
efficient service for the health of the city. They have kept up their

, former high standard of work which is shown by the general
good health of our citizens. The health officer continues his
vigilance which is so necessary for the prevention of the spread
of contagious diseases. ‘This Board should have full oversight |
of the inspection of milk, vinegar and petroleum, and your honorable Board should frame an ordinance to this effect.

PARKS.

The Park Commissioners have recently brought to the attention of the public the deficiency of our city in public parks.
The report of Frederick L. Olmstead, one of the best landscape
gardners in the country, is annexed to their report and should
be read by all the citizens. Their request for an appropriation
seems high but if during the next ten years certain amount
of permanent work is done on our park system each year the result will be credit to our city. earnestly recommend to the

MAYOR’S ADDRESS. II
careful consideration of your honorable Board the full report of
the Park Commissioners. The large attendance at the concerts
which the Commissioners have provided shows that these con- 
certs are appreciated by the people.

. WATER DEPARTMENT.

The Water Commissioners have laid new system of service
pipe which will greatly increase the efficiency of our supply system. They have also during the past year turned over to the
City Treasurer the raised for the Water Department
by taxation in  together with the interest thereon, and this
has been expended for permanent municipal improvements under the direction of the Board of Public Works. For the past
four years the city departments have not paid the Water Department anything for the amount of water used. special act
was passed in the last legislature authorizing the city departments to pay the Water Department for all water taken by them.
The Water Department, as it is now in such good financial condition, is to turn into the sinking fund of the city sum at the
same rate as paid by other corporations on its total construction
account. In other words, the Water Department is to be paid
for its water and to pay tax to the city proper as if it were a
private corporation. While this department has expended over
$  in addition to its running expenses for its magnificent water supply system since  its net debt is less than
$ so that it has practically made  profit in the
last thirty years and the system is in every respect up to date.
The high service system should be increased during the coming )
year so that the Highlands may receive more pressure. ‘The
water rates are now practically the lowest of any city in the
State, and after the high pressure system is completed this Department could afford to turn over to the sinking fund an additional amount each year. :

‘
. MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
NEW PUBLIC LIBRARY.
The new Public Library building is practically completed
and is lasting monument to the generosity of our citizens.
Though built by private subscription it is no less for the benefit
of the public and will prove of great advantage to the citizens
and strong factor for the advancement and welfare of our people. ‘The architect, Mr. J. Clough, has generously given his
services to the making of building which is great ornament
as well as source of usefulness.
CITY ENGINEER’S DEPARTMENT.
This Department has maintained its high standard of excellence. ‘The bridge near the Valley Mill which was planned by
the City Engineer is credit to himself and to the city. He
has built strong bridge at very moderate cost. ‘The Jackson street bridge is also credit to this Department. During
the past year the Highlands sewer system has been started.
This coming year should see it advanced still more. ‘The work
of this Department has been done in careful and. painstaking
and conscientious manner and the hard work that has been put
in is fully appreciated by our citizens. |
, |
OVERSEERS OF THE POOR.
The members of this department have been diligent in their
' business and looked after the poor of our city in faithful and |
conscientious manner. While the expenditures of the year have
been trifle higher than that of the preceding year, the members should be commended for the results which they have accomplished with the co-operation of our efficient City Almoner.
This Department cost last year an increase of nearly
$  over the preceding year. |

MAYOR’S ADDRESS.  
, LEGAL DEPARTMENT.

The City Solicitor has performed his duties in thoroughly
eficient manner. ‘The cases that he has attended to are shown
in full in his report. In the Lyman Mills case the auditor has
filed his report in favor of the city in all its contentions. [am
informed that it is the purpose of the Lyman Mills Co. to retry
the whole case before the Superior Court.

In the Municipal Lighting case the hearings have been continued before the Commissioners, the evidence has been closed,
the arguments for the City finished and those for the Water
Power Company nearly completed. We hope for finding from
the Commissioners which will be satisfactory to both sides and
that the City may commence municipal ownership of its gas and
electric light plants this coming year. believe that when these
plants are secured Board of Directors should be appointed
which will start these plants in thoroughly business-like manner, for only on strictly business basis can municipal ownership ever be successful.

IN CONCLUSION
i am grateful for the efficient co-operation afforded by the
different departments during the past year. ‘There has been
very little friction of any kind and only in such way can the
citizens receive the best results. It should be our aim to progress and strive at all times to improve the efficiency of every
department. In order that the citizens may feel at liberty to
suggest and criticize any municipal acts either of the Mayor or
. any of the departments, have decided to invite from any citizen either suggestions, criticism or complaints regarding any
municipal business. All communications whether written or
oral will be treated as strictly confidential if so requested, but
the name of the individual must be known to me as guarantee
of good faith. Any act of negligence of the city employees or
complaint of any nature is requested in order that the people
may receive the greatest efficiency. If any citizen has any com  MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
plaint or suggestion the time to make it is not after the event is ,
forgotten but at the time it occurs. trust the citizens will |
take advantage of this and that it will result in some good. No i
anonymous communications however will be considered. There
is no reason why Holyoke should not be the most progressive
city in this Commonwealth.
With our enterprising citizens, ample water supply, good |
schools, streets and sewers, we should strive to make our city
a leader among Massachusetts municipalities.

HOLYOKE, January .

I hereby certify that have examined the cash book of the
Board of Water Commissioners, for the year ending December
 Igo and find it correctly added.

The vouchers for payments are properly approved, and the
cash balance, has been duly verified.

| D. W. KENNEY,
City Auditor.

In presenting our report for rg  we wish to make mention
of few things of special interest.

In our last report we called attention to the new  -inch
main from Ashley Pond to Dwight street, work on which was
commenced last year, but suspended on account of the delay in
securing pipe.

The laying of this new main was completed during the early
fall, and we find our expectations amply fulfilled, the pressure on
High street alone having increased some twenty pounds. The
benefit from this is, we think, appreciated by our property
owners and business men, for in addition to the better service
for domestic and other purposes there is an additional benefit to
be derived in case of fire.

We also extended our mains in the Highland and Elmwood
districts, as is shown under Table A, and laid  o-inch main
from the end of the  -inch main at Dwight street through
Maple street to Hampden street.

Under special Act of the Legislature, which was sanctioned
by this board, directing us so to do, we paid the City the money
loaned the department in  together with the interest on
same, which amounted to .

The town of Easthampton damage case, the largest of the

. \
  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.
damage cases resulting from the diverting of the southwest
branch of the Manhan river to secure what is known as our
Fomer supply, was settled on June  th, by an agreement for an
entry of judgment for  and taxable costs.

This we consider was very satisfactory settlement for the
City, due largely to the thorough preparation of the City’s case, 

 backed up by formidable array of engineering talent.

The water supply for the past year has been up to the usuals
excellent standard, both for quality and quantity, barring fishy
taste for few weeks in the Highland district, the average
height for the year at Ashley Pond reservoir being twelve feet
and eight inches, as against an average height of twelve feet and
one inch for the year before.

The receipts from water rents for the past year were little
over  in excess of those for the year previous.

By the special Act passed by the Legislature, above referred
to, this department is to receive compensation from the City for
the water used in its various departments, and an annual rental
of  per public hydrant for that used for fire purposes, which
includes the cost of furnishing and maintaining the hydrants, and !

: in turn the Commissioners are authorized and directed to pay
over to the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund of the city, each
year, from the net earnings of the department, percentage upon
the total cost of construction of the water works, as estimated

, in the annual reports, the same as the percentage of taxation
established for city, county and state taxes in the City of HolyOke in that year. The amount so paid is to be used toward the
payment of municipal bonds, other than water bonds.

We estimate that at the present rate of taxation the department will pay to the City about this coming year, recelving in return for the water used in the different departments,
including the rental of hydrants, about  to ,
thus leaving the net amount to be paid the City about 
to .

While there does not appear to be much reason for congratulating ourselves on this new arrangement, we feel certain
there will be very considerable saving in the consumption of

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
water in the municipal buildings, especially the schools, the
necessity for which we called to your attention in last year’s
report. a

An effort will be made to push the work on the High Ser| vice reservoir the coming year, as fast as the funds of the department will warrant. :
| The Board has also under consideration the replacing of
some of the smaller mains in the city with larger ones, and the |
extension of others, with view to increasing the efficiency of
the department.

REPORT OF
FIRE COMMISSIONERS.
| OFFICE OF FIRE COMMISSION, t
HotyokE, Mass., Dec. gor. |
To the Honorable Mayor and City Council:

GENTLEMEN :—In compliance with the requirements of the |
City Ordinance, your Board of Fire Commissioners present their
report for the year ending December  rgor.

The Board organized January  th, rgo by the election of
Charles L. Newcomb as chairman, Daniel Proulx as vice-chairman and John Hildreth as secretary. Your Commissioners have
held seventeen formal meetings and many informal meetings
during the past year.

There have been fires and alarms during the past year,
with total damage to buildings and contents of of
this amount  was paid by insurance companies, leaving
a net loss to our citizens of more detailed account
of the fires and losses will be found under the head of fires and
alarms.

We are glad to report that, notwithstanding the fact that we
have had eleven fires more than last year, the net loss on the
fires is smaller than last year, and our total fire losses are phenomenally low. The record for the past year speaks in no uncertain tone of the faithful and efficient work both of the officers
and men in our department. We are very glad to report that we
have had no repetition of the serious fatalities to human life
that marked last year’s record, and that this year we are not

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.

obliged to record any large tire; while many of the fires were
quite serious they were extinguished with very small loss. The
work of the department has been excellent and we cheerfully
bear testimony to the ability and faithfulness of the members
of the department in performing their difficult and dangerous
work.

A careful and close supervision of the working of our present
department has convinced your Board that the sooner the department is made permanent one the better it will be for the
city. We have canvassed this matter thoroughly and find that
public sentiment very generally approves of this change. ‘lhe
only objection urged by any one to this change has been that
the city could not afford permanent department, but after
carefully going over this matter we are satisfied that very efficient force can be maintained at little if any increased cost to
the city. Of course if the city continues to grow the expense
of maintaining the department will naturally grow also, and it
would do this under the present system; it needs no argument
to show the weakness of our present department. We have not
suficient permanent men to grapple with fire of any considerable magnitude, and while the call force is getting to the fire

there is great danger of its getting beyond the control of the
few permanent men that we can now put at fire. During the

day time the call men are scattered all over the city at their
various places of employment, and very often they are obliged to

go out of the city, and if an alarm is rung in they cannot possibly respond, and when they do respond they are generally so far
away from the engine house to which they belong that before
they can possibly get there the fire is either out or beyond control, and your Commissioners have found that there is grow: ing indisposition on the part of our business men to allow their
employees to leave their work every time fire alarm is rung; it
very often means serious loss to the employer to have his servant drop the work which he is doing at moment’s notice to
respond to an alarm, and these alarms are coming more frequently. We had calls last year and quite number of very
good call men have been obliged to resign their positions because

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.  
their employers did not feel that they could allow them any
longer to remain in the department, and there are good many
others who only allow call men to respond to these calls under
protest.
Some of the reasons which have induced your Commissioners to advocate this change are as follows, viz: We shall always
have at moment’s notice sufficient number of trained, practical men to control any ordinary fire, and if. the alarm is
promptly given we are confident that very few fires will assume
serious proportion. Again, we believe that there ought to be |
some one on duty during every hour of the day and night to
attend to telephone calls. The importance of this will readily
be seen when we remember that we had forty-nine still alarms
last year. Of course under the present system it would be
impossible to carry out this plan; we are satisfied that the
lives and property of our citizens will be better cared for by :
experienced permanent men than by call force, especially
when we remember the tendency of modern times to erect high |
buildings, which call for nerve and experience in climbing; and
when we remember what large place electricity now fills in our
city, it is evident that firemen should be thoroughly familiar
with this useful but dangerous power. }
During this past year we sent Captain P. J. Reilly to the
New York School of Instruction for Firemen, and he graduated
from that institution and is thoroughly competent to instruct his
fellow-firemen in all that goes to make up modern up-to-date
 fireman. Of course he can only give such instruction to permanent men, and we are satisfied that when your Commissionersshall make the change from call to permanent department, if
judgment is only suspended for little while, this new departure .
will meet the approval of practically every one. Your Commis
sioners propose to equip light patrol wagon which shall carry
eight men and who shall respond to all alarms and co-operate
with the men located at the various engine houses, thus making
it possible to have some seventeen to twenty men at any fire in
a few minutes after the alarm is rung.
 We thank the Honorable Mayor and Board of Aldermen for

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.

the very generous treatment of the department, and we have
endeavored to expend the money appropriated for us in the best
possible manner, and we make the following recommendations
and trust that they will receive careful consideration:

First. We recommend that new engine house be erected
this year to replace House No.  on High street. It is almost
impossible carry on the work of the department in this house;
there is no room to put either sufficient number of horses or
proper apparatus at this most important point; the street cars
interfere more and more with the free use of this house and many
narrow escapes of serious accidents have barely been averted.

Second. We recommend for House No. that there should
be eight new Lynn stalls placed there at once.

Third. We repeat our recommendation of last year, House
No. should be enlarged in accordance with the plan of City
Engineer; the extension of this house should be placed on the

west side. It is now so very crowded that there is not room
enough to accommodate the apparatus and horses kept there.
We would again reiterate our recommendation that hospital be
erected here; this would result in quite saving to the city, as
we are now obliged to board out our sick horses.

fourth. House No.  still very poorly adapted for an
engine house, and as soon as the city can dispose of this house
it should be done, and new modern fire engine house erected
nearer the center of the ward.

fifth. House No.'  has been very much improved by the
removal of the brick partition wall which ran through the center
of this house. The staircase leading to the hall is not very well
planned, and is rather dangerous and should be improved.

Sixth. We call the particular attention of the Board of Public
Works to our recommendation for many years that holes be cut
in the footpaths of all bridges, so that we may not be obliged to
tear up the planking when we need to draw water from the
canals. We would also continue to recommend the erection of
standpipes at various points on the canal banks for the purpose
of taking water from the canal.

Seventh, We respectfully request the Board of Water Com| REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.  
missioners to improve the high-level service. The water pressure
on the Highlands and at Elmwood continues to be very poor;
several times during the past year we have been hindered in extinguishing fires by poor water supply. If we should have a
large fire in these districts with the present pressueé it would be
a very serious matter.

MANUAL FORCE.

The permanent force has been increased during the past year
by the addition of two men, Charles F. Aurnhammer and George
A. Ellison. These two men during the summer months sprinkled
the streets in the vicinity of their engine houses, and as the Board
of Public Works pays for their services this addition has cost the
department very little.

The permanent force now consists of the following, viz:
Chief, Superintendent of Fire Alarm Telegraph, ten captains,
four lieutenants, two engineers of steamers, sixteen drivers, and
five permanent men. ‘The total force in the department is as
follows, viz.:

Permanent force,  
And the call force consists of

Assistant Engineers, Lo  
Engineers of steamers,  
Stokers of steamers, wo

Substitutes,  

Total force,  

APPARATUS.

Most of the apparatus is in good condition. We have purchased during the past year an automatic lock to hold the ladders in place while on the truck. This is very ingenious de  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS. vice and was invented by Assistant Engineer McCarthy, of this —
city. We have also purchased an automatic tiller lock for con| trolling the wheels of the zrial truck; this is very heavy piece
of apparatus and very difficult to control, but with this new de- ,
vice it is easily managed. The Fire Commissioners have also
purchased during the past year an automobile for the use of the
Chief, and while this piece of apparatus was not specially made
for fire department service it has demonstrated very clearly that |
with properly constructed machine there would be no question
that on the grounds of economy and efficiency an automobile is
vastly superior to horse and carriage, and while your Commis- a
sioners have been somewhat criticised for this purchase we are
satisfied that in the future in all well-equipped fire departments
some form of horseless carriage will be used.

The apparatus now in active service consists of six steam
fire engines, two double-tank chemical engines, one combination
hose and chemical wagon, six two-horse hose wagons, one erial
truck, two hook and ladder trucks, tive exercise and supply
wagons, one chief’s buggy, one superintendent of fire alarm
wagon, three sleighs, and one automobile.

} HOSE.

We have purchased during the past year feet of hose.
The experience of the Fire Commissioners has been that it is .
poor policy to buy cheap hose, and for the last few years we
have been buying higher grade of hose, and we are satisfied
that in the long run this will be economy. We have in the
department the following hose, viz.: ,

HORSES. ,

We have thirty-seven horses in the department, most of
which are in excellent condition. The work called for by the
fire department is of such character as to make the time of
service of horses very short. horse may be apparently all
right one day and the next day he may be either dead or unfit
for use in the fire department. We have been obliged to purchase nine new horses during the past year, which has been a

, serious drain upon the finances. We trust the time is near at
| hand when horses can be largely dispensed with.
HAY AND FEED.
We have the usual amount of hay, feed and bedding on

HOUSES.
The Engine Houses, on the whole, are in very good condition. The various changes and improvements that are necessary we have referred to in our recommendations.
FIRE ALARM TELEGRAPH. |
There have been very few changes in this department during
the past year, but it will be necessary in the near future to make
numerous changes in this branch of the service. ‘lhe wires in ,
the thickly settled parts of the city must be placed under ground.
The responsibility resting upon this department is too great to
risk much longer overhead wires. strong wind, falling tree, |
or ice, may cut the circuit in two and so jeopardize many lives
- and much property. great deal of the success of the fire department has been possible only by the very efficient manner in
which this branch of our service has been run, and we have to
bear witness to the very efficient services of Superintendent
Castle.
There is in this department the following property, viz. :
Strong current protector board, 
Storage battery,  
Case and switchboard,   miles of wire,

FIRES AND ALARMS.

The number of fires and alarms during the past year was
 of which ror were rung in from signal boxes, fifty-eight
still alarms, and there were thirty-six fires where no alarm was
given. ‘There were thirteen false alarms.

The following is statement of the valuation of property

CONCLUSION. ,

In conclusion, we thank the Honorable Mayor and City
Council for the many acts of kindness and courtesy they have
shown us during the past year, and we sincerely trust that the
new Board of Aldermen will make ample appropriations so as to
enable us to keep our fire department in the front rank. There
are many needed improvements to which we have called your
attention, and we trust that these recommendations may receive
your serious consideration. We take this opportunity of thanking the Board of Public Works, the Board of Water Commissioners, the Police Department, the City Treasurer, and Auditor, and
all other city officials for the uniform courtesy shown us during 
the past year, and we hope that the Board of Water Commissioners will complete the work they have so well begun in supplying
the city with plenty of new modern hydrants.

Respectfully yours,
CHARLES L. NEWCOMB, Chairman.

 REPORT OF THE
SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
To his Honor the Mayor, and the Citizens of Holyoke:

The School Committe respectfully submit their annual report for the year nineteen hundred one.

The school department is increasin:, in accordance with the
general growth of our city. substantial increase in the
number of children is shown as compared with last year; we
trust that the department is advancing also in power and efficiency to bring about the highest development possible for the
pupils of our schools,—the young people of Holyoke.

The task which the School Committee have in hand is one |
of serious and sacred responsibility. The children now inschool will in very short time be the active citizens who will
direct the destiny of the city; and the kind of citizens that they
will be must depend in no small measure upon influences now
being exerted in the schools. The duties of the School Committee therefore ought to be performed without reference to
personal considerations of any sort, but with the single aim to
best serve the interests of the children in our schools. While
such considerations rule, the Committee will have the confidence
of the citizens, as has been the case in the past.

The work has gone on for the past year in harmony, and the
spirit of mutual good-will and co-operation rules throughout the
School Department. Owing to unequal growth, the three districts had become somewhat disproportionate, and the shares of
work and responsibility falling upon sub-committees were un-.
even. It has therefore been voted to re-arrange the districts.
This is the last report that will be presented with the districts
organized as at present. Hereafter the First District will in  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

clude schools known as North Chestnut street, Elm street,
Ewingville, Nonotuck street, Highlands, West Holyoke; the
Second District, South street, Appleton street, South Chestnut
street, Sargeant street, Springdale, Ingleside; the Third District, Bridge street, Dwight street, West street, Park street,
Hamilton street, Lyman street. |

We have registered pupils, and persons have been
regularly employed. ‘The total expenditure for last year was
$ of which  was expended for furnishing
new buildings, leaving  for current expenditure. The
Board of Public Works has expended making total
of  for the support of schools. The amount is large
one; and in growing city like our own, the cost will necessarily increase from year to year. As will be seen by reference
to the report of the Secretary, the per capita cost is less than
last year; and this is the only fair basis of comparison. :

For next year, we have to consider still further increase in

: numbers. We have opened practically three new buildings, and
have to pay for increased janitor service, more teachers, greater |
expense in every way. Besides these items, we have to reckon
$  for water, which has not been charged hitherto. For the
fiscal year ending Nov. we ask for an appropriation of
$ .

We must again call attention to the need for new buildings.
The situation at South Holyoke is very bad; there is urgent
need for more accommodation. We recommend an eight-room
addition to the Sargeant street building, and respectfully urge
that action in this matter may be taken at once. At Elm street
also, the matter must be taken in hand very soon. ‘The onestory part of the building should be carried up another story.
A separate building for offices should be built on the vacant lot
south of the school house. ‘The Oakdale district also needs a
new building.

REPORT OF THE ,
HIGH SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

The High School has terminated most successful year. The
excellent work of the past was strengthened. ‘To-day our school
occupies foremost place among the preparatory schools of this
Commonwealth. ‘This standing has been acquired through
earnest, faithful and conscientious work by the teachers, as
manifested by the thoroughness of the preparation of the students and their scholarly work in the higher educational institutions. We look forward to even greater advancement in the
preparation of the pupils, under the close and thorough attention now directed toward the exactness of preparatory courses
and the elimination of useless and burdensome material. ‘The
course of studies as at present adopted, with its clearly defined
sub-courses for entrance into higher institutions, will prove of

much value to the pupils.

In this connection we may safely call the attention of sucding Boards to the necessity of safeguarding the future and
in some manner devise scheme that would prevent larger communities from yearly raids on our teaching force. We have
been unusually fortunate this year in having lost only one of the )
force and that was the withdrawal of Mr. Downey, to accept a
more lucrative position at Worcester, Mass. Mr. Downey was a
most valuable teacher and we sincerely regret his loss. Mr.
Allen of this city was elected to fill the vacancy. ‘The Commercial and Manual Training departments show very large inCrease in attendance and it will be absolutely necessary in short
time to secure new teacher in each branch; it is needless to
say that neither of these important departments should be handicapped. It has been urged that military drill should be had

 REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
at the High School, but in our opinion success would not be had
unless this demand would come from the students themselves
in the same manner as the different athletic teams are now
managed. |
During the year we have given the use of the school building to different associations for educational purposes, but it is
expected that the demand will be somewhat lessened with the |
opening of the Holyoke Public Library. On the whole, there
has been no striking departure during the year; we have made |
every reasonable effort to keep down the large expense incident
to the proper maintenance of such large building, with its
, large teaching force and hundreds of students. Our idea has |
been rather to maintain high school than to branch out into
the college field. We wish to thank Principal Akers and the
High School teaching force for their united efforts in maintaining standard which can only reflect credit on our city. Fora

we respectfully refer you to the reports of the Principal of the
High School and the Superintendent of Schools.

| REPORT OF THE
FIRST DISTRICT COMMITTEE.
, This district includes the schools known as West Holyoke,
Ewingville, North Chestnut street, West street, Dwight street,
Bridge street. ‘There are pupils and teachers. The
Lyman street building is no longer occupied. ‘
Several of the buildings have profited by important repairs ;
| the grounds at Ewingville have been graded and beautitied with
shrubs and flowers, adding alike to the bea@ty and the usefulness of the school; the School Committee have furnished
curtains and furniture for several buildings; the buildings of
the district are in better condition than ever before.

Yet there are repairs and improvements that are very much
needed. At Bridge street there is only one staircase. If there
should be fire or panic in that building there might be terrible results. The plea for better sinitary accommodations at
Dwight street is not new, but it should grow more impressive
by repetition. At West street, new furniture is needed for the
hall and thorough repairs in the sanitaries. The North Chestnut street building is crowded, ill arranged, and faulty in many
ways. This is an expensive building it costs more in proportion to the number of children than almost any other building
in the city. This extra cost would pay the interest on aloan —
for new building.

At the close of the year in June, Mr. Henry W. Kirmayer
resigned, after four years of successful work as principal of the
Dwight street school. It was source of regret that we could )

not keep Mr. Kirmayer here longer. Miss Mary J. Brainard
was transferred from Bridge street to fill the vacancy, and Miss .
Katharine A. Mahoney was elected at Bridge street.

REPORT OF THE ,
SECOND DISTRICT COMMITTEE.

The affairs of this district have gone on smoothly for the
year just past. The enlarged building at Elmwood is now in
successful and satisfactory operation. Fourteen of the sixteen

‘rooms are occupied. An important improvement has been
. made in the furnishing of new windows at Appleton street.
The matters which most urgently demand attention are :—

 New, enlarged sanitaries at South Chestnut street, and
Appleton street some gradinz also at South Chestnut street to
keep surface water out of the cellar.

 The providing of additional school rooms in the vicinity
of the Elm street school, to accommodate the growing population of the district. It is our belief that this could be most
economically done by erecting separate building to serve as
headquarters for the school department, and by carrying up the
one-story part of the Elm street building another story.

 new building at Oakdale.

The schools of this district are: Elmwood, Springdale, South
Chestnut street, Appleton street, Elm street. There are  
pupils enrolled, and teachers.

Respectfully submitted,
G. P. ELLISON,
 T. J. LYNCH,
A. W. ESLEECK. :

REPORT OF THE

THIRD DISTRICT COMMITTEE.

This district includes the following schools: |Nonotuck
street, Highlands, Park street, Hamilton street, Sargeant street,
Springdale, Ingleside. ‘here are teachers and pupils.

In January the new building at Springdale was occupied,
with Miss Agnes C. Kelly as principal, also acting as teacher
of the upper grades. As the school grows, it will become

, necessary to appoint separate teacher for these grades, so that
the principal may be free to give undivided attention to the
conduct of the school as whole.

The Highlands building has been occupied for some months,
although in some respects the work has not yet been completed.
The building is an attractive one, and cannot fail to be valuable improvement to that part of the city. As part of the
teaching equipment, there is valuable natural history collection, and mineralogical collection is about to be begun by the
generous gift of an interested citizen. The collection of pictures
is one of the most extensive to be found in any school of this
sort in the country. Nearly  has been given for the purchase of pictures; and, as large orders were placed, and pictures
imported free of duty, it is probable that the collection repre- 
sents an expenditure at. least one-half larger, if bought in the
ordinary way. ‘These pictures will have most important effect
upon the general culture of the children. ‘The success of the
enterprise shows the liberal spirit of the people, and reflects
credit upon the principal of the school, who has worked untiringly for the collection.

We wish to present to the committee and to the people of
the city in the most urgent manner, the need for larger school

accommodation at South Holyoke. Our school rooms are overcrowded, and we are using some rooms which are not fit for
school rooms.

We ask that immediate steps be taken to build an eightroom addition to the Sargeant street building. All of these
rooms will be filled as soon as they can be ready. |
There are certain repairs that should be attended to at once.
The Hamilton street building is too dark. Walls and ceilings ,
should be painted in light colors. Another exit should be provided at Park street. Important repairs are needed at Nonotuck street. :

, REPORT OF THE
EVENING SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

In the organization of the evening schools, some changes
have been made. ‘The evening grammar school has been removed from the West street building and placed in the Appleton street building, being consolidated with the evening drawing 
school. ‘This change gives the school more central location,
and membership has accordingly increased. ‘The two evening
schools formerly held in the First Ward have been combined,
and the classes now all meet at the West street building. This |
year call was made for the teaching of.stenography at
the grammar school, but it came too late to be carried out
at this session. For next year it is recommended that classes in
stenography and typewriting be organized; indeed, it has been
the desire of your committee to offer instruction in any subject
for which there seemed to be demand.

It should be the aim of the School Department to so develop
the system of evening schools that young men and young women
of the city may cultivate their minds and fit themselves for
higher usefulness in any direction. Classes should be provided
for study in languages, in sciences, in higher mathematics or
other subjects, that there may be no lack of opportunity for any
who will make use of it.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON
Gentlemen of School Committee: :

We herewith submit to you our report of the appropriations
and expenditures for text books, educational supplies, building 
supplies, printing and advertising, for the year  go |

It has cost less to operate this department this year than
that of  notwithstanding the increased number of
pupils. We appreciate fully the economical methods introduced
by our efficient superintendent, Mr. L. P. Nash, and his earnest
faithful work pertaining to this department is plainly shown in
the figures of this report. His work meets with our approval.

 REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON
MANUAL TRAINING AND
KINDERGARTENS.

Among the most important matters for the consideration of

the School Committee is the extension of our course in manual

. training. Those towns and cities which lead in educational
matters are pushing steadily forward in developing courses of
manual training. ‘The subject has the very highest value, both
for the skill acquired and as means of mental culture; itis.
impossible for our city children, especially for the boys, to get.
any adequate training of their hands unless the schools will
provide it. It should be remembered that the law requires this
city to furnish manual training on exactly the same basis as
arithmetic; this law has not yet been complied with. It is

- evident that the School Committee cannot too soon take steps

to make manual training operative in some of the grammar
grades. We recommend that special teachers be engaged, and
that instruction be given to all pupils of Grades VIII and IX,
in suitable manual work. ,

Our kindergarten system is now nearly complete. Probably
one more kindergarten should be established, at the South
Chestnut street school. All parts of the city will then be supplied. The attendance will doubtless increase; but this increase in numbers may for long time be met by having part
of the children come in the afternoon. ‘There are now in the
city seven kindergartens—at Springdale, Ilamilton street, East
Dwight street, Elm street, North Chestnut street, and the

  REPORT OF THE SCHOUL COMMITTEE.
Highlands. There have been enrolled so far this year  
children and teachers. )
 The fer capita cost for maintaining kindergartens is very
high indeed this will be diminished somewhat, if plan for
afternoon work is carried out. But in any case, those who are.
most conversant with kindergarten work and its results will
unite in saying that it is well worth the cost.

  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

The year has been one of peaceful and orderly progress.
The city has done much by providing new buildings; books
and appliances for teaching have been furnished, as far as the
power and the means of the Committee would permit. Our
teachers have gratefully felt that they have the support of the
people and the Committee; and this attitude has contributed
essentially to the success of their work.

A distinguishing feature of the planning and the teaching in
all our school-rooms of to-day is, that great efforts are made to
find out just what the children do really need for their own best —
development. We do not lay down theory of education, to
which it becomes the duty of all schools and all children to
conform. On the contrary, we try patiently to find out what is
best for children; and then we try to make course of education that shall meet the needs of their growth. These needs are
constantly changing, with the changing conditions of society
about us. ‘Ihe needs of the children in our schools today are
very different from the needs of children who lived here, in a
little town, fifty years ago; or from those of children living now
in different sort of community. This involves the further
consideration that every child has his own nature, must work
out his own education, and has his special needs. ‘he teacher
must with conscientious and tireless patience, study to do the
best possible for each one of her children, if she would perform
all of her task to the full. Therefore there can never be any
end to the teacher’s work of preparation and of laborious application, in the daily work of her school.

IMPROVEMENT OF WORK.

All good teachers are constantly striving to make themselves
better. Most of our teachers have been well trained for their
profession, at college or normal school; yet in many ways they
are at work studying how to improve. ‘The officers of the school
department ought to do all in their power to foster this spirit of
improvement. ‘The teacher who is aspiring to do better things
is worth incomparably more to her school than the teacher who

|

SUPERINTENDENT AND SECRETARY.  
is standing still in her work. That same spirit of aspiration is
passed on to the children. When we cease to learn, we ought to
cease to attempt to teach.

TEACHERS’ MEETINGS.

Under the rules of the Committee general meetings are held
at various times, as found helpful and convenient. At the grade
meetings, more particular attention is paid to the work of the particular grades assembled. These meetings may be expected to be,
and experience shows that they are, of great value for the improvement of our work.

The Teachers’ Association has been formed, to bring us all |
closer together in relations of sympathy and mutual helpfulness.
We hold social meetings for better acquaintance; educational
meetings and lectures for the study of problems of education ;
the banquet is likely to become an annual institution. To all
these meetings the members of the Committee are cordially invited. Other developments, and wider field of usefulness for )

‘ the Teachers’ Association may be clearly foreseen in the not
distant future.

The Amherst Institute is lecture association, largely composed of teachers from various towns and cities in our neighborhood. Lectures have been given at our High School building ;

 the enterprise is proving to be most valuable and successful.
THE SCHOOL SOCIAL CENTER.

In the report of last year the question was raised, whether
the school buildings might not serve for greater usefulness to
the city. ‘This question is now attracting attention and calling
for action, in many different places. Mr. Ossian H. Lang of the
School Journal has given this matter much attention, and hope
that our people may in the near future be enabled to hear and
profit by his advice.

At Elmwood, the Education Society is striving to bring school
and people into closer harmony. The report from Springdale

  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

calls for some opening of the school building in the evening, to
meet the social needs of the district. The question is one of
living importance, and would advise that beginning be made.

The hall at Hamilton street might be opened, from to g
Pp. M., every day. Chairs and tables should be provided, with
papers, magazines, quiet games, and branch of the Public Library. The room opposite the hall could be used for classes in

! light gymnastics. “—The expense would be small. Some one must
be hired of course to protect the property and keep order. Fuel,
lights and janitor’s service would cost something. But how
trifling is this expense in comparison with the inestimable advantage to our young people of finding safe and suitable place
for social recreation! hope that steps may be taken at once
to carry out some such plan. |

ORGANIZATION. )

There are good many different subjects, which. now enter
into the course of studies at school. It is not fairly to be expected that all teachers will be equally good in teaching all
subjects. Our principals are studying constantly, to improve
their plans of organization and of work. One thing that naturally suggests itself is, that teachers be allowed to some extent
to choose the subjects in which. they can do best, and teach
their own subjects in several rooms. ‘This departmental plan.
of work has been carried on to considerable extent in our
schools. In four large schools an extra teacher had been employed,:in order to better divide up the studies. During the
past year we have been obliged to curtail expense, and the
employment of these extra teachers is discontinued. This curtailment is deplored by the principals, as serious lossand detri-  
ment to their work. Promising schemes for broader and higher
work for the pupils have necessarily been dropped. ‘There is
no question but that the work of these schools might be much
better carried on, with these extra teachers. oe

We have still the supervisors in special subjects—music,
drawing, gymnastics, penmanship. All these supervisors are

SUPERINTENDENT AND SECRETARY. 
working faithfully, and in harmony with the teachers; their
reports are appended.

It is believed by many people that little children ought to
go to school for shorter hours. ‘The three-hour day at school is
gaining adherents. There is nothing to be gained by keeping
five-year-old children in school all day. ‘They only learn to be
idle if they worked hard al! the day, it would do them great harm.
For the sake of the children, and also as measure of economy,
I believe that all our schools of first and second grades should

} be organized on the basis of three hours day.
| THE HIGH SCHOOL. |

Our High School is growing still, and will before long fill
every part of the large building. ‘The growth of the school may
be expected to swell especially the departments of Manual T'raining and Commerce. ‘The High School is striving to make itself
useful to the people as well as to the teachers, by the excellent
lectures that have been given, and which hope to see continued.

MANUAL TRAINING. ,
We are doing good work in Manual Training at the High
 School; but we require none of this work in the lower grades,
though the law demands it. Some steps in this matter ought to
be taken at once. One lesson week might be given to pupils
of grades eight and nine; the boys would go to the High School
building, the girls would take sewing, at their own schools. We
need this training. Years ago, the boys got their manual training at home, on the farm or in the shop; our city boys get none
of it. They study books until the mind sickens at books. If
| they only had reasonable proportion of hand-labor to go with
all this book-study, then growth would be far more healthful
and pleasurable because rational. ‘The most idle and inattentive
of boys, being sent to the truant school where there is manual labor, suddenly become studious and tractable. ‘The lesson is
obvious; the boys simply need that kind of work. But it is

  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

rather hard if boy must get himself arrested and sentenced to

the truant school, in order to get the kind of education demanded by the spirit of the times and by his own needs.
PHYSICAL CULTURE.

There are many things about school life, which may not be
helpful to physical growth. Lighting is often defective school
furniture is faulty; ventilation may be bad. The fundamental .
requirement of the school is unnatural, in that it requires children to keep quiet, instead of springing to the active expression
of their thoughts. The very greatest care and wisdom should be
exercised to overcome any such evil tendencies. The net result
of school work in all grades ought to be, to build up bodily
health and strength in every pupil.

Holyoke was one of the first cities to adopt gymnastics in
schools; the work should be carried on and developed year by
year. Some gymnastic apparatus could be placed in the school
halls, thus stimulating interest in such exercises. The out-ofdoor recesses, which have been to some extent discontinued,
should be restored. Active play in the open air is the best gymnastic exercise. At the High School, we ought to have vigorous
and systematic exercise for girls and boys. Our present efficient
supervisor could doubtless plan further development of the
work, and teachers could be selected to carry it out.

NEW BUILDINGS.

We still need new buildings. We all take pride in the fact
that our city is advancing, growing, but we must not forget that :
a part of the increase in wealth that this brings must be spent
for new school houses. At South Holyoke the need is very
pressing. We ought to have eight more rooms there at once,
and we can fill them as soon as they can be ready. At Elm

' street, the Committee has already asked for small separate
building for the school offices. ‘This ought to be provided as
soon as possible. At Oakdale too, the situation will soon imSUPERINTENDENT AND SECRETARY. |
peratively demand new building. There is no new argument
to be advanced for these buildings over what was said last year }
the matter is only the more urgent for year’s delay, and the
children are the sufferers. Too long delay is not economy, but
wastefulness.
IN CONCLUSION.

Buildings and equipment of course are important, but the
one thing needful for successful school is the right kind of a
teacher; we have body of teachers who may be depended
upon for faithful and intelligent work, and who have, as I
believe, the confidence of the Committee and of the people of
the City. With united and earnest purpose, there iseveryreason
to expect that the work of our schools will go on with constant
improvement. ;

The expense fer capita for the support of our schools is less |
than last year; more than dollar has been saved on each
child’s education. The burden to the taxpayer is less; last
year it was  on each dollar of valuation; this year
- on dollar. ‘The School Committee have kept
expenses within the appropriation, while still striving to reach
out for the betterment of the schools. They have sought
to learn from the people in every way, how far the schools are
meeting the needs of the situation and where improvement is
suggested, the attempt is made to carry it out.

With acknowledgement of the unfailing courtesy and helpfulness of the committee, 

Respectfully submitted,
LOUIS P. NASH.

REPORT OF THE

SUPERVISOR OF DRAWING.
Mr. Louts P. Nash, Superintendent of Schools.

Dear Sir :—The art instruction in our schools has been car, ried on, for the most part, along the same lines as during the
preceding year. Much good work has been done and usually ,
under favorable conditions; it is evident, however, that the intermediate grades have suffered from lack of time, and this being
the case it necessarily follows that the standard of results must

, be lowered in all grades above them.

Grades IV, and VI are allowed only one hour week
which is altogether too short time in which to accomplish all
that seems desirable in this department, and it would certainly
be unreasonable to expect that our work in these grades could
compare favorably with that from other cities where two and

, even four hours week are devoted to this subject. earnestly
hope that the question as to more time for drawing in grades
IV, and VI may be taken into consideration.

Remarks are frequently made which seem to indicate that
many people still have an idea that drawing is taught in our
schools only for the purpose of developing artistic ability and
consequently if pupil’s progress is not such as to warrant the
hope that he will in time be able to draw or paint beautiful pictures his art study is to be considered failure.

| This is far from being the case and it ought to be distinctly
understood that it is not the chief end and aim of art instruction
in the public schools to produce artists.

It is gratifying, to be sure, when this result occasionally follows but the number of pupils who can ever hope to gain disSUPERVISOR OF DRAWING.  
tinction as artists is so small compared with the whole number
of pupils in the schools, that if this were the only end in view I
should be among the very first to admit that it was mistake to
require pupils as whole to spend valuable time on what could
benefit only few of them. Ihe hoped-for results to be secured
by art education, however, are so much broader in scope and :
will be of such practical value to every child and future citizen,
that am confident the mistake would consist in omitting this
subject from the school curriculum or by failing to allow suffcient time for its development.

The pupils whose results are the most discouraging from an
artistic standpoint are perhaps the very ones who will profit
most by the instruction given, and they certainly are the ones
who have most need of it as preparation for their future work
in life whatever that may be. lack of ability to do accurate
intelligent work will prove drawback all through life, while
the trained eye and hand can always command employment.

If it could be fully realized that drawing or art education is
the only subject taught in the various grades of the Holyoke
schools that deals directly with this training of the eye and
hand, training that will prove to be of so much practical value
to the pupil in after life, it does seem as if its importance would
be more highly appreciated than is sometimes the case. We
have thus far been considering the matter only from utilitarian
point of view, but art education has also an zxsthetic value, aside
from the development of artistic talent, on account of its leading
pupils to see and appreciate the beautiful in nature and art
whereby so much of interest and pleasure is added to life.

The success that has attended the efforts of several of the
school principals to obtain works of art for the decoration of 
their buildings will aid greatly in the endeavor to awaken in
their pupils an appreciation of good art. Holyoke is fast gaining an enviable reputation for the generosity with which her
citizens have responded to appeals of this kind. For several
years the Appleton Street School has been famous for its fine
collection of pictures, and now the beautiful new Highland building has been adorned with so large and carefully selected col  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

lection that it is attracting attention from all over the country.
Pictures have also been placed in many other buildings and
efforts are being made to obtain more funds for the same purpose.

The pupils are fortunate indeed who are thus brought in
daily contact with so many of these fine reproductions of the
masterpieces of: art. They will, unconsciously, be influenced
more or less by them and higher standard of art and beauty
will be developed in their minds than would otherwise be the
case.

Regular visits to the schools have been made, as usual,
throughout the year by the Supervisor and Assistant Supervisor,

but it is very evident that as the schools increase in number,
| less of their time can be given to any one school than has before
been the case, and in consequence the teachers’ meetings become
of more and more importance. ‘These meetings are held once a
week for the purpose of discussing the required work in drawing, but they are so planned that the teachers of each grade are
expected to be present only once month. Directions for
future work are given at each meeting and am sure that teachers who attend regularly find them helpful.

Much excellent work has been done in the High School
along many different lines. It was pleasure in looking over
some back numbers of The Herald ”’ recently, to see how much
satisfactory original work had been done for the school paper
in the way of designing its covers, head and tail-pieces and
other illustrations. Independence and originality were plainly
evident.

The Holyoke School Board certainly has right to expect
good results, considering the many advantages that are afforded
to pupils in the city schools; but while the work now accomplished here will compare favorably with that done in other
cities under similar conditions, there are always possibilities
ahead that act as an incentive to further endeavor.

Thanking the Superintendent and the members of the School
Board for their interest and support, and my fellow-teachers for
their cordial co-operation.

Respectfully submitted,
ISABELLE H. FERRY.

REPORT OF THE
SUPERVISOR OF PENMANSHIP.
Mr. Louts P. Nash, Superintendent of Schools.

DEAR SIR :—

The Department of Penmanship will always be an interesting
one, on account of the utility and practicability of this branch
of education. It gives me pleasure to note the interest dis played by the parents, who express great satisfaction when success is attained by their children. On entering our new school
year, we continued the use of the Vertical System of writing
until September, when Smith’s Intermedial System was substituted. The style of writing is clear, the letters simple and
business-like, and the slant enough to admit of speed. We are
now endeavoring with heart and will to make this writing
successful in our schools, and have reason to hope for ultimate
success. Expressing my appreciation of the kindness and
courtesy shown me by those connected with me in my work,

Respectfully submitted,

ESTHER A. MacDONNELL.

REPORT OF THE
DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL
TRAINING.
, Mr. Louis P. Nash, Superintendent of Schools. .

Dear Sir:—As Director of Physical Training it becomes a
pleasant duty to report to you the general condition of this
department.

This part of education is, beyond all doubt, one of the
grandest gifts to our youth in the public schools, and enough

| cannot be done for this branch of education, in order to promote and sustain the physical and mental well-being.

In teaching gymnastics, we must, in our public schools,
concern ourselves not with the development of the bodies only,
but also with the development and implanting of the spirit of
the true, genuine physical exercises, and of the American
national character, so much indeed, so, that this spirit may
grow true to itself, pure in its character and strong in its vigor,
and that it will not only be preserved for ourselves, but imparted
to the entire population.

Since physical training has become part of school curriculum, it has gained ground, advancing from year to year, and has
| been crowned by good results, since the scholars have taken a
liking to gymnastics, and very many of the scholars realize the
benefit to themselves, derived from gymnastics. Likewise, the
public is now beginning to realize the value of bodily exercises

in our school education.

I wish to state, that during the last year the teachers have
done considerable work, and from what have seen, the interest

PHYSICAL TRAINING  ,
in the work has been greater than at any other time. The ,
scholars, also, have done splendid work, and but few are excused
from the work, circumstances being such that it was impossible
todo so. The discipline as whole was very good. In regard
to the time for gymnastics and other details, call attention to |
my last year’s report. |
I desire at this time to thank you as Superintendent, members of the School Board, principals and teachers, for your
co-operation in my efforts to develop what is noblest and best,
and that we shall all need to work harmoniously together in the
future as in the past, for the benefit of the youth of our schools. |

REPORT OF THE
SUPERVISOR OF MUSIC.
Mr. Louts P. Nash, Superintendent of Schools.
DEaR SIR :— }

Another year has been recorded in our school work and it is
with satisfaction that can report that there has been forward movement, that the pupils of the various grades are able
to read music more readily than in previous years. During the
winter gave concert at the High School Auditorium with the
aid of the Ninth Grades, each school having class song with a
grand chorus of about three hundred. large audience was
present who showed much interest in the singing of the pupils.

The Graduation exercises were successful, singing taking a
very prominent part.

HIGH SCHOOL.

During the earlier part of the year we used sheet music of a
miscellaneous order. For Graduation we had chorus of one
hundred and fifty voices, singing Noyes’ Village
Blacksmith,” work of great beauty, which was enjoyed by
those who sung, and audience.

A Glee Club has been running through the year for the
benefit of those who wished to sing. For the last year we have
had music elective, and although it works very well, think
there are vast number who ought to take music who make the
excuse: lack of Study Periods.

After giving music for seven years in the schools as study,

SUPERVISOR OF MUSIC.  
there should be more singing in the High School and would
suggest for the consideration of the School Committee that we
divide the school into two choruses, taking the Senior and Junior,
Sophomore and Freshman, making two choruses of about three
hundred each, giving one period week to each which Principal
Akers says could be done without interfering with the other
studies.

I now wish to return my thanks to Principals and Teachers
for their support. Thanking you and School Committee for |
your support,

Respectfully submitted,
HUGH CRAIG.

HIGH SCHOOL.
Mr. Louis P. Nash, Superintendent of Schools.

Dear Sir :—In reply to your request for the annual report
of the principal, the following statements and suggestions are
submitted.

Seventy-six pupils were graduated in June. The list given
in the appendix indicates by addresses the number pursuing

| school work this year.

The enrollment this year to Nov. has been  The
pupils are distributed in the various departments in approximately the same proportions as during the past two years. The
increase of work in the business department makes it necessary
to assign double classes four times per week, and to cut down
the number of periods that should be given to penmanship. It
will be impossible to carry on properly the work of this depart- ,
ment another year without an assistant teacher. In the Manual
Training Department, also, we are able to give but six periods
of mechanical drawing per week to meet an actual demand for
eight. If there is the usual increase in the election of this
work, the services of an assistant teacher will be needed in this
department. Possibly one teacher could be secured to assist in
the elementary work of both departments.

The healthful spirit of the school organizations has been

| shown during the year by the contribution of several pictures.
The girls’ club has given “Sir Galahad,” by Watts; the dramatic club, two copies of the pyramids; the Herald, ‘The
Torrent,” by Ruysdael; also the “Jungfrau,” Canterbury
Cathedral,” Litchfield Cathedral,” ‘‘Reims Cathedral,” and
photographs of George Washington and Lady Washington from
the Stuart paintings in the Boston Museum; some members of

HIGH SCHOOL. es:
the class of  “Song of the Lark,” by Breton; and Mr.
Scott, of the faculty, has given “Boy with Mandolin,” by Carpaccio. In all, these organizations have contributed during the
year about  for pictures. While we should welcome any
gifts of pictures from friends of the school, we appreciate the
peculiar sentiment attaching to pictures contributed by the |
pupils themselves. .
The year has seen no innovation in the method of work, in
the program, or in the course of study. The effort of the
teachers has been directed toward improving the work of the
school under the course of study and program adopted last year. )
Slight modifications will inevitably suggest themselves as the ,
result of experience, and in the line of progress. These modifications will not be adopted to give variety or newness to school
work, but because they are more effective for good results. ,
 The year opens with the organization of the school well in
hand, and working effectively, and the school spirit especially
pleasant. But in both of these directions constant oversight is
necessary. ‘Eternal vigilance is the price of success” here.
There are, however, some problems connected with our schools,
greater than the mere working of daily program, and that
more seriously affect the moral and intellectual life of our pupils
than daily recitations. If our school is to realize for the community the most of which it is capable, these problems should,
in our Opinion, receive early consideration. In speaking of two
or three of these we wish to be understood as not arguing for |
the curtailment of the rights and privileges of any individual
pupil or citizen, but for what seems to us the advantage both of
those against whom discrimination may, at first thought, seem
to be made, and for the school and community.
In the first place, we believe closer scrutiny should be made
of our membership. Undoubtedly many enter our High School
for no higher purpose than to avoid honest occupation, and, as
long as they remain, idle their time in way that is harmful to
themselves, hindrance to class progress, and vicious in its example to other pupils. They are irregular and unpunctual in
attendance, and often truant; impertinent and vulgar in lan  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
guage, and often dishonest. They are careless in the use of
school property, books, and supplies. They are thus not only
cultivating in themselves dispositton for uselessness, and confirming habits of idleness, but are robbing other pupils of conditions that make for the best progress, and contaminating them
by their evil example. In many cases parents admit their inability to control them, and wish us to punish them. But we
lack the coercive power of reformatory. It is difficult thing
to say that any boy or any girl shall not enter our public schools, .
but it is only the part of duty and justice to them and their parents, to say that they shall not remain, when it is evident that to
do so is harm to themselves. They get nothing from an educational standpoint by attending, while they are learning to disregard the rights of others, and to scorn honest work. By
allowing them to continue in this indifferent, idle, lawless condition, we are sacrificing possible chances of making useful citizens, of them. Could they be placed in school by themselves,
and compelled, by military discipline, to meet duty and do the
right, undoubted good would result in many cases. But these
are the conditions of reform school, and should not, and can
not, obtain in public high school, where all must be controlled
by general regulations. It may be argued that their negative
. morality is an advantage as warning example. While it may
arouse the contempt of few of the strong, it will lure in its own
way many of the weak. The school will never be free to do its
best work for the community until some restriction is placed
upon the possibility of its being made morning loafing place
for pupils who spend the remainder of their time on the streets
in various forms of disorder and vice.

A second problem that should, we believe, receive further
attention is the question of school athletics. In accordance
with the authority granted by your Committee, membership upon
athletic teams playing under the name of the High School, is
made dependent upon the doing of specified amount of school
work. It is our opinion that the school as whole accepts this
condition as distinct advantage to all. As further advantage, we believe that the hours of contests should be so arranged

HIGH SCHOOL.  
as not to conflict with school work. In other words, that no
pupil should be excused from any part of school session to —
take part in an athletic contest. The pupils who are members
of our athletic teams can not afford this loss of time. Moreover,
while we tolerate this neglect of school work, parents assume
that it has our approval, and are deceived into thinking that
their children can be absent without any loss. Others criticise
us for giving sports precedence over school work. In this connection, also, we think that no trip should be made by any
school organization unless the pupils are accompanied by some
member of the faculty, or by mature person approved by them. |
While this latter point is matter that should be insisted on by
the parents of the pupils, yet they trust to our guarding the
moral welfare of their children in everything that goes on under
the name of the school. There is grave moral danger in
allowing school boys to go away without the oversight of some
interested mature person. We believe that the interest and
moral safety of our pupils will be better safeguarded, if we are
authorized by your Committee to regulate our sports in some
such way as indicated above. :

Finally, we wish to call attention to the prevalence of the
habit of smoking among the school boys. It is not necessary to
repeat the generally accepted belief of its moral, physical, and
intellectual harm. Probably fifty per cent. of the boys in the
High School use tobacco in some form. Some are unfitted for
any serious intellectual work. They have smoked out both will
power and ambition. While it would be impossible to absolutely prevent smoking on the part of the pupils, owing to the
fact that they are for so much of the time beyond our control,
yet it can doubtless be limited somewhat by insisting that they
present themselves free from offensive odor of tobacco. In some
cities in Massachusetts, pupils are, by school regulations forbidden, under penalty of suspension, to smoke while going to and
from school. We believe that in the crusade against this evil,
the school should take leading part. We believe also, that we
not only have the legal right to make restrictions, but that the

  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
sentiment of parents and the community would be heartily in
accord with such action on our part.

We do not wish to leave the impression that these are new
and growing evils, threatening the school. On the contrary we
believe that the personnel and spirit of the school is to-day better than at any time during the past two years. But these matters have given way in previous reports to other needs, and are
mentioned now to indicate lines along which most needed improvement may be made. We believe we should not be satisfied
simply with having the school work go on smoothly. If there
is more that we can do for our pupils, we should attempt it, notwithstanding it may involve some unpleasant features. These
questions concern the noblest manhood—self respect, honor
and honesty, healthy bodies and minds—the best possible equipment with which our pupils may be sent from school into active
life.

Thanking you and your Committee for continued and valuable assistance.

Respectfully submitted,
W. C. AKERS.

During the year ending July rst,  go complaints were
issued for truancy; were committed to the Truant School.
Seven were placed on probation and had their cases continued
from time to time. We now have boys at the Truant
School in Springfield and at the Lyman School.

  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
LAW OF  .
|  According to Section  Chapter  of the Acts of  ,
Truant Officers may visit the factories, workshops and mercantile establishments in their several cities and towns and ascertain whether any minors are employed therein contrary to the
provisions of the Act. During the year we made one visit to
the several manufacturing and mercantile establishments. In
most cases we were very courteously received, but in one or two
places we were not allowed to go through the establishment.
Except in those cases we found that the law was being strictly
observed.
We issued employments certificates during the year to
- minors under fifteen years of age.
Before closing our report we wish to recommend to your
Honorable Board the appointment of one or two additional
Truant Officers, not only on account of the increased number of
pupils, but especially on account of the spreading of the city,
making it extremely difficult to cover the ground to which our
 work takes us, and making it impossible to give to each school
the attention it should receive.
Thanking your Honorable Board for the favors conferred
upon us during the year, we remain,
Respectfully submitted,
T. W. DOYLE,
EDWARD CADIEUX.

REPORT OF THE  
BOARD OF HEALTH.
To the Honorable the Mayor, and Board of Aldermen.

GENTLEMEN:—In compliance with the Public Statutes, the
Board of Health herewith respectfully submit for your consideration the twenty-first annual report.

The Board met for organization on the first Monday in February, electing the following officers: Chairman, Ir. Arthur B.
Wetherell Secretary, Dr. Frank A. Woods; Health Officer, Mr.
Jeremiah J. Linehan; Clerk, Mr. Joseph A. Murray.

| GENERAL WORK.

: The general work of keeping the city clean requires much
more time, care and attention by the members of the Board than
is evident to any one who does not take especial interest in the
work and thus look into the subject. Much of this work lies in
abating small nuisances which affect only the localities in which
they exist.

Dirty cellars, tenements and other buildings and stores come }
under this head, and upon this work, many times, depends the
health of the locality. This tenement work not only tends to
directly decrease the mortality, but is great aid in the prevention of epidemics.

We would request that each property owner see that his tenements and their surroundings are kept in clean and sanitary

,

  REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH.

condition. This would greatly aid the Board in this very important work of keeping the city clean. ‘The appended report

of the Health Officer gives detailed report of this work.
BACTERIOLOGY.

During the past year the Board have continued the system
of bacteriological examinations in all cases of diphtheria or of
throat trouble of suspicious nature. Dr. H. C. Emerson of ,
Springtield was again elected bacteriologist of the Board.

The Board would urge each physician to exercise due care
and promptness in taking swabs for diagnosis, and also in taking
the two consecutive negative swabs for release before the quarantine can be raised, as caution against the spread of contagion.

BAKERIES.

Such yearly inspections of bakeries and their surroundings as
is prescribed by law have been made. ‘Taken as whole, these
important places, wher® so much of our food product is manufactured, were found to be in good general condition. ‘wentysix bakeries are at present in operation in the city. ‘The Board
endeavors to use its influence against the establishment of cellar
bakeries, and such advice is being favorably taken in all new
establishments.

| UNDERTAKERS.

The usual licenses have been granted undertakers to carry
on the business as required by law. ‘I'welve licenses were
granted to engage in the business. ‘he undertakers are endeavoring to be prompt in filing certificates of death, and are careful in making their returns. .

Special returns th regard to persons dying of diseases of a
contagious nature have been promptly returned in most cases.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH.  
SLAUGHTER HOUSES.

All slaughter houses and manufactories of sausage and prepared meat within the city have now been granted licenses by
this Board. Nine licenses have been granted for the manufacture of sausage and prepared meat, and two for slaughtering.

The supervision of these places of business of those thus |
engaged, thus entailed, has caused an improvement in the
character of the articles furnished to the public for consumption.

The Inspector of Meat and Provisions has worked in full
co-operation with the Board, and as result there is less diseased |
meat exposed for sale. Under the new statute all animals must
be inspected before they are killed and the meat must be subsequently stamped by the inspector. ‘There have been four prosecutions during the past year for selling diseased meat; conviction being secured in all cases. |

FRUIT AND VEGETABLES. ,
 The Board continue to wage war on poor fruit and vegetables
furnished to the public. ‘here have been seven prosecutions of
peddlers for selling decayed fruit or vegetables that in all cases
have been brought in from outside of the city; all of whom
were convicted.

The appended report of the Health Officer gives detail of
this work and of the fruit condemned during the year. .

, INSPECTION OF SECOND-HAND DEALERS AND
JUNK DEALERS.

We would again recommend that smaller number of
licenses be granted to dealers in these lines of business. An
inspection of the proposed places of business should be made
in all cases, and the applications referred to this Board before a
license is granted. ,

t REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH.

In no case should milk or any food product be allowed to be
sold on the premises where such business is conducted.
INSPECTOR OF MILK, VINEGAR AND PETROLEUM.

As was recommended last year, the Inspector of Milk was
placed under this Board, but only to the extent of the inspection
of milk. ‘This act sub-divides his duties. The Board would
recommend that an ordinance be passed placing the Inspector
of Milk, Vinegar and Petroleum under this Board, that suitable salary be fixed for him, and that all fees from his department revert to the city treasury. It would also recommend
that it provide for an assistant or collector, as provided by
law, and that it provide for salary for him of  day for
each day employed.

| BARNS AND LIVERY STABLES.

All applications for the erection or use of buildings as barns
or livery stables have received careful consideration and the
: sites of locations have been inspected before granting licenses.

License for the construction and use of such have been granted
with but few exceptions. People are becoming more familiar
with this law, and there is less tendency for the evasion of the
same noted.

PLUMBERS.

‘The Board of Plumbing Examiners have examined all candidates referred to them by this Board for examination. There
have been three applications made to the Board for journeymen
plumbers’ licenses, and two for master plumbers’ licenses during
the past twelve months, all of which have been granted. The
report of the Board of Plumbing Examiners is appended.

| REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH.  Y
SANITARY INSPECTION.

The Board can report that the work in this division of its
department has been carried on in athorough manner. Mr.
Frank L. Avery was appointed Plumbing Inspector on June
  of this year.

The report of the Plumbing Inspector shows that there has
been more new work done in the city during the past year than
in the preceding twelve months, which, with the addition of the
large amount of old work replaced and the required tests, have
necessitated large number of inspections. house-to-house
inspection of plumbing is an urgent necessity, and the Board
would again recommend that special appropriation be made,
and the work commenced early in the year.

Appended is the report of the Inspector of Plumbing.

: VAULTS AND CESSPOOLS.

The Board has continued its endeavors to have all of the old
vaults and cesspools removed wherever the sewer privileges
would permit, the few remaining vaults being due to lack of
these.

The Board would recommend that lateral sewers be laid on
Main street, north and south from Berkshire street on Dwight
street, north from Nonotuck street; that some provision be
made for the east side of North Summer street, and for the south
end of Laurel street and Gates street.

The condition of drainage of the houses at Ingleside should |
also receive serious consideration at once. |

SEWERS AND DRAINS.

The Board is unanimous in the opinion that no sewage
should be allowed to enter the river above the dam, and any
such plan will be strenuously opposed. The Walnut street sewer

  REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH.
is also the cause of much complaint, property owners claiming
that it is not only nuisance but an injury to their property.
This Board considers it source of filth and danger to the
| public health, and would request that the sewer be changed
according to the plans already prepared by the City Engineer.
- The Board desires to recommend that al] catch basins be frequently cleaned and flushed, especially during the hot weather.
The Board would also recommend that an ordinance be passed
requiring that inspection of all sewers, from the building line to
houses, be made by the Inspector of Plumbing, and that all such
sewers and drains be laid only by licensed drain layers or
licensed plumbers. VITAL STATISTICS.

In this branch gf the work the Board is constantly endeavoring to bring the standard of its office up to that of the
Boards of Statistics in the larger cities. This year in addition
to gradual extension of the system we have purchased “card
index system upon which all of the statistics of the department will be placed and which when completed will place them
in practical form for ready use. ,

The following statistics for the year ending November  oth,
 Show total death in the city during the year of  a
death-rate of per cent per thousand population, and  
still-births. [his compares very favorably with the preceding
year when there were deaths, death-rate of per cent
per thousand and still-births, which shows reduction of  

| deaths and per cent per thousand in the death-rate, over
 .

The appended “Table A” shows the comparative number of
deaths, still-births and death-rates for the ten years to
 got inclusive; also the average death-rate for the ten years.

‘Table B” presents the deaths and still-births by months,

: showing that the mortality has run very even through-out the
year with the exception of the month of July when the extreme

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH.  
heat had its effect upon the infants of the city; over per
cent of the deaths of this month being of children under one
year of age. |

“Table C” shows that of the deaths reported during the
year, were males and females, and of the still-births
  were males and were females.

“Table D” gives the deaths by sex and age, showing that of
the total deaths,  or per cent were under one year
of age;  or per cent had been under five years of age,
and  or per cent had been over fifty years of age, and
also showing the males and females dying at each age.

“Table E”’ presents the exact cause of each death occurring
in the city during the past year. It shows decrease in deaths
caused from diseases of contagious nature, and also slight
decrease in those dying from diseases of the digestive system.

In diseases of the respiratory tract there is little or no proportionate change, while there had been an increase in deaths
from violent causes. ,

“Table F”’ is new table this year, showing the number of

 deaths in the institutions, and in the various wards, with the
per cent per thousand inhabitants in each ward. ‘This is very
valuable table, as it aids in determining the amount of sickness .
in each ward, indicating the health conditions that there exist.
As will readily be seen, the death rate runs higher in the tenement districts, such as exist in Wards One, Two and Four,
while it decreases in the districts where the population is not so
crowded.

Seventeen and sixty-nine one hundredths per cent of the
total deaths of the city occur in the institutions.

In “Table G” will be seen the nativity of those dying in the
city during the past year. Of the deaths,  or  
per cent, were born in Holyoke;  or per cent, in the
United States;  or per cent, were born in Ireland; Or per cent, in Canada;  or per cent, in Germany;  or per cent, in England;  or per cent, in
Scotland, and the remainder in various other foreign countries.

There have been bodies brought to Holyoke for burial

  REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH.
during the past year, and sent from the city for burial; —
there have been local burials. Nine hundred and ninety
burial permits have been issued from this office during the year.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH.  
, CONTAGIOUS DISEASES.

The year ending November  rgor while showing decrease of nearly per cent in the total number of diseases of
a contagious nature, has been marked by steady run of these
diseases throughout the year, which, however, has at no time
assumed the proportions of an epidemic in any line. ‘The majority of the cases of contagious nature have been of mild
character, and hence it is our pleasure not only to report decrease in the number of each disease, but also decrease in the
death rate from each of these causes.

In smallpox alone we have to report an increase over the

| previous year; last year we escaped without case of this disease, but this year we have to report two cases, both of light
type, there being no fatalities. Both cases were discovered
early in the disease, before the exposure of many had been possible; quarantine was quickly established, one being quarantined
at his home, and the other sent to the pest-house; vaccination
of all possibly exposed persons was quickly done, and the reports so controlled that there was little feeling of apprehension
throughout the city. No new cases developed from these cases.

During the year ending November go there have been
reported in the city cases of disease of contagious nature,
with deaths, as compared with cases, with deaths
reported the preceding year.

Of these diseases Diphtheria easily leads the list with  
cases. ‘This disease has been very steady in its appearance in 
every month of the year. No part of the city has been free
from this disease although the lower part of ward has sutfered
the most.

The total this year has been cases with deaths, a
death-rate of per cent, as compared with cases with
  deaths, death-rate of per cent reported during the
preceding year. ;

There have been cases of Scarlet Fever with deaths,
a death-rate of per cent as compared with cases with
  deaths, death-rate of per cent for the previous twelve

months. This disease has also been present throughout the }
year and has been located in all parts of the city, ward again |
suffering the most from the disease. |
The number of cases of Measles has decreased over two- .
thirds of those reported during  there having been only
  cases with one death, death-rate of  per cent as compared with cases with deaths, death-rate of per
cent. That these cases have been of light character is evident
from the low death-rate; the greater part of them occured from
February to June and they largely in wards three, seven and six
relatively.
There have been reported cases of Membranous Croup
with deaths, death-rate of per cent as compared with  
cases with  deaths, death-rate of per cent, reported
during  }
Typhoid Fever has not been quite as prevalent as last year, i
a large majority of the cases being traceable to causes outside {
of the city. ‘here have been cases reported with deaths,

CONTAGIOUS DISEASE HOSPITAL. |
For the past three years the Board have recommended that
preparations be made to erect in the near future hospital for
the care of diseases of contagious nature. The demands for
such hospital are becoming more and more pressing each year,
and the Board wish to again recommend that immediate steps
be taken to obtain site for such building, and that the erec tion of it be done as soon as possible.
Such building would be indispensable should an epidemic
of diphtheria or scarlet fever break out in our tenement districts,
and it would not only aid this Board to cope with such an outbreak, but would doubtless be the cause of saving the lives of

" REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH.  
many of the children that would be affected in such an epidemic
' if they could be taken to some such institution and receive the
advantage of proper care, both from medicinal and surgical
: standpoint, and also from hygienic measures.

REPORT OF THE HEALTH OFFICER.
To the Board of Health,

GENTLEMEN:—This report represents the work of the Health
Officer for the past year, showing the number of persons notified
to make changes in their property and the removal of nuisances
from their premises. During the past year have: found it necessary to take legal action against seven persons for violation of
the health rules, who had previous warning, for selling decayed
fruit and vegetables and three for decayed meat, conviction
being secured in each case.

I have continued to wage war on the sale of poor meat and
vegetables. In almost all cases these products have come from
outside of the city. think there is now decided improve- |
ment in the meat, fruit and vegetables sold in this city.

I wish to congratulate the Board on the removal of so many
old buildings, the total being twenty-six, especially the old Fuller building on Oliver st t, which has been menace to life
and health for number of years.

Other duties performed by your officer are sufficiently set
forth in the accompanying tables. Several verbal and minor
complaints have been attended to, which were not of sufficient
importance to enter upon the records.

REPORT OF THE BACTERIOLOGIST.
Lo the Board of Health, City of Holvoke:

I have the honor to submit the following report for twentythree months ending November gor.

In the early part of January  was employed by the
Board to conduct the bacteriological examinations of cases of
diphtheria occurring in the City of Holyoke. According to the
rules of the Board of Health, free diagnosis of all doubtful cases
of diphtheria was hereby provided, and release from quarantine
of diphtheria cases was to be obtained after the examination
of two consecutive negative cultures. ‘lo carry out these regulations the Board of Health has been supplied with boxes of
sterile swabs, which have been distributed to many of the drug
stores in Holyoke for the convenience of the physicians. (A
sterile swab consists of wire wound at one end with cotton inclosed in glass test tube, stoppered with cotton—all of which
have been sterilized by dry heat.) The laboratory has been
notified whenever there were swabs left for examination at the
City Hall before p. m., and messenger from the laboratory
makes regular collections of these boxes, and the Board of
Health has been notified of the results of the examinations
about a. m. on the following morning.

During the twenty-three months there have been referred to
me for examination primary cases for diagnosis, and  
primary cases for release, making total of cases examined.
Of the cases for diagnosis were positive,—that is, diphtheria
bacilli were present, and cases were negative, showing
absence of diphtheria bacilli, while showed no growth of any
organism. “no growth” report gives absolutely no correct
knowledge of the presence or absence of the germs of diphtheria,

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH.  
and is consequently valueless as means of diagnosis in doubtful case, or as evidence of proper condition for release ina 
convalescent case. Many of the cultures that showed this absence of any organisms on the first trial gave either positive or
negative results on secondary examinations. word should be
said concerning the very high number of no growth cultures recorded above. Nearly per cent of them occurred during the
months of December  goo, and January  go and the others in
the immediate vicinity of these dates. No change had been
made in the service in any way and yet culture after culture
gave absolutely no growth. Careful investigation gave no clue
as to the cause of the trouble, which gradually ceased, and there
has been no recurrence of it.

‘There has been steady increase in the number of cultures
taken for release in positive cases, and the value of this procedure has been clearly demonstrated. In number of cases
the diphtheria germs have persisted for several weeks, and nine
or ten cultures have been submitted in each case.

Below will be found in tabular form, the classification and
summaries of the work accomplished.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF
PARK. COMMISSIONERS.
To His Honor the, Mayor, and Board of Aldermen.
 GENTLEMEN :— Agreeable to the requirements of the Legislature and the established usage, the Park Commission have the
honor to submit herewith their annual report, covering the work
accomplished in the public parks of the City of Holyoke during
the past year. It covers in detail more than in previous years,
as well as forcibly showing the absolute wants in the department, all of which we trust will have your favorable consideration.
This Board has held numerous meetings, and devoted much
time to the personal supervision, care and maintenance of the
parks, visiting them often, studying their needs and possibilities.
The Board believes that the year’s record of improvement
has contributed not little to their beauty and development,
and that they are more attractive and popular than ever before,
and that the parks have now hundreds of new friends and admirers, who will find continued and more abundant pleasure in
the enjoyment of the privileges afforded. It is an established
fact that nothing is more conducive to the general health of the :
city, or to the elevation of the morals of the people, than these
open green spots, abounding in nature and the beautiful. ‘The
city, however, is lacking in the very limited number that they
have, and the smallness of them, and it is very evident that
more and larger tracts will be necessary in the near future.
 That the city is far behind others in the area of parks is shown
by statements from the park census, Holyoke having only one
acre to every inhabitants, while Hartford has one acre

  REPORT OF THE PARK COMMISSIONERS.

to every inhabitants, Springfield one acre to every inhabitants, Worcester one acre to every inhabitants, Providence
one acre to every inhabitants, Boston one acre to every  
inhabitants, and New Bedford one acre to about every  
inhabitants.

The Board have been able to accomplish but little beside
the regular maintenance on account of the small appropriation
at their disposal; consequently, many things were left undone
which this Board would like to have had done. They have in
contemplation the establishing of sanitaries on the principal
parks for both sexes. The Department is very much in need of
a suitable building for the storage of. their tools, settees, etc.

It has been our aim to make every dollar of our appropriation accomplish the greatest possible good for the great number
of people who derive pleasure and profit from our limited number of parks, and the problem of developing our main public
ground with the limited resources at our disposal, without neglecting the proper care and preservation of those portions
already improved, has been difficult and trying one. We have,
however, made start toward developing this main park by
securing the advice of one of the most prominent landscape
architects, whose report is submitted later on, and we hope to
be able to carry out some of his recommendations during the
coming year.

We submit herewith our report covering the receipts and expenditures on the various parks for the past year:

present time, and believing it to be of the most importance that
the right start should be made in the development of this beautiful spot, the Board deemed it advisable to secure the assistance and advice of those who were most familiar with this class
of work, and who have made life study of the treatment of

  REPORT OF THE PARK COMMISSIONERS.
such places. In their preliminary report they have outlined the
possibilities of development of the park in manner which
encourages us to hope for most gratifying results, with the cooperation of your Board in the way of appropriation to carry
out their scheme of development; and we hope, in the near
future, to show to our citizens beauty spot of which they may
justly be proud, and from which they may derive much pleasure.
During the past year the Board have planted about trees
and soo shrubs. ‘They have added new settees, built new
rustic bridge across the ravine, repaired and made new walks,
and have added several new flower beds. The have also graded
the front plot on Maple street, which is decided improvement
over the previous condition, this work being the beginning of
the development of the ravine section. ‘There is an urgent demand for more walks in this park for the accommodation of the
people passing through the park who live on the highest section
of the city. We hope to build these walks during the coming
year.

. The Board deem it advisable to secure the tract of land ad| joining Elmwood Park on the north-west side, known as the
Ranlet land, which can probably be secured at the present time
on more favorable terms than at any time in the future.
HAMPDEN PARK.

This is one of the most important of our Parks, and one
which is patronized by the largest number of citizens, being in
the center of the City and the center of thoroughfare from all
quarters; it being of so limited an area must of necessity be
limited in its development. It can however be made very attractive by liberal use of shrubs and by adornment with bright
flowers. ‘This year the Board have made improvements and additions by placing large beds of shrubs and flowers in the center
of the park, which, when they get well started should make a
very pleasing effect. They have also put in shrubbery in the
various corners of the park and have added iron fences to protect the same. On account of the great number of trees and the

dense foliage it has been difficult to make any great growth in
the way of flowers and shrubs, but by judicious trimming of
the same, which the Board have done this Fall, it has added
greatly to the appearance: of the park and will help much towards
allowing fuller development of the shrubbery, and it is the intention of the Board to make further additions during the coming year. They have also provided an additionnal supply of —
settees. It is also intended to erect suitable drinking fountains
to take the place of the unsightly water tank and house now on
the park, and it is also their desire to erect sanitary for men
and suitable building with conveniences for women and
children. |
PROSPECT PARK.

This is one of the prettiest breathing spots that we have.
The situation is delightful, the view charming. Thousands of
people gather here on summer evenings to avoid the heat of the
city. cool breeze from the river makes great change in the
atmosphere, and scores of mothers with their young children
flock here to take advantage of Nature’s changes. ‘The work of
beautifying this pretty spot with shrubs and flowers has commenced, and it is the intention of the Board to make further
additions during the coming year. The Board has also in contemplation the making of playground for children by setting
aside portion of the north end, and providing it with the various swings, merry-go-rounds, etc., which go to make much happiness and entertainment for the youngsters; and, also, of providing wading pool for the younger element. The Board
has also in contemplation the removal of the unsightly fence
which now runs along the edge of the park on the railway side,
and substituting this with suitable stone wall, which will not
only be an ornament and finish to the park site, but will be |
safeguard to the many young children who are there at all times ;
and will also allow the embankments to be planted with shrubs
and vines, making pleasing approach and appearance from
the railroad side. In this development they hope for the co-operation of the railroad officials.

  REPORT OF THE PARK COMMISSIONERS.
CANONCHET PARK.
This park is at present in very unsuitable condition and it
has been problem with the Board how to improve and develop
it without the expenditure of considerable money. From the
nature of the soil, and the location of the park, it is almost impossible to make anything grow in flourishing condition. The .
Board however intend to make an effort to beautify it somewhat
by planting some shrubs and flowers and also by putting in
concrete walks all through the park. ‘They have this year rebuilt the terraces on the three sides and intend to rebuild the
terrace on the west side the coming year. New settees have
been added and minor other improvements made. The Board
are, however, of the opinion that it would not be advisable to
spend any large sums in the development of this park.
HAMILTON PARK.

This park is small but very attractive and is patronized and.
enjoyed by many living in that section of the city. It is, however, altogether too small for requirements, and being so small
there is little chance to make any further improvements.

| GERMANIA PARK. ,

| This park is so largely patronized on the warm summer evenings that there is not room for all who would like to share it and
demonstrates the necessity of larger area to satisfy the demands of the residents of this section. Is is triangle plot of
less than an acre and thickly planted with trees, so that there is
not much chance for beautifying the same. generous allowance of settees and good walks is about all that can be done at
the present time.

RANGER TRIANGLE.

This small plot at Appleton and Suffolk streets affords pleasure to the adjoining residents, and it is regretted that it could

REPORT OF THE PARK COMMISSIONERS.  
not be made larger, but no other land being available for any
further extensions, we can only continue the work in keeping
the same in neat and presentable condition.

ELMWOOD TRIANGLE.

This small plot is at the junction of Laurel and Willow
streets. It was given to the city by one of our citizens, but is
too small at the present time for any development. The Board
hope the coming year to be able to secure some adjoining land,
sufficient to make it large enough, so that it can be developed
and made more attractive. ;

RECOMMENDATIONS.

In concluding our report, we have to say that we believe
it very evident from the foregoing that the city has altogether
too small park area for the wants of her citizens, and that
further additions must be made in the near future, otherwise land will not be available at any price. It is advisable that a
plot be secured for park purposes in Ward One, which Its very
much in need of an open breathing spot for those who are confined indoors during the hot day, and the Board therefore
recommends that you take such action towards securing the

- necessary land for such purposes; also, for the establishing of |
park bordering on the river in Springdale, as well as for the
establishing of park on the Highlands, and also such appropriations as will allow them to prod with the development of
Elmwood and Prospect Parks, for the establishing of park
and playground in Ward One, which shall be in the vicinity of
Lyman and Canal streets.

The Board also have in contemplation the establishing of
one large park covering many acres (which will embrace water
area), laid out in beautiful drives and walks and forestry. |

This Board would therefore recommend that the following
appropriations be made for the coming year: ,

  REPORT OF THE PARK COMMISSIONERS.
For the care and maintenance of the parks the sum of 
For the further development of the various parks, including Elmwood and Prospect Parks,  
For the purchasing of additional lands for future park
purposes, an appropriation, to be made in the
form of Public Park loan,  
The Board would also call your attention to the fact that at
present they have no regular place for holding their meetings or
transacting their business, and they respectfully request that a
room be provided them for that purpose, as they should have a
place for keeping their maps, plans and books, of which they
-will soon have great many, which will be of much value. We
therefore trust that when making the changes in the City Hall
you will give our appeal for suitable room accommodations
careful consideration, all of which is respectfully submitted.

Report of Messrs. Olmstead Bros., Landscape Architects, of Brookline, on
Elmwood Park and Its
Surroundings.

ELMWOOD PARK. ,

The citizens of Holyoke are to be congratulated on their
good fortune in having preserved as public reservation of
natural scenery, and as recreation ground, so strikingly beautiful and picturesque natural feature as the ravine which
occupies substantially the whole of this park.

The most obvious suggestion to be made in connection with
this park is that, considering the character of its scenery it
is not nearly long enough. It ought to extend from Maple
street to Northampton street. We believe it will be wise policy
for the Commissioners to apply substantially the whole of any
available appropriations to the acquirement of additional land
along the ravine until the boundaries of the park have been
extended so as to include the wooded slope of the ravine, with
some additional land, if not too costly, on the plateau adjoining
the ravine, in order to provide room for play-fields. It would
also be very desirable, though perhaps not essential, to include
the hill at the end of Chapin street, now occupied by small
house with its barn and out buildings. This hill commands a
view over the city to Mt. Tom and other interesting distant hills,
and also down the ravine to the country across the Connecticut.
Even if much of this view is eventually blocked by the growth
of trees, the hill would be valuable feature as point of public
resort, and if desired tower of moderate height could be
added.

  REPORT OF THE PARK COMMISSIONERS.

The branch ravine coming from the direction of the High
School has lost much of its beauty, owing to the filling out upon
it of Jackson street and Franklin street. It will be possible to
properly grade these slopes, cover them with topsoil, and plant
them so that eventually the ravine will be beautiful feature;
but inasmuch as it would be comparatively small affair and in
no way better than the main ravine, and as there ought to be
provision in this portion of the park for ball fields and other
recreation grounds, as it is mast convenient to large resident
section of the city, we should recommend that this branch ravine
be completely filled up. For the same reasons any remaining
trees on the flat land adjoining Bh street in the vicinity of
Franklin street, would probably best be removed so that continuous, nearly level surface, unobstructed by trees, will be provided
for a-play-field. The exact outlines of this play-field on the
side toward the main ravine can only be determined by further |
examination on the ground.

It seems pretty obvious that public convenience will eventually require the extension of Pine street to junction with
Ross avenue, probably on curved line and crossing the ravine
by one or more arches. ,

Without the aid of topographical surveys and further examination of the ground it is impracticable at the present time to
define the most suitable boundaries for the park along the south
side of the ravine from Ross avenue to Chapin street. street
has already been graded in this vicinity which might form the
boundary of the park, but it seems probable that by removing
the small hill west of the present termination of Ross avenue
this proposed street could be brought nearer to the ravine, thus
saving expense for land. The hill in question could doubtless
be graded in connection with the extension of Ross avenue to a
junction with Pine street.

It seems probable that small portion of the land near the
ravine on the west side of Chapin street and lying between it
and the east boundary of the property of the Holyoke Hospital
Association south of the ravine ought to be included in the park.
This point, however, cannot be determined without the aid of

REPORT OF THE PARK COMMISSIONERS.  
topographical and property maps and further study on the
ground. .

It is obvious that the east and north boundaries of the extension of the park will be defined by Jackson street, Franklin
street and Bh street, and the west boundary by Northampton
Street.

The south boundary, between Northampton street and the |
Hospital property, will have to be determined mainly by existing property lines and the cost of land in comparison with the
available appropriations. If land at this point proves to be expensive the boundary of the park might be brought within the
width of future street of the top of the bank south of the
ravine.

It would be very desirable to have street substantially parallel with Chapin street extending from Russell terrace to the
Hospital property. There would, of course, be no objection to
making this street wide, with two roadways, and to having the
intervening grass plot gradually increase in width, somewhat as
suggested by the plan prepared by your City Engineer, but it
does not strike us that for park purposes this feature is very
essential one. If the adjoining property owners are willing to
make it an object to the Park Commissioners by giving the
land, it would be worth considering. ‘This extension of Russell
terrace would provide suitable line for driveway, which
seems to be needed to connect with the proposed pleasure drive |
in the ravine, and also with second bridge over the ravine,
affording opportunity for ordinary traffic to cross the park from
Bh street, not far from the end of Linden street. :

With regard to means for making the scenery of the park
conveniently available for public use, it has been assumed (and
we believe very properly so) that there should be drive entering from Maple street and descending as rapidly as may be the
high bank forming the south side of the ravine, and following
the bottom of the ravine to Northampton street. There should
also be walk in the bottom of the ravine.

In order to prevent the destruction of the woods covering the
side of the ravine it will be best to construct the driveway by

  REPORT OF THE PARK COMMISSIONERS.

filling in the bottom of the ravine until sufficient width is

obtained for driveway, say, twenty-four feet wide; for turf

strip of variable width, and walk at least eight feet wide.

There would also have to be sufficient space left for new brook

location about three or four feet lower than the walk and drive| way. :

In the execution of this plan there are considerable difficulties
in connection with the relocation of the brook and the proper
construction of it, so that while providing adequately for floods
it would not be an ugly engineering construction. It would be

 admissible in places, though not desirable for any considerable
distance, to have retaining wall four or five feet high to sustain the bank on the up-hill side of the drive, and if properly
executed with field boulders and dressed with vines, there might
be considerable stretches of wall sustaining the walk and protecting it from the encroachment of the brook. The opposite
side of the brook, however, ought not to be walled, as such a
treatment wovld have most formal and artificial effect. In
most cases we believe it will be practicable to so adjust the
elevation and location of the drive and walks as to make the
new brook follow the natural slope on the side opposite the
walk. In some cases the walk can be diverged from the road so
that the brook can be between the two. In other cases the
irregularities of the ravine can be taken advantage of to form
pools in the brook, which will do much to make the place attractive in summer when the brook becomes insignificant or
dries up altogether. In the latter case the pools can be artificially supplied with water. It will very likely prove necessary
to have the drive across the brook from time to time, in which
case, of course, the brook will have to be carried under it by
means of culvert. In many such cases the upper end of the
culvert can open into walled pit, one side of which would have
a parapet next the walk and drive and the upper side of which
could be utilized as dam for one of the suggested pools.

It appears to have been intended to extend the large brick
culvert under Maple street several hundred feet, at least, up the
ravine, and to fill up the whole ravine substantially to level

REPORT OF THE PARK COMMISSIONERS.  
with Maple street. This plan we regard as entirely contrary to
all the teachings of landscape architecture. The ravine is a
most valuable park feature in its natural condition, and should
be preserved intact as nearly as possible. On no account should
the ravine be filled up. It would not only be expensive, but
would be throwing away very valuable landscape feature, and
one which can very rarely be found in close connection with
cities, and substituting for it perfectly tame and commonplace
lawn and ornamental planting treatment, which can be found in
almost every city, or be created much more easily on almost
any comparatively flat land. Already the large brick culvert
and the tilling have been extended too far from Maple street. A
large amount of additional filling will, however, be required to
terrace out from the south bank for the proposed driveway and
walk, which would have descending grade from Maple street
varying from to per cent. There would be advantages in
the plan of the City Engineer to make this driveway turn quickly
on itself, and crossing the ravine on high grade, descend
gradually on the north bank, but it would be much simpler and
far more convenient for driving to carry the drive continuously
down the south bank. Between the new bank to be formed in
constructing the drive and walk and the north bank, there
would seem to be room for the largest.of the pools. Such a
pool would certainly be very attractive at this point, where the
ravine is deepest.

In re-locating the brook in connection with the construction

of the driveway and walk in the bottom of the ravine, it must
necessarily be placed at an elevation several feet higher than
its present one. Ordinarily it would probably be from five to
ten feet higher than the present bed of the brook. From superficial examination it seems probable that brook thus raised
could not be made to hold water in the absence of an abundant
water supply without artificially puddling the bottom with clay,
owing to the gravelly and sandy character of the earth in the
bottom of the ravine. ‘There will be no difficulty or objection,
however, in making the bottom of the brook water-tight with
clay, protecting it with surfacing of gravel and boulders where

  REPORT OF THE PARK COMMISSIONERS.
the curent requires it, but this treatment of the brook will involve an additional expense, which must not be overlooked.

, Before leaving FKlmwood Park we must criticise the inappropriate way in which the steep banks of the ravine in the park
have been improved. The original undergrowth has been very
generally grubbed out and the surface among the tall forest trees
seeded to grass. In few spots lilacs and other well known
garden-like shrubs have been planted. ‘This treatment is well
enough on level or gently sloping land, where an effect of neatness and artificiality may be necessary to gratify the public

| taste in this direction, as well as to facilitate the proper care
taking of the grounds, it being well known fact that the public
will respect and not destroy grounds which are obviously cared
for in the manner of clipped lawns and with the neatness recognized to be customary in city parks and the better class of
suburban residence grounds.

When it comes to great ravine with steep sides and wooded
banks, such treatment is not only unnecessary, but neither
beautiful nor appropriate, nor well adapted to the conditions.
It is true that the existing undergrowth, where it has not been
disturbed, is composed to an excessive degree of young trees
which, if allowed to grow, would be altogether too thick, and
would produce monotonous mass of pole-like, weak and uninteresting trees, which would be continually dying from the overcrowding and the shade of the taller trees. The remedy, however, is not to make clean sweep of everything but the largest
trees, and seed the surface with grass, but to gradually thin out
these young trees and replace them with shrubs and shade-loving woodland plants, such as already exist more or less. In
doing this, however, good deal of intelligent study and consideration should be given the matter. It would be monotonous
and thoughtless to plant everywhere the same selection of plants,
even though they might be well adapted to the shade, or in
themselves or in masses good in appearance. The circumstances
should be carefully regarded. Where there is the most moisture,
plants and shrubs requiring moisture should be used. On the
upper parts of the bank and on projecting promontories, on the

| REPORT OF THE PARK COMMISSIONERS.  
other hand, plants which can better endure the summer drought
should be used. Certain areas should be planted only with
very low growths, so as not to obstruct views up and down the
banks. Other places should be filled with taller growing shrubs
and small-growing trees, which will be long-lived in the shade of
the taller trees, such, for instance, as the hornbeam, the flowering dogwood, the shadbush, and the like. Much attention
should be paid to the introduction of ferns, violets, and other
woodland plants. The extent of ground to be covered with
such plants is so great, however, that only comparatively
small area can be planted in any one year. Still, by adopting a
carefully thought-out scheme, the intended effect can be obtained
in time, but there will never be time when alterations and additions to the trees and undergrowth will not be desirable. The

best policy would be to establish permanent park nursery,
which would afford more or less employment for the planting
men at the seasons when planting is not going on in the park
proper. Such nursery is particularly valuable, because it will
afford the opportunity of providing class of plants not readily
obtainable at sufficiently low cost, such as mountain laurel, the
native rhododendrons, the American holly, the Canadian yew
or ground hemlock, the evergreen ferns, the evergreen inkberry,
the beautiful glossy-leaved cat-briar, the low evergreen, creeping plants, such as partridge-berry, bear-berry, and the like.

While the woods should be relieved of any excessive amount

of dead wood, either in trees or on the ground, yet wherever
possible the leaves should be allowed to remain upon the ground.
On the steep slopes and secluded spots thickets of bushes can
be maintained without interfering with the fullest reasonable use |
of the ground by the public. Some parts of the woods are composed largely of pines. These afford very desirable contrast
with the other portions where the woods are mainly deciduous.
There are very few hemlocks in the woods, however, and some
sections should be planted with hemlocks for the sake of the increased depth of shade and the desirable effect of seclusion
which they afford. They would be most desirable on the banks
along the deepest part of the ravine.

  REPORT OF THE PARK COMMISSIONERS. .

In connection with the proposed play-field. at the corner of
Franklin street and Bh street there should be, probably on
the side toward the ravine, public shelter building containing
the necessary toilet conveniences. This building could probably ,
be arranged in two stories, the upper one being entirely open on
the sides, with, perhaps, refreshment stand, and the lower one
being utilized for the public toilet rooms and secluded gallery
overlooking the ravine scenery, and rooms for administration
purposes, including storeroom for materials, tool room, and a
room for the workmen to resort to during stormy weather and in
which to eat their noon-day meal during cold weather. It is possible that this building could be placed, at the point where the
ravine changes its direction as to command views both up and
down the ravine. It would probably be desirable to associate
with this building some sand courts for httle children and with
the playground small amount of outdoor gymnastic apparatus
of the simplest kind.

SEWERS AND DRAINS.

A beginning has been made on the long contemplated Highland sewerage system by the laying of storm water sewer in
Madison avenue and Jefferson street, from Northampton street
to the Dingle.

) This sewer is an Akron pipe inches in diameter having a

discharging capacity sufficient to convey the run-off of the water
shed contributing to it, thus preventing any more washouts
which have been the cause of so much litigation during the past .
two years. Likewise the obstruction to travel of all kinds
caused by surface water collecting on Northampton street at
the intersection of the latter with Madison avenue will no longer
be experienced.
 The construction of that part of the Highlands system as
| planned should be completed as soon as possible, the more
especially since much of the sickness in that district will always
be attributed by those affected to the want of such system.

In the event of the City being financially unable to construct
this system the coming year or the following year or for some
years yet, it might be possible to make some arrangement with
the Holyoke Water Power Company and the local and state
boards of health by which the sewage could be discharged into
the river above the dam for limited number of years, when,
after the expiration of such period, it could be conveyed and
discharged into the Front street sewer in the manner described
in the annual report of this department.

Such an arrangement would seem to be proper one, especially
when we consider the very scattered and sparse population of
the territory to be sewered and that its growth is not anything
like what was anticipated few years ago.

The remaining sewers constructed during the year consist of
an in. Akron pipe laid in Arlington street between Lincoln and |
Allyn streets, discharging into the Allyn street sewer ;'an extension of the Allyn street sewer by an Akron pipe ro inches in
diameter laid from Waldo street to Arlington street; inch
Akron pipe laid in Northampton street from the Dwight street
sewer feet northerly; an extension of the Samosett street
sewer by inch Akron pipe laid to West street. The wooden
sluice-way which conveyed the surface water in Chapin street to
the “Dingle” was replaced this year by inch Akron pipe;
which runs from the lowest point in Chapin street opposite
Gates street, in westerly direction, through the Murray estate
for distance of feet to the “Dingle.”

Permanent work of considerable extent has been done in the
Street Department the past year. The granite block pavement
on Main street, from Mosher street to Dwight street and on
Dwight street from Main street to the second level canal, was
taken up and replaced by vitrified brick laid on base of concrete.

The blocks removed were relaid on Appleton street on a
gravel base between High street and the Holyoke and Westfield
Railroad, and on the south side of Appleton street for width
of twenty feet from Bowers street to Winter street, and on
Bowers street for short distance southerly from Mosher street.

  REPORT OF THE CITY ENGINEER.
Vitrified brick on concrete base was also laid on Cabot
street from the easterly side of Main street across Main street
‘to the westerly side of Main street and from the first level canal
to the second level canal on the southerly side of the street, between the street car tracks and the curbing. The total number
of square yards of vitrified brick laid during the year was  ;
the total cost of which was or  per square yard.

Local brick has been laid on Lincoln street from Northampton street, easterly for distance of feet.

Tar macadam has been laid on Maple street from Dwight
to Hampden street. This kind of material, as now prepared for
roadways, is of recent date and claimed to be the result of careful investigation and experiments made by Warren Brothers, of
Boston, Mass., who have laid the macadam by contract at ,
per square yard. :

Tar macadam makes very satisfactory road surface for
light travel, it differing from the common macadam in its being
free from dust and not so prone to ravel in dry weather. Nothing can be said as yet, about its wear or durability, since experience with it for some years can only show this. ,

Common macadam has been laid on Canal street from Main
‘street to Park street; on Park street from Canal street to
Crescent street; on Crescent street from Park street to Appleton street; on Summer street from Cabot street to Sargeant
street; and on North Bridge street from East Dwight street to
Canal street. .

The macadam, after being rolled in, measured on an average
of seven inches in thickness at the crown, and of three inches
in thickness at the gutters.

The work was done by the city at thirty-six cents per square
yard. This very low price should warrant the laying of macadam
in future on those streets free from the heavier travel and where

 gravel has always been the road metal used.

The new gutters of vitrified brick, feet in width, first suggested and afterwards laid by the Superintendent of Out-Door
Work in our streets having granite block pavement are giving ,
entire satisfaction and are highly commendable as they not only

REPORT OF THE CITY ENGINEER.  
offer less resistance to surface drainage but make excellent
tracks for bicycle travel. :

Eight feet has been added on the south side of Ely street, ,
between West street and Ely lane, thus making the width of that
street feet.

Cherry street has been relocated between Northampton 
street and Hillside avenue and the old county road through the
Whiting farm has been discontinued.

a RECOMMENDATIONS.

Dwight street, one of the oldest and much used thoroughfares of the City deserves prior attention in the line of permanent improvement to be made on our streets the coming year.
This street is the poorest of our urban streets, it being always
muddy and heavy in wet weather and exdingly dusty in dry
weather. It is therefore recommended that this street from Elm
street to School street be paved with brick or some other
material that makes permanent road surface.

The brick pavement on Appleton street west of High street
should be extended from Bh street to Linden street and
granite block pavement should be laid between Bowers and
Winter streets.

The asphalt block pavement between and adjoining the
street railroad tracks on High street from Appleton street to
Cabot street is in deplorable condition and should be repaired
in the early spring. Before this is done the common form of
“Tee” rails laid there at present should be replaced by grooved
rails.

, BRIDGES.

The past year has been busy one in the construction of
bridges. The old valley bridge so called which for years has
caused so much anxiety regarding its safety has been replaced
by new one composed of wood and iron. While this department makes no claim to having superior knowledge of or originality in bridge construction, yet it takes pride in having designed type of bridge amply sufficient in strength for all kinds of
traffic at very moderate cost.

The new features which this bridge has and which have
been introduced for the first time in bridge construction in this
city, are its permanent roadway and sidewalks supported by a
wood and iron framework. All the woodwork is so designed
and fashioned to the ironwork, that each member of the former
can be removed at any time and replaced by new member
without disturbing the permanent roadway above or interfering
with travel.

The permanent roadway consists of pavement of vitrified
brick supported by concrete and multiplex plate which in turn
are supported by inch “I”? beams set feet apart and at right
angles to the main trusses of the bridge.

The structure is double tracked for electric car service and
designed to carry live load of pounds per square foot. Its
total cost was sum rather moderate when compared
with the cost of some of the other city bridges which have cost
from  to Rivers Young of Willimansett,
Mass., were the contractors for the construction of the bridge
and have done the work to the entire satisfaction of the city.

  REPORT OF THE CITY ENGINEER. |

Another new bridge in course of construction at present is
one across the second level canal on Jackson street. This street,
while being used by the public for many years, has been private
thoroughfare until the past year, when it was accepted by the
city.

When the street was accepted the old bridge there was in a
dangerous condition and not open to traffic, consequently in the
acceptance of the street by the city, new bridge was necessary
before the street could be opened. The new structure will be a
wooden one and will cost  which is the contract price
as rendered by Rivers and Young,contractors for its construction.

The iron foot bridge across the Boston and Maine Railroad
tracks on Dwight street has been carefully cleaned and painted,
and the Cabot street bridge over the first level canal and two
spans of the county bridge leading to South Hadley have been
re-planked.

RECOMMENDATIONS. .

If the City can afford it new bridge should be built on
Main street over the third level canal. The structure there at
present has been condemned as unsafe several years ago and although repairs have been made on it from time to time since
then, yet it is anything but prudent to wait until the structure
collapses before replacing it by new one.

The conditions of, and the repairs needed on, some of the
other bridges of the city have been stated in report made on
September sth to the Board of Public Works. Since this report
is on record in the archives of the office of the Board, repitition is unnecessary.

PUBLIC BATH HOUSE.
Early in the year this department was “ordered” by the
Le \
Board of Aldermen to prepare plans and specifications for a
public bath house to be erected in Ward Two, at cost not to
exd Owing to this limited appropriation it was
thought advisable to construct bath house similar to that constructed in Ward Six in  description of which is given in
the City Engineer's report of that year. This is what has been
done, with the exception of few minor improvements, such as
an extra shower bath for adults and the entire roofing in of the
- swimming basin, so as to shut it out from the view of the tenement blocks which surround it.
The manner in which this bath house was patronized during
the summer, and also the patronage received by the bath house
in Ward Six during the past three years, demonstrates beyond

  REPORT OF THE CITY ENGINEER.

question the demand for such facilities, especially in the more

thickly settled centers. Consequently, with the addition of similar bath houses in Wards Four and One, the present needs of

the city in this direction would be fairly well provided for.
HOUSE NUMBERING.

- This department has assigned numbers for Springfield street
from Prew avenue to the West Springfield line, also for many
new buildings throughout the city.

WATER WORKS.

The new cast iron water main inches in diameter, part of
which was laid in  has been completed the past year. This
main runs from Dwight street to the ‘Rock Cut,” so called,
where it is connected with and fed by the  -inch main leading
from the gate house at Wright’s pond. Notwithstanding grave
doubts were expressed by the uninitiated as to what the outcome would be by such an arrangement, viz: having one  -inch
main feet in length feeding one  -inch main, and two  inch mains several thousand feet in length, the results have
shown that such an arrangement has been very proper one
since the desired effect upon the pressure has been obtained

it having been increased on an average of pounds, or just
exactly the amount computed by the engineers, when this method
of increasing the alarmingly low pressure in the business centers
was first proposed by them.

A new set of maps showing the locations and size of all pipe,
gates, hydrants, services, blow-offs, etc., of the distribution
system, also the private mains leading to the mills, have been
completed. ‘These maps, which number  are inches
in size and are made to scale of feet to an inch. In future’
this department should be notified of all extensions or alterations made in the distribution system so that these maps may be
corrected and kept up to date.

A large map has been made of the distribution system for

REPORT OF THE CITY ENGINEER. |
the convenience of the Superintendent of the Water Works upon
a scale of feet to an inch. This map shows at glance the
relative sizes of the entire pipe system and where extensions and
alterations of the mains can be made to the best advantage.
Much work was done in this department in the preparation of
the defence of the city in the cases against it arising from the
taking of the water of the Manhan River. The flow of water at
the point of diversion as measured, and the value of the same to
the different petitigners for damages at their respective mill
privileges, were carefully computed, and upon these computations strong defence for the city was built and maintained.
No little credit should be given to the past management of the
Water Department for its foresight in causing to be made and
recorded the daily flow of the Manhan River, as it was unquestionably due to this that such favorable settlements on the
side of the City were made possible.

REPORT OF THE
 BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.
CiTY OF HOLYOKE, MASSACHUSETTS. \
Office of the Board of Public Works, Dec.  rgor. |
fon. Arthur B. Chapin, Mavor, and the Honorable, the Members
of the Board of Aldermen of the City of Holyoke.

GENTLEMEN:—The fifth annual report of the Board of Public
Works is herewith presented for your consideration, and for a
detailed report of the work done by this department we call
your attention to the exhibits hereunto annexed.

There can be but one successful and satisfactory way of caring
for the surfaces of our streets and the maintenance of our sewers,
sidewalks and public buildings and that is by sufficient expenditure for permanent work each year. ‘The policy adopted this
year seems to be wise one in so far as the improvement of
roadways is concerned, but the same proposition constantly
confronts the municipality—the need of lasting improvements

| in the departments under the Board, and providing the means

whereby such improvements can be made. It appears to the

Board more strongly this year perhaps, than before, that much

' permanent work should be done upon the streets the coming
year.

It is clear to the Board that macadam roadways such as were
placed on Canal, Park, Bridge and part of Summer streets this
year should be extended to majority of the streets east of Race
street, and to many streets on the “Hill” section, so called, and
in Ward Four. ‘The advantages of macadam over gravel needs

  REPORT OF THE BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.
no explanation. That it is more economical than gravel to the
City of Holyoke has been demonstrated in this city many times |
and at no time more forcibly than during the past fall, when a
: macadam roadway was put down on Park street at cost of only
-  cents per square yard, cost which seems almost incredible to road builders. ‘The style of laying macadam roadways as
adopted by the Board has proven economical, and we believe that
the work as done will prove lasting improvement. The surface of the streets upon which the macadam was laid was below
the established grade, and therefore excavating was found to be
unnecessary, except in some few instances where portions of the
streets had not worn away. In building the macadam roadways
this year the Board has used only the medium and finer grades
of crushed stone, the coarsest grade of stone being eliminated
from the streets entirely. Much sand was used in place of the
finest grade of macadam, and this seemed to answer all practical
purposes as well as the finest grade of stone. We believe that
the practicability of the use of sand in place of the fine stone has
been demonstrated, and that it has answered all of the purposes
for which the finest stone is designed. We believe that this
class of work should be extended as fast as possible, and so long
as the crushed stone can be obtained on board cars in this city
at the prices for which it was obtained the past year we deem it
inadvisable to establish municipal crusher. .

An experimental stretch of bituminous macadam was laid
this season on Maple street between Dwight and Hampden
streets and it has proven very satisfactory thus far. Should the
street stand the traffic well through the winter we shall be favorable to the further use of this material in the city.

A start has been made this year in replacing the granite
paving blocks on Main street with vitrified brick, the work |
being done from Mosher street to Dwight street on Main and

‘from Main street to the second level canal bridge on Dwight
street. ‘he improvement in the streets is marked. The granite |
blocks taken from the streets were used on Appleton street
between High street and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad tracks and between Bowers street and Winter

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.  
street. In the latter location only the south side of the street
being paved except portion of the street at Winter street where
the entire width of Appleton street was paved. small portion
of Bowers street south of Mosher street was also paved with
these blocks. It is the opinion of the Board that the work of
replacing the granite on Main street with brick should be continued the coming year, the work being commenctd at Dwight
street and carried south on the westerly side of the street. With
this end in view the Holyoke Street Railway Company was asked
this fall to relay with grooved rails its track on the western side
of the street during the early part of the coming year and as
soon as this is done it is the intention of the Board to push the
work forward. ‘The blocks taken from this street will be used
in other sections of the city where the grades are excessive.
The vitrified brick paving on Main street has given general
satisfaction to the abuttors and to the people who have been 
obliged to use the street. ‘The cost of this work was  per
square yard.

The work done last year on High street between the street
railway tracks has met with general approval. The condition
of the asphalt blocks on this street demands attention the coming year. ‘The blocks should be relaid between Appleton and
Cabot streets early in the year. The Street Railway Company
has already been requested to provide grooved rails in this section, and when this improvement is made High street will be in )
a condition where nothing need be done on it for some years.

a Brick paving should be extended on Lyman street to Bridge
street, and Race street from Dwight street southerly should
receive attention, and either paving blocks or macadam should
be laid there at once.

The south side of Cabot street between the first and second
level canals has been paved with vitrified blocks, the first to be
used in this city, and at the same time the intersection of Main
and Cabot streets was paved with these blocks. ‘lhe blocks as
placed in this location cost  per square yard, and the
blocks laid on the south side of Cabot street cost  per
square yard, the difference in cost being occasioned by the

  REPORT OF THE BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.

many street car tracks at the intersection of Main and Cabot
streets. The Board believes that attention should be given to
the north side of this street during the coming summer. |

More attention should be given to the country roads than in
the past, and while in the main they are in good condition,
there are many stretches that need attention, and especially
widening out'‘to their full width. The roadway on the Easthampton hill just west from Northampton street was widened
at cost of giving much-needed improvement to this
road.

The present canal bridges should be replaced as fast as they
show any signs of weakness, and already there are number that
need attention. start was made this year when new bridge
was constructed across the second level canal on Bridge street
at cost of of which the Holyoke Street Railway
Company paid The bridge has trussed wood girders,
supporting permanent roadway of steel beams, concrete
arches and vitrified brick. ‘These trusses or girders can be replaced at any time that they show signs of weakness without in
any way interfering with the main construction of the bridge.
The roadway of the structure is of vitrified brick and the sidewalks are of concrete. ‘This bridge supplants the Valley bridge,

: so called, landmark of the city, which was built in  .

The iron bridge over the third level canal on Main street at
the United States Envelope Company’s plant should be replaced
soon with modern structure. When this work is done one-half
of the expense will be shared by the Holyoke Street Railway
Company.

A detailed report of the condition of the city’s bridges has
been made by the City Engineer, and is on file in this office.

Eight hundred and sixty-six dollars and sixty-seven cents was
expended in setting out and caring for trees during the season.
The Board believes that more attention should be given this department, and plans for the placing of many additional trees the
coming year.

The first steps towards the construction of the Highland
sewer were taken during the summer when storm water sewer

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS. 
was laid from Northampton street through Madison avenue to
Jefferson street and into the dingle above Pleasant street. The
sewer is twenty-four inches in diameter and is of sufficient size to
care for all of the water that emanates from this section. Additional. work should be done on this system the coming year, and '
steps should be taken to relieve the sewer running down Hampden street, which frequently is overtaxed.

There is large section on the Highlands yet unprovided
with sewage and sewers should be extended to this section the
coming season, also sewers should be provided for the Hitchcock tract, so called, in Elmwood, and the Corser tract in Ingleside. start should also be made upon surface water sewer
for Ward Four. The Board recommends appropriations in the
sewer department sufficient to meet these demands.

The demands upon the Board for sidewalks and curbing

. could not be met this year with the means at hand, although the
appropriation was larger than in preceding years. Much of the
appropriation was used in placing walks around the new school
buildings finished this season and also around the public library
building, just completed. ‘The benefits to the city of good sidewalks, well curbed and paved gutters need not be enumerated

| here. We recommend an appropriation in the department of at
least  for sidewalk purposes.

The Elmwood, Springdale and Highlands school buildings
started last year were completed this season and are now occupied. They furnish needed and increased accommodations
for the school department in these sections and are of modern
design and construction throughout.

‘here is constantly increasing demand upon this department for the caring of school buildings and public buildings in
general, and we deem it wiser policy to keep the buildings in a
good state of repair by adding the needed work yearly than to
allow them to deteriorate, when special appropriations will be
necessary to place them in condition. We believe that the
buildings generally are in good condition, but attention should
be given to the sanitary needs of the East Dwight street building and the South Chestnut Street School the coming year.

  REPORT OF THE BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS. |

Work is in progress at the present time on public sanitary
in the basement of the City Hall building and we expect that
this will be completed early in the coming year. An institution
of this kind has long been needed in the city.

| new bath-house was provided for the residents of Ward
‘Two this year at cost of about including the operation
of the same from its completion till the time for closing the
house. We are thoroughly impressed with the advantages
offered by these public institutions, and believe that they should
be extended to other parts of the city. We believe that they
keep the boys from bathing in the canals, and if one was located
at some central part of Ward Four we believe that the frequent
drowning accidents in the river would thereby be avoided. We
are of the opinion that steps should be taken the coming season
to provide bath-house for this section. The cost of operating
these houses after they have been erected amounts to only about
$  yearly, and their benefits are worth many times this
amount.

One of the most difficult problems which the Board has been |
compelled to contend with is the removal of ashes and garbage,
and until there is just and equitable ordinance covering the
point passed and an enforcement of the same by the departments of the city, there can be no satisfactory method employed
in the collection of these refuse matters. It is the intention of
the Board to give the matter much thought, and the Honorable
Board of Aldermen will in all probability be requested early in
the year to pass an ordinance meeting the approval of this
Board. ‘The constant additions to the territory covered by the
Departments add to the cost of collection yearly, and report
from the foreman in this department states that there have been

. more than tenements added to the list this year.

‘The manner of collecting the garbage has been unsatisfactory
to the Board the past year. The settlement of this question is
a matter of future consideration, as the present contract does
not expire until May but it is not reasonable to presume that the work can be done in proper manner for the

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.  
amount of money that the city has been paying for the same in
past years.

The Board recommends the purchasing of an additional
steam road roller. |

REPORT OF THE
OVERSEERS OF THE POOR. .
To the Honorable, the Mayor, and Board of Aldermen of the City
of Holyoke.

The Overseers of the Poor respectfully submit their twentyseventh annual report, covering the year ending November  ,
Igol.

The report for the year is about the same as in previous
years; the same conditions existed among many of the poor,
and the same problems had to be met in the distribution of
relief to the poor of the City. In all cases we have endeavored
to be just, as well as economical, consistent with the best
interests of the recipients as well as the welfare of the City.

There has been great demand on this department during
the year for the relief of families who were compelled to apply
for aid because of the desertion of the husbands and fathers
and leaving the families destitute. We have had twenty-four
of such cases—a record that we hope will not be equalled in
many years to come.

OUT-DOOR RELIEF.

The number of families aided during the year was  ,
representing persons, at an expense of This
department also furnished burial for eighty-two bodies at an
expense of .

The total expense for the year for all classes of partial and
full support has been as follows:

REPORT OF OVERSEERS OF THE POOR.  
CITY FARM. |

In our last report we called attention to the great need of a
chapel in connection with the institution. The need this year
is still greater than ever, as there are now about ninety inmates
who desire to attend religious services on Sunday, and the
present accommodations will seat but fifty; so it can be very
readily seen the necessity of hall or chapel. We trust this will
be attended to the present year.

We also again call attention to the need of an auxiliary
lighting plant, in order to have lights during the night, particularly for the hospital wards. As the number of patients in that
department has increased so as to demand the attention of night
nurses, the necessity of lights during the night can very readily
be seen. This addition to the lighting plant can be put in with
but very little expense. We trust that this will be attended to
as soon as possible.

The number of inmates cared for during the year was as
follows :

Number December goo,  
Number admitted during the year,  
Total number,  
Number discharged and died,  
Number remaining November go  
HOSPITAL DEPARTMENT.

In this part of the institution, patients were cared for,
  of whom were admitted direct and the remainder were inmates of the institution. Thirty deaths occurred during the
year.

Following is detailed statement of expenses at the City

. Farm.

There is very little difference in the work of this department
from year to year. During the past year we have had fewer
young girls brought before the court, and only two sent to Lancaster School for Girls. Five have been placed on probation
and the most cases have profited by it.

There are many calls at this time of the year for warm clothing, shoes, etc., especially for women and children. And would
ask the charitably disposed to assist in this work, by donations
of cast-off clothing.

REPORT OF POLICE DEPARTMENT. |
I thank those who have sent me parcels during the year. I
also thank the ladies of the ‘““Needlework Guild” for their generous donation of nice new garments, shoes and hosiery.
I meet with the same courteous treatment and ready co-operation from the Marshal and superior officers, and have every
‘ reason to think that the Police Matron” is appreciated by the
entire force, as all are kind and obliging, always ready to assist me in my work. ,
I take this opportunity of returning them my sincere thanks.

LAW AND ORDER. oO

As law-abiding city, ours will compare favorably with any
gin the country. During the year few serious crimes have been

committed, and in most cases arrests have speedily followed.

When one stops to consider our cosmopolitan population
and looks over the classification of arrests by offences charged,
he will see the force of the above statement.

During the past year the department have been called upon
on several occasions to look out for large crowds in our city.
The first was the paper makers, but they conducted themselves
in such an orderly manner that not single arrest could be
traced to their ranks, which reflects great credit to them and to
our city as well. Labor Day, when there were as many or more
people on our streets than at any one time in its history, and
only one single arrest was made in twenty-four hours. ‘There
were several others, all of which were conducted in quiet and
orderly manner, and proves we are law-abiding city, and the
citizens take civic pride in our good name. ;

' RECOMMENDATIONS.
I hope the incoming City Government will see its way clear
to increase the department in the Patrol Service to four more
men, in order to give the department the three relief system, as
the morning watch from four A. M. is not in condition to give
proper protection to the City; as we only have from four A. M.,
four men doing duty until the day watch report at eight A. M.
This accomplished, it will place the department in first class
condition.

I have contemplated for some time arranging system
whereby the night men when not on street duty could be kept at
the station during certain hours, and so assembled could be disREPORT OF POLICE DEPARTMENT.  
patched upon short notice to any part of the city, leaving the
regular patrolinen on their routes.

This system is in operation in some cities and will when
established in this city greatly increase the efficiency of the
night force. do not think however that this can be done successfully until the Police have new building which hope to
see in the near future.

CONCLUSION. |

I desire to express my appreciation of the ever courteous |
treatment accorded me by his Honor, the Mayor, and the Judges
and Clerk of the Police Court for the ready assistance rendered
me at all times in the performance of my duties.

Respectfully submitted,
J. SIDNEY WRIGHT,
Marshal of Police

,  Lyman Mills Case.

During the year, after considerable delay the Commissioner
in this case filed his report in the Superior Court of Hampden

tried during the coming year.

little reason why the coming year should not see an end of this
important piece of litigation.

of the Law Department. There have been numerous hearings
from time to time before the Commissioners and before the
Court in regard to this matter, and at all of these hearings the

REPORT OF CITY SOLICITOR.  
city has been represented. This matter is extremely important,
because of the fact that the law which authorizes the building
of the bridge makes possible some assessment of the cost of the
same on the towns and cities immediately adjacent to Springfield and also on the county at large. The work of the department has been greatly aided by the courtesy of all the other ,
departments of the city and in particular by the Police Department,the City Physician and the City Engineer and his assistants.

REPORT OF CITY PHYSICIAN.

To His Honor, the Mayor, and the Gentlemen of the Board of
Aldermen of the City of Holyoke }

The following report is respectfully submitted by the City
Physician for the year ending November go viz.:

During the past year, as City Physician, have rendered
medical service in response to calls. ,

Cases of measles, scarlet fever and diphtheria, which usually
result in epidemics, were very few, compared with the year
 About  cases of typhoid fever were treated, and successful results ensued in all cases. Only one case of smallpox
occurred that came under my official charge. The patient in
that case was confined to the pest-house, and the result was an

uneventful recovery.

Examinations were made of applicants for appointments
to the Police Department.

Vaccinations of students of the Public Schools and employees
of factories, for the most part, and the signing of certificates
thereof, numbered  an increase of over last year,
which increase was due primarily to the threatened invasion of
smallpox.

At the request of the City Solicitor, examined several
patients who sustained injuries by reason of accidents, in which
the City might be hable, with view to giving testimony pertaining thereto. Notwithstanding the criminal case of Alberto
was not exactly within my province, at the request of the Police
Department aided professionally in procuring medical expert
testimony, and rendered the same at the trial of the case.

In addition to the services enumerated have answered all
calls of the hospitals, police station and casualties.

REPORT OF CITY PHYSICIAN.  
Provision has been made for office accommodations for the
City Physician at the City Hall, and it is expected that the
office will soon be ready for occupancy. The necessity and
' convenience of the arrangement find justification in the centrality of its location and its proximity to the Police Department.
Twelve cases of confinement were treated by me, six of
which occurred at the City Farm Hospital. The hospital
arrangements at the City Farm have been very satisfactory.
The changes that have been wrought have resulted in ample
accommodations for City patients who have occasion to be sent
there, and the facilities for their treatment have been so improved, and the officials and attendants have become so familiar
with, and dexterous in, the performance of their duties, that the
patients have no cause for complaint, and no reluctance about
going there. |
, take occasion at this time to again recommend an improvement of the electric light plant at the City Farm, so as to con- .
duce to the facility of treating patients during the night. ‘The
increase of patients and the frequency of night calls, in cases of
serious nature, render it hazardous to delay such improvement.
There is nurse in nightly attendance, and under the existing
conditions she can work with very little satisfaction in the face |
of these annoying difficulties. The City Physician is greatly
troubled in the performance of his duties by the dimness of light
and finds these conditions disagreable. desire to be emphatic
on this point and hope the suggestion will be heeded.

  INSPECTOR OF MILK, VINEGAR AND PETROLEUM.
The prosecutions were two cases where the parties were sell. ing milk of not good standard quality; both were convicted and
fined  each.

The quality of the samples of milk that have tested have

, been in almost every case of good standard quality so that  
have sent but six warnings.

Health Officer Linehan and myself have stopped the sale of
milk in one store that was not fit place, and ordered several
others to take better care of it, also warned several peddlers
against carrying swill in same carriage with milk; these warnings have generally been heeded.

The Board of Aldermen have passed an ordinance placing
the Inspector of Milk under the jurisdiction of the Board of
Health, and also provides for collector of samples, allows continuous work, therefore better results. .

With my report of last year was found the laws of Massachusetts relating to milk, butter, cheese, vinegar, and the city
ordinance regarding petroleum. ‘These have been given to those
taking out licenses.

My work has been greatly aided by the help of his Honor,
the Mayor, City Marshal, Patrolmen, Board of Health, and my
collector, James Thompson.

VINEGAR.

, have tested samples of vinegar this year at different
times and have failed to find suspicious sample. am satisfied that all the vinegar now sold here is up to the standard. OLEOMARGARINE.

[ have worked with the State Inspector this year, which resulted in the conviction of two parties in this city who were
fined each; also one in Chicopee, one in Northampton,
and two in Springfield, who were fined each, and nine
restaurant keepers in Springfield that were fined each.

If there is any oleomargarine sold here new it must be sent
in from out of the city, as no one here has license to sell it.

INSPECTOR OF MILK, VINEGAR AND PETROLEUM.  PETROLEUM.
I have tested this year tank cars, bbls. of wholesaler,
and samples taken from stores.
In May an oil company sent some oil here in barrels, and I
found it of very low test, and the third lot they sent con: demned and ordered them not to sell for illuminating purposes.
Since then they have sent no more oil here. This is the only
case that have found where the oil was not up to the standard.
