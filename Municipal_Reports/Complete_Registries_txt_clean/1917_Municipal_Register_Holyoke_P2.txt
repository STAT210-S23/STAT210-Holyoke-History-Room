and the use of soap and water and thorough scrubbing

Three general inspections have been made of saloons
and the majority have been found to comply to the rules of
the Board of Health. Frequent inspections of few places
have been necessary to keep them up to the standard, and
a general improvement as regards clean and sanitary conditions can be reported.

In conclusion desire to thank the members of the department for their courtesy and co-operation.

Respectfully submitted,

  REPORT OF THE CITY SOLICITOR

In the case of Thomas McMahon v. City of Holyoke,
which was bill in equity brought by the plaintiff in  
to enjoin the defendant from maintaining culvert -under
the highway adjacent to the plaintiff’s land, there was a
finding in favor of the defendant in the Superior court.
The plaintiff excepted to the court’s finding, and the case
was submitted to the Supreme court on briefs. During the
present year the decree of the Superior court was affirmed
by the Supreme court and the plaintiff’s bill dismissed. The
question of maintaining the culvert, which has been constant source of trouble for number of years, was later
finally settled by the City’s purchasing permanent right
of way over and through the land of Thomas McMahon for
the purpose of maintaining ditch connected with the
culvert, which will take care of all surface water which
formerly flowed over the road. Thomas McMahon was paid
$  for said right of way.

The City of Holyoke by right of eminent domain took
  square feet of land from Eugenie O. LaFrance at
the corner of Lincoln and Northampton streets for the purpose of widening the curve at the northwest corner of these
two streets, and  was awarded as damages, which
was accepted by the owner. Certain land adjoining this
curve on the north side of Northampton street was also
taken by the City from Henry G. Sears, Philander Moore
and the Sarah A. Lewis heirs or devisees for the purpose of
widening Northampton street between Lincoln and Morgan
streets. The question of assessment of damages for this
land taken is still pending. At the Northeast corner and
northwest corner of Dwight and Northampton streets the
city took square feet of land under the same authority from Edward N. White for the purpose of widening the curves at both these corners. For this land damages
for  were awarded and accepted by Mr. White.

A new street running between High and Railroad
streets south of the City Hall and known as City Hall Court,


REPORT OF THE CITY SOLICITOR  
was laid out by the City, and square feet of land owned
by the Holyoke Water Power Company was taken by right
of eminent domain. The City’s offer for this }and was refused by the owner, who brought suit in orde’: to have the
question of the amount of damages settled by jury. The
case is now pending.

There are number of cases now pending in court
against the City. Some of these will be settled; others will
have to be tried.

In September of this year Frank J. O’Neil, the City Solicitor, was drafted for service under the Selective Service
Law, and on the twenty-first day of September was appointed acting City Solicitor by His Honor, Mayor John J.
White.

During the year this office has submitted number of
opinions to the different departments and officials of the
city. The city solicitor has also represented the city at a
number of legislative hearings in Boston in which the city
was interested. This office has also collected numerous
claims for different departments of the city.

In conclusion, this office wishes to express its thanks
and appreciation to His Honor the Mayor and other city
(Officials for the assistance rendered the department in the
performance of its duties.

WILLIAM T. DILLON,
Acting City Solicitor.

PART II

REPORT OF THE SCHOOL BOARD
To His Honor, the Mayor, and the Citizens of Holyoke:

The School Board respectfully submits this annual report for the year  The report, which covers year
of successful effort and accomplishment in public school
work, is brief, general statement dealing only with essential topics.

. FINANCES

It is difficult to discuss the question of money in relation to education, for education is one of the things that
cannot really be bought or sold. It is the policy of this
Board to request and to spend reasonable appropriation
for our public schools and to see that all expenditures are
made on business basis, wisely and efficiently. It is generally agreed that twenty-five per cent yearly is reason able percentage of revenue payments of cities to be expended for support of publie schools. Sinee this
Board has expended, on the average, slightly less than
twenty per cent of the revenue payments of the city. During  in view of war conditions, this Board will endeavor to conduet school finances in an especially economieal way, but without impairing the efficiency of the schools.
Some increases in salary must be granted, and some allowance must be made for the greatly increased cost of supplies.

CONDITION OF SCHOOL BUILDINGS

On the whole the condition of school buildings is good.
Although the buildings are in use on the average only

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
sixty per cent of ten-hour day, they are subjected to
wear and tear out of the ordinary. The buildings need constant repairs and attention. It is gratifying to report that
most of the repairs and improvements requested in the .
  report have been made. This Board hopes to be able
to take up with the Finance Committee of the Board of
Aldermen and with the Board of Public Works, in conference, the whole question of repairs in school buildings.
However, special attention is called at this time to the
larger improvements needed, such as painting the interior
of the West Street School, painting most of the classrooms
in the Highland School, installing new sanitaries and improving the heating system in the Elmwood School, improvements in lighting the Lawrence School, installing
shower baths at the Morgan School and at the West Street
School, and general repairs and painting at the High School
Gymnasium building. It is especially recommended that
a small separate heater be installed to heat the water used
in the pool. The present plan of heating it from the large
boilers which form part of the heating plant of the whole
building is very wasteful, and, in the warm months, very
uncomfortable.

| PROPOSED NEW LAWRENCE SCHOOL

For some years the School Board has urged the build.
ing of new Lawrence School on the so-called Maple Street
playground lot. The central school district has been crowded at least eight years. The present Lawrence School as
a building is old, noisy, poorly lighted and unsatisfactory.
However, in view of the high cost of labor and building materials, and in view of the increasing difficulty in obtaining the latter, this Board wishes to defer all action relative to the new Lawrence School. It is clearly not the time
to urge this matter. But, this Board does wish to recommend that, by painting and by the installing of electric

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
lights, the present Lawrence School be made more habitable
for the pupils and the teachers. .
EVENING SCHOOLS

The evening schools have had successful year despite

the fact that the enrolment has not been up to the numbers
of former years. This is due to decreased immigration, the
ease with which employment is obtained, the draft and general war conditions. These schools offer instruction to
illiterate minors, to pupils of elementary school grading,
and to students who wish to study the higher branches, the
trades, and home economics in evening school work.
Especial mention should be made of the work of the commercial department in the Evening High School and the
class in naturalization and citizenship, which organizes in
January of each year in preparation for the receiving of
first naturalization papers late in February.
WORK OF REORGANIZATION

In special report in this volume and in the report of
the Superintendent of Schools the work of reorganizing the
public school system is explained in detail. It is enough
to say here that, after much consideration by the School
Board and the Superintendent, it has been determined to
abolish the ninth grade and to reorganize our schools and
courses of study on basis of twelve vears, not including
kindergartens. The plan determined upon is the so-called
  or junior high school plan. The educational advantages of this reorganization are very many, and the disadvantages are negligible. The plan is sure to be very
great improvement over the present plan. When the work
of reorganization, which is progressing satisfactorily and
conservatively, is completed, Holyoke will take her place
among the most modern school systems of the country.

: REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
CLOSING OF EAST DWIGHT STREET SCHOOL
Conditions of attendance, over which the School Board

had no control, caused, in September  the closing of the

East Dwight Street School. The district is served by two :

schools, the East Dwight Street School and the West Street

School, in both of which attendance was rather low. The

closing of the former and the transferring of its pupils to the

latter resulted in very good attendance in all the rooms at
the West Street School. The Superintendent placed regular teachers from the East Dwight Street School in rooms
in other schools where there were substitute teachers, and
then dropped the substitutes from service. Just what use
will be made of the closed building cannot now be determined.
THE JANITOR SERVICE

The school janitor is custodian of the school buildings
and property. large part of the responsibility for the
condition of these rests upon him. The janitor service in
school buildings is improving. In most: buildings during
the year just passed the service was very satisfactory. It
is the intention of this Board to take every step towards
further improvement in the safeguarding and caretaking of
school buildings and property.

HEALTH AND THE SCHOOL CHILD

Since most school pupils are compelled by law to attend school, it is the duty of school boards to see that the
health of these pupils is safeguarded. The local School

Board gave special attention to this matter in March  

when the Department of School Hygiene was organized.

following complete and expert survey, and following  

special act of the Massachusetts Legislature. The work of

health and physical education in the schools has been carried forward most successfully, although, during the past
year, the original working force has undergone serious

changes on account of resignations and war service. The
most important school board action relative to this work
last year was the election of school nurse. The nurse  s
able to visit, on regular schedule, ten buildings. This is |
heavy assignment. She is ‘‘on eall’’ for eight other buildings, and for all the parochial schools of the city. It is
necessary, in order that this work be carried forward successfully, to choose at least one other school nurse. It is
hoped that some work in dental hygiene can be done this )
year. ;
THRIFT

This is the time to impress upon school children the
necessity of thrift. In fact, the laws of Massachusetts require that thrift be taught in the public schools. The first |
step in this matter was taken when the School Board organized, some time ago, complete system of school savings
banks in the various schools. The home and school garden
movement has been developed with exceptional success. In
some of the upper grades and in the High school great ,
deal of work in home economics is being done. very
late development along the lines of thrift is the sale in the
schools of thrift stamps. The purchase of sixteen of these
stamps means that pupil has purchased what has been
termed ‘‘A Baby Liberty Bond.’’ It is essential that th's
great lesson be taught especially well this year.

SCHOOL EXHIBIT

Last May in the City Hall there was three-days free
public exhibit of all branches of school work. It placed
before the public most effectively the organization, grading, studies, regular and special work of the entire schoo!
system. The total attendance amounted to more than ha!f
the entire population of the city. Holyoke found out what
her schools are doing.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
SUMMER SESSION OF HIGH SCHOOL

This was most successful educational ‘‘venture.’’? Instruction for six weeks term of thirty morning sessions
was offered in make-up work, advanced subjects, college
entrance work and commercial branches. small nominal
tuition fee was charged, to make the students realize the
value of the privileges offered rather than to meet the expenses of the school. The summer session met real need.
Classes were organized in any subjects for which class —
of reasonable size made request. One of the secrets of the
success of the summer season was the ability of the teachers chosen, and the splendid service which they rendered.
A second summer session is planned for  .

MOTION PICTURE EQUIPMENT FOR THE HIGH
SCHOOL ,

This Board feels that the High School Auditorium
should be equipped with dark curtains, screen, booth and
motion picture apparatus. Such an equipment for use by
the various schools, by the various societies and organizations of the city, and by the general public would fill a
real need. The expense involved would be negligible when
compared with the pleasure and educational benefit which
pupils, teachers and parents would obtain.

PLAY SPACE FOR THE ELM STREET SCHOOL

This Board recommends the purchase of the Fenton
property, adjacent to the Elm Street School. Several reasons for this recommendation may be offered, any one of
which would seem sufficient. The school is in crowded
district, situated near two dangerous cross streets, and will
Probably be used as an elementary school building for |
great many years. The building is shut in on all sides excepting to the south, where the Fenton property is situated.
The only play space for the pupils of the Elm Street )
School is small lot to the south of the school, part of

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

which is taken up by brick storehouse used by the Board
of Public Works, and another part of which is used as a
driveway to this storehouse. The pupils have no other play
space save the road.

Furthermore, it is most necessary that the city should
protect itself against the erection of garage or an apartment block on what is now the Fenton property. The erec-.
tion of an apartment block would shut out the sunlight and
darken the rooms of the school building to such an extent
as to make the use of artificial light necessary great part
of the school day. most conclusive argument would
seem to be the fact that the purchase of this property would
cost the city but little actual money. The School Board
now pays  year for office rent. This sum would borrow good share of the money needed to purchase the
Fenton property. The building could then be used as a
school department office, and the fence on the back line of
the property could be moved south in line with the back of
the house, thus adding play space of about four thousand
square feet to the Elm Street School grounds.

For details of educational work and improvements,  
well as statistics covering finance, attendance and other
matters relating to the organization, administration, supervision and general running of this department, we refer
you to the report of the Superintendent of Schools.

PART III
REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT
To the School Board of Holyoke:
Your Superintendent herewith submits report of the
Holyoke public schools for the year  This is his sixth
annual report, and the fifty-fourth volume in the series of
printed reports issued by the School Board. |
FOREWORD
The aim of this report is to discuss very briefly and
generally many matters relating to the work, progress, accomplishments, administration, features and needs of the
school system; and additionally, to make certain recommendations for the year  Many topics must be considered, but only in their essential points. The details may he
found in other parts of this volume or may be obtained at
the offices of the School Board.
ATTENDANCE
From to there was an increase in the mem- ,
bership of the public schools amounting to seven and threefifths per cent; in there was practically no change; .
in there was decrease of three and three-tenths per
cent; in December the membership was slightly larger 
than in the previous December. :
The attendance figures since have been unsatisfac.
tory. The membership of our schools should grow steadily by about two per cent per year. And yet, there is much
encouragement in the fact that the attendance of those

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
within the compulsory school age, seven to fourteen years, is
better than ever. The falling off is in the group over fourteen years of age. This may be charged to war conditions,
the draft, and attractive wages now paid in the industrial
world.
FINANCES
For the fiscal year which ended November 
this Department received the sum of All of
- this sum was expended. The estimates for call for an
increase of approximately This additional sum  s
needed to meet the regular automatic increases in salaries
and the proposed new salary schedules for grade teachers
and for janitors.
ACCOMMODATIONS
In general the school buildings and property are  
reasonably good condition. However, there are buildings
in which important improvements are needed. Your Supetintendent would recommend thorough investigation of
our school accommodations with view to obtaining improvements and repairs that appear most necessary. The
recommendations on this subject made in the report of the
School Board need not be repeated here.  
The Schoolhouse Agent in Part of this volume presents detailed report on buildings, accommodations, janltor service and related matters. ;
THE SALARY QUESTION
The question of salary increases for those engaged in
public school work may be considered from at least two
viewpoints. In the first place the teaching profession is Very
much underpaid. This point is conceded by all who have
studied comparative salary schedules. Secondly, it is fact
that the average monthly prices of ninety-six most used atticles of food, shelter and clothing have increased eighty
and two-tenths percent from January to July  .
— |

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
One dollar in July purchased only as much as fifty-five
cents bought in January  Few wage or salary schedules have been increased at this rate—least of all the salaries of teachers. The School Board therefore las felt
justified in increasing salaries.
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS

Under this heading are grouped the kindergartens and
the first six grades. To these schools the most important
work of the entire system is assigned. Last year this work
was done with more than ordinary success, despite the late
opening of schools and the demands made upon the teachers
and principals by the School Exhibit. This year promises
to be the most important in the history of our elementary
schools, because they are in process of most efficient reorganization.

The various principals and teachers are working on
many committees, in charge of Miss Jennie E. Scolley, Acting Supervising Principal. The task of these committees
is to revise all the courses of study in the first six grades,
so that the work of the elementary schools will be more
uniform and definite throughout the city, and will articulate with the curriculum of the junior high schools. These
new courses of study will be in effect in September  ,
when the six year unit will be regularly established.

JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS

The use of this term anticipates the organization of
these schools in the various districts of the city. Such organization has not been completed, as the reader will learn
from the history of the junior high school movement in Holyoke, which appears in Part IX of this volume.

At this time the only junior high school work in the
city, completely organized on the basis of full school year,

‘ may be found in the four junior (seventh grade) classes
in the Lawrence School. Committees of principals and

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
teachers are at work on courses of study for all three years
of the junior high schools.

On February  certain changes were made in the
eighth grade of the grammar schools, so-called, in order
that the transfer to junior high school organization may
be more readily effected.

SPECIAL NINTH GRADES

The Lawrence School, in September  and the Highland and the Metcalf Schools, in September  organized
special ninth grades. The object of the special grade is to
do the work of the ninth grade and large part of the work
of the first year of the high school in one year. This object has actually been accomplished. Thus it is proved that
a ninth grade, as it is termed locally, is unnecessary. Additionally, tool has been provided for re-organization on
the ‘‘six-three-three’’ plan by ‘‘elimination at the top’’—a
tool quite as useful as that provided by the reconstruction
of the work of the seventh, year.

THE HIGH SCHOOL
Principal Conant has made complete report on the
| High School, which report is published as Part IV of this
volume. Returns from higher institutions; comparisons
with other high schools; and the Survey Reports of the
State Board of Education indicate that the Holyoke High
School has set and maintained high standards. The usefulness of the school was considerably increased during the
summer by the opening of extension courses for six weeks
in any subjects for which group of students might apply.

SPECIAL DEPARTMENTS

In Part of this volume your Superintendent presents excerpts from the reports of supervisors of the special
departments of manual training, household arts, drawing,
writing and music. The work of these departments was an outstanding feature of the School Exhibit. Some of these

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
departments have risen splendidly to the demands for a
change of work to aid nation at war.

In the absence of the Director of School Hygiene, Dr.
Walter F. Cobb, and of his temporary successor, Mr. John |
P. Whalen, your Superintendent, in Part VII of this volume,
presents the report of the special department of School
Hygiene.

| EVENING SCHOOLS

In the elementary evening schools, the work has been
very satisfactory despite the poor attendance. It was
necessary to combine the Whiting and Lawrence evening
schools—an action that would have been impossible in normal times, when immigration was regular and war conditions unknown.

The Evening High School has added another vear of
progress and success to its long record of accomplishment.

: Principal Garvey’s complete report is in Part of this
volume.
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION

The Holyoke Vocational School, with its day classes for
boys, its evening classes in trades and practical arts for
men and women respectively, its war emergency work and
its special summer classes will be reported upon in detail in
the annual volume of the Board of Trustees for Vocational
Education.

REORGANIZATION OF SCHOOL SYSTEM

The reorganization of the school system is about to be- come an accomplished fact. The Committee on Reorganization in June filed report which made educational
history in Holyoke. This report is published as Part IX
of this volume. In September principals and teachers were
organized into committees to revise the various courses
of study both for the elementary schools, embracing the —
first six grades, and for the proposed junior high schools,

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
embracing the next three years. To give details of this
project would confuse the reader. It is enough to explain
that in June the first junior high school class will be
graduated, with full three years’ junior high school
course, with adequate preparation to complete the senior
high school course in three years, with decidedly better
training, and with the saving of one year of school life.
COURSES OF STUDY

The courses of study followed in our elementary and
grammar schools, which courses are now being reconstructed on the ‘‘six and three’’ basis, received unique justification late in  In the summary volume of the ‘‘Cleveland School Survey,’’ the most remarkable school survey
conducted in this country, the seventh chapter treats
‘‘“What the Schools Teach and Might Teach.’’ The courses
of study in effect in the Holyoke schools for the past two
years practically embraced all the essential recommendations made in this chapter.

SCHOOL EXHIBIT

The free exhibit of school work held in City Hall on
May  and was, in certain sense, the educational feature of our school year. The visitors saw objectively what the schools are doing; by whom, how, when
and why these things are done; how much they cost; and
whether they are done with economy, efficiency and suc- |
cess. To the teaching force of the city the exhibit brought
the important lesson that the courses of study should be
made more uniform and definite. To the citizens came the
realization that the schools of to-day have vastly more duties, obligations and interests than the schools of yesterday,
and that teaching has grown to be profession.

SCHOOL EXPENDITURES
In the report of last year, your Superintendent disa
REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
, cussed at length the question of school expenditures. Six
important conclusions were reached, all of which were based
on municipal and state reports. Any one or two of these
conclusions might have had no weight, if the remaining
conclusions were not stated and proved. All six conclusions,
stated and verified, pointed to one main fact—that school
expenditures in this city are relatively no greater, and in
most cases less, than in the large majority of the cities of
Massachusetts with which Holyoke may reasonably be compared.
THRIFT

During the year every effort was made to form and
encourage habits of thrift among the pupils. This work was
done with marked success along two well known lines:

 School savings banks, in which total deposits to
date amount to approximately  ;

 Home and School Gardens, in which project Holyoke ranked fourth in Massachusetts.

In December plans were made for the sale of United
States Thrift Stamps in the schools. At this writing the
sales per week have exded the expected sales per month
—a splendid tribute to the thrift and patriotism of the
school pupils.

CONVENTION OF PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS ,

The eighth annual convention of the Massachusetts
Branch of the National Congress of Mothers and ParentTeacher Associations was held in Holyoke in October  .
A splendid program was presented. Many national officers, together with delegates from all the New England
states, were in attendance. The various addresses and papers made profound impression upon the publie and the
delegates alike, and gave impetus to the work, already well
begun, in Holyoke.

. EDUCATION AND THE WAR

Our Country is in world war, which has caused revision of philosophies, view-points, boundaries, military
science—indeed revision. of life itself. In this crucial time
it is essential that education, the most fundamental thing
in life, should be maintained at its highest point of efficiency,
subject only to the demands of national defense. Whether
the war promises to be short or long the schools should continue with their regular work. For, in the days to come,
young men and young women of training will be called upon

to serve their Country and her defenders in ways unknown
to us now. The present school work should not necessarily

| PLANS FOR  

In closing this part of the report it is asked that the
School Board give earnest consideration to the following
recommendations:

 That extension classes be held at the High School
for period of six weeks during the summer of  that
the work of last summer be broadened to include pupils of
the last two years of the grammar schools; and that special
classes in war emergency work be organized.

 That ‘‘steamer classes,’’ so-called, be organized in
several schools. These classes are for children who do not

, speak English and who are therefore misfits in regular
classes. Such children are handicap to the others in the
grade. They should be given special opportunity to acquire the English language rapidly.

 That, in view of the success of the school orchestras not only in rendering services to the schools and the
community, but especially on account of the benefits derived by the individual pupils, this feature of our special
work be extended to all grammar schools.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

 That the Fenton property at the corner of Elm and
Suffolk Streets be purchased for use by the School Department.

.. That in one of the South Holyoke schools special
help class for typical children, similar to the class at the
Elm Street School, be organized at an early date.

 That the School Board again assist the Chamber of
Commerce in its community garden work by operating these
gardens as state-aided agricultural department of the
High School.

 That the work of re-writing and publishing in better form the rules of the School Board be completed at an
early date.

 That the School Board publish and adopt ‘‘The Holyoke Citizens’ Book’’—a book on local community civics
compiled by students of Mount Holyoke College, the Chamber of Commerce and the School Board.

 That second school nurse be elected in the department of School Hygiene and that some work in dental
hygiene be established. ,

 That all work in household arts and household
science in the grades and in the High School be correlated.

CONCLUSION

Your Superintendent wishes to thank the supervisors,
principals and teachers for their increasingly valuable work ;
to thank the city departments and city officials, especially
the Board of Aldermen, the Board of Public Works, the
Board of Health, the Public Library, the City Auditor, the
City Clerk and the Inspector of Public Buildings for their
co-operation; and most especially to express his gratitude
to the members of the School Board for the hearty support accorded to their executive officer.

Respectfully submitted,

Superintendent of Schools.

PART IV
REPORT OF THE PRINCIPAL OF
| THE HIGH SCHOOL

To the Superintendent of Schools: |

 herewith submit my twelfth annual report. In it I
make note of some of the work done in the past year, of
some that is now being done, and of certain plans and

recommendations looking to the future.

The High School enrolment has been seriously affected
by industrial conditions, due, in the main, to the World
War. The enrolment in September was about one hundred less than in September  Many pupils have withdrawn during the school year to go to work. Wages in shops
and offives are attractive to the pupils of high school age. Iu
homes where the wage earner has enlisted or has been
drafted the high school pupil must take his place at the desk
or inthe shop. These conditions must continue more or less
during the war. While there is necessity in many eases for
the boy or girl to become supporting member of the family, there has also been no time in our history ‘when the
education of the youth has been more important. Some of
our boys have left school to enlist in the Army or Navy.
Where voung man feels it his patriotic duty to serve his
country it  difficult and sometimes inadvisable to persuade
him to remain in school. All schools and colleges where
boys of military age are enrolled must face the situation and
realize that large number of the active, intelligent young
men of this country are needed, and needed at onee, if the

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
country is to be successful in bringing the war to speedy
and successful end.

The work in the school has felt the influences of the
times. Last spring number of boys were released for farm
work at the request of the Massachusetts Public Safety
Committee. In most cases the boys proved faithful to their
tasks and the farmers were much pleased with the results.
The State honored the boys by enrolling them, giving them
suitable badges and certificates of honorable dismissal when
their term of service was over. Later the United States
recognized their services by also giving them badges and
certificates. There is no doubt that more boys will be
needed this spring, summer and fall for farm work. The
names of the boys enlisting in farm work and receiving
state and national recognition for the same were Burdette
Poland, John Merriman, Donald Moriarty and Eugene. McCarthy. The Principal has been appointed Enrolling Officer
by the State and has this matter in charge locally. One of
the teachers is taking course, under the authority of the
State, in Camp Supervision so that he may be able to supervise group of High School boys in some camp where

| they will be situated so as to work on nearby farms. This
has been successfully undertaken in some places in the
eastern part of the State. No doubt it will be quite general
this summer. |

One of the new efforts was the establishing of Summer Session. This lasted for six weeks. The number enrolled was and out of this number only two withdrew,
the others remaining for practically the entire session.
Seven teachers were employed for the full time, and one
for part time. Courses were offered in Commercial
Branches, English, Latin, Modern Languages, Science and
Mathematics. The hours of the school were from to

| in the morning, pupils coming and going as their
class hours permitted. As the class rooms were in the main

| REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

located on the north side of the building, the weather conditions, except for few days, did not seriously affect the
work of the school. The pupils who attended came for a
variety of purposes. Some came to make up work in which
they had failed; some to take work for advanced standing;
others to make up college entrance conditions; while still
others came to gain knowledge of Stenography and Typewriting for office purposes or for assistance in their college
work. Some of the pupils were from the ninth grade while
others were college graduates. The enrolment was much
in excess of expectations and it is probable that the summer
of will see even larger and more successful school.
As each pupil paid small fee, the actual cost to the city
was only about  per capita. It can be said, both from
educational and financial viewpoints, that the Summer
Session proved success.

The work with the College Preparatory pupils, more
particularly for the girls attending the women’s colleges in
New England, has undergone some change. With the fall
of these colleges will admit only by examinations and,
while retaining the same requirements for admission, examinations will be given in four subjects, the choice, in
part, to rest with the candidate. This will necessitate, in
addition to maintaining about the same course of study, a
more intensive teaching in the last year of the College Preparatory work in the subjects that will be offered for examination. As this will vary with the individual it will necessitate smaller groups and an increased number of teachers
engaged in College Preparatory work.

As there is an appeal at the present time for more practical study after graduation, it will be noticed that brief
summary of the members of the class who were graduated

| in June shows that many more have entered institutions where courses lead to specific vocations. Among such
schools attended by the members of this class are: Pratt
Institute, Skidmore School of Arts, Simmons College, MasREPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
sachusetts General Hospital, St. Mary’s Training School for
Nurses, Tufts Medical School, Sargent School of Physical
Education, New York Art School, schools of music and secretarial schools. In addition to these special schools or departments of schools many of the class are in local offices,
drafting rooms and various business positions. The following colleges and schools are also represented by the
members of this class: Smith, Mount Holyoke, Massachusetts Agricultural College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dartmouth, Amherst, Harvard, Holy Cross, Brown,
St. Lawrence College, Worcester Polytechnic Institute,
Washington Catholic University, Tufts, Union and Yale;
Westfield, Bridgewater and North Adams Normal Schools.
Only few reports have been received so far from the colleges and schools showing the work done by pupils who entered in September  Such reports as have been received are very Satisfactory. One technical college writes, ‘‘One
of your boys entering stands among the highest in the
freshman class.’’ The report received from the New England College Board last vear shows that there were no
failures of pupils entering colleges in September  .

 It may be more or less natural that there should be some
criticism of the college work done by the graduates of a
high school, but when it is taken into consideration that the
main function of high school is not to prepare pupils for |
college, and that most of the pupils in high school do not
intend to go to college, such criticism appears unjust and,
in the main, offered without intelligent consideration of all
the facts. The College Preparatory courses are based on
college requirements and graded from year to year on the
natural progression necessary to meet the demands of colleges admitting students either on examination or by certificate. It will be seen from the list that our graduates
readily meet entrance requirements of all our more important institutions of higher learning and are also able to
carry on successfully the advanced work demanded in

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

these colleges or technical schools. With very few exceptions all of the members of the faculty in this school are
eollege graduates and, in addition, have carried on their
study in universities and summer schools.

The various courses of study remain, except for certain specific applications, about the same as they were a
year ago. In Household Arts and Domestic Science much
practical work has been done. In the Sewing classes certain periods have been devoted to Red Cross work, this
being done both during the school hours in the regular class
room and outside of school hours at the Red Cross Rooms.
In the Cooking classes particular attention has been paid
to food conservation and the preparation of foods along the
line of Mr. Hoover’s recommendations. The response of the
girls in these two departments convinces one that we may
depend upon them for any work that may be in their power
to perform. In the History classes particular attention has
been given to the study of European history with the
eauses, both present and remote, leading up to the war.
Special emphasis  being made in the classes in National
Life and Community Civics, in the teaching of good citizenship and the duties of all citizens in the present crisis.
The work in National Life follows closely the recommendation of the Bureau of Education in its advanced
course, while that of Community Life is based upon text
book and the more elementary course recommended by the
‘Commissioner of Education. We are bringing the Mechanical Drawing classes and classes in Art into closer relations with the demands of the present day without sac, rificing the artistic attributes of these subjects. There is a
demand in the industrial world for young men and women
who can give expression to their ideas through drawing or
drafting. Some of the local stores, offices and shops are
using many of our former pupils along lines of this kind.
This is especially true of one large concern that is now

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
employing seventeen former pupils in their drafting room.
This ineludes both young men and women. We are trying
to prepare our pupils so that it will not be necessary for
their employers co spend so long time in the training stage
of their emplo,ment. The seope of the High School courses
was broadencd and extended at the beginning of the second
half of this year by opening certain courses to voung men
and women who were not regularly enrolled pupils of the
High School. So far the only classes that organized for
extension work are those in Stenography and Typewriting.
Courses will also be offered in the Household Arts and
Drawing departments when need arises. The intention of
this work is to make the High School funetion with the
demands of the times by using the High Sehool plant to aid
not only the boy and girl of high school age but all those
who might be benefitted by any instruetion that can be
sultably given. here.

One of the unusual but timely events of the vear was
the exercises connected with the presentation and display
of the service flag. This flag was presented by the girls in
the **Q’’ Club and at the same time national flag of similar size was given by the boys of the Phi Alpha. Much
credit is to be given to Mr. Moriarty of the faculty who ecollected many of the facts about the boys who had enlisted
and who secured from many sources large proportion of

The Vocational School is co-operating in establishing
courses in Machine Shop Practice and Printing. Some of

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

our boys, seeing the value of these branches, have responded
to the generous attitude of the Vocational School Director
by enrolling in these subjects. These classes are carried on
in the afternoon. These boys are receiving instruction that
will assist them both in preparation for technical schools and
in the practical affairs of life.

In the change of the school system from nine to eight

| years of elementary school work and the establishing of
the junior high schools in the various buildings, some readjustment may be necessary in the High School. By the
time the system is in full operation the High School will
be able to meet the new conditions satisfactorily. It might
be wise to have both three and four year College Preparatory course following the one year of High School
work completed in the junior high school. Many pupils who
desire to take subjects not directly in the College Course,
but subjects in which the pupil has special aptitude, now
either must neglect or give up college preparation. believe many girls would be benefitted by work in our Domestie Science and Art departments, and many boys in Shop
Work and Mechanical Drawing, and both boys and girls in
“ommunity Civies and General Science courses. All these
subjects the College Preparatory pupil cannot take if he is
to meet in four years all requirements. pupil would be
in school no longer than he is under the present system and
in addition would be better qualified not only for the demands of college work, but for the practical demands of
everyday life.

It has been possible, through some of the money saved
in our Lecture Course Fund, to establish fund for assisting some of our graduates in entering and continuing their

work in college. This, however, is so small an amount that
it does not go very far in the direction for which it was |
intended. If fund could be established either by the
School Board or through private agencies for the assisting of worthy pupils to continue college course, great

, REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
good would result and some of our best students would be
able to go to college and successfully complete college

- eourse. would like to see something done this year in
starting such fund.

One of the questions that is more or less live issue
in all high schools is that of the hours of school sessions.
Four years ago the session in this school was lengthened
from five to five and one-half hours. The periods were
ehanged from six to five, one hour given to each period.
It would be difficult now to change from the hour period.
This, in part, is due to the fact that the Physical Training
work is carried on in separate building. To provide for
sufficient time for floor work an hour period is required. The
hour period assists greatly in the making of schedule that
accommodates the unprepared work of the school, such as
Manual Training and Domestic Science. The greatest
benefit, however, believe, is the division of the time in the
class room allowing for both the recitation and supervised
study. Many of our teachers use the study period of the
hour advantageously in assisting the pupils in more intelhgently understanding the lesson for the following dav.
This plan of supervised study is comparatively new but |
more and more the interest in this phase of school management  growing and more and more are schools adopting
plans similar to the one used in this school. The change
of our school session, which begins at and closes at
 is one that might well deserve serious consideration.
A committee of the faculty appointed last year made an
investigation of the schools throughout the United States
on the question of length of session and the number of
periods in the school day. It was found that the session

| varied in length from four hours and thirty minutes to
eight hours. The longer session schools are generally
known as the two platoon plan; certain pupils attending the
morning session and others the afternoon session. In fourteen high schools in Massachusetts the length of session va REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
ried from four hours and thirty minutes to six hours and
fifteen minutes. In six other New England high schools
outside of Massachusetts the length of session varied from
four hours and forty-five minutes to six hours.

- Experience justifies me in saying that five hours and
thirty minutes is long for continuous session. believe
some change in the arrangement of our hours would be to
the advantage of both pupils and teachers. The change
that might be made would be to have school open at  ,
as it does at present, followed by four one hour periods,
ending the fourth period at  At this time allow for
an intermission of forty-five minutes, beginning again at
one o'clock with two periods in the afternoon and closing at
three o'clock. There are certain difficulties in this arrangement, but believe the advantages would be great. Pupils
who had no elasses the fourth period might be allowed to
vo home to return at the opening of the fifth period at one
o'clock, or pupils who had no elasses the fifth hour might be
excused to return at two o’clock. In this way many pupils
who live at distance from the school could go home for
the mid-day meal and all nearby pupils would, in the fortyfive minute intermission, enjoy the same privilege. As we
now have only five periods many pupils cannot take work
which they need but which is not in their regular course.

. With six periods this would be different. The teachers who
now return certain afternoons for assisting pupils could
do most of this work during some of the periods in the regular session. With such an arrangement the teacher then
could more readily require prompt make-up work, following
absences or neglect of study. Pupils who need to go to
work before the regular hour of dismissal could have their ,
programs arranged so they would be excused at two o’clock |
or even earher, if necessary. Space prevents going into
further detail, but believe this plan to be better adapted to
the pupils and teachers and to the demands of modern
high school program. would like to see this program tried

at least one day in the week for part of this school year.
We could then tell how it would work out in practice.

Changes in our faculty were as follows: Mrs. Elisabeth I. Perkins, Supervisor of Sewing and teacher of Sewing in the High School, resigned to accept similar position in the Smith School, Northampton. She was  sucded by Miss Teresa L. Dowd, teacher in the grades in
this city. Miss Frances M. Pattison, teacher of Stenography ,
and Typewriting, resigned at the close of the year and was
sucded by Miss Emily Cate, teacher in the Braintree
High School. Mr. Harry Wilcox was given leave of ab- —
sence to enlist in the Engineering Department of the Army
as an expert photographer and map sketcher. He was
sucded by Mr. Jeremiah Ganey, graduate of Amherst
College who had been teaching in the Charlestown High
School. Mr. Edwin Keough resigned to accept position
in Catholic Seminary in Rochester at considerable increase in salary. This position was filled by Mr. William R.
Peck, graduate of Holy Cross College with experience in
both school and office work. Mr. Henderson was granted
a leave of absence as he enlisted in the Aviation Section of
the Army. Mrs. Henderson, who has had long experience
in teaching commercial subjects, has taken his place. Mr.
Edgeworth resigned to accept position as head of the
Commercial Department in the Fall River High School. His
place has been filled by Mr. Harold F. King, graduate of
Bowdoin, who came here from the Fort Wayne, Indiana,
High, School, where he had charge of the Commercial Department. Mr. John P. Whalen is now Assistant Physical ,
Director of Camp Devens. His place has been taken by Mr.
Arthur Ayer, formerly coach and instructor in Norwich
University.

The school orchestra has been placed on more satisfactory working basis. The hours of the orchestra are now
during the school time and all members of the orchestra
have the same relation to this subject as they have to any

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
other class. The progress made this year has been more
marked than in any one year since the orchestra was organized. The plan to give credit for work done in outside
music, recommended in my last report, has gone into effect.
A number of pupils have asked to receive credit this year.
This will be done if they meet the conditions required.

| They must submit detailed statement of their work and
give demonstration before some responsible musician,
who will determine whether the pupil has met the conditions laid down.

| In the Prize Speaking Contest, Harold Martin, member of the class of  received first prize. He represented the school in the contest in White Plains, but was
not successful in qualifying for the final interscholastic contest which was held at Hamilton College in Clinton, New
York.

The honor pupils for were divided into two
groups. The high honor pupils were Gertrude Cassidy,
Marion Kane, Freda Ricker, Austin Kirkpatrick, Philip .
O’Brien, Kathryn Kelly, Cecelia Cox and Bessie Kaplinsky.
The second honor pupils were Florence Turner, Helen Begley, Eleanor Dolan, Edmond Lapointe, Priscilla Healey,
Helen Gorman, Helena Kelly, Bridget Fitzgerald, Theresa
McCarthy, Ruby Holley, Bernard Fitzgerald and Leontine
Menard.

A new arrangement was put into effect in the fall of
  in the method of placing pupils in sections or home
rooms. An attempt is being made to place the pupil in
closer relation with certain teachers, that is, to have teachers responsible for and acquainted with the needs of a
certain group of pupils. Section teachers will remain with
pupils during the pupils’ first three years in school. It had
been the practice to change pupils’ section teachers every
year. Already certain favorable results are noticed and
the interest of many pupils is permanently aroused. Of

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
course it will take two or three years to give fair estimate of the way in which the plan works out.

While there are many demands upon our citizens for
supporting one war cause or another, yet believe that it
is very important that some steps should be taken at once
to secure an athletic field. Next fall the Springfield-Hol| yoke football game will be played in Holyoke. This has
now become more than school affair. The annual attendance for the last three years averaged about six thousand. There is no suitable field in Holyoke on which to play
this game. This alone would not be sufficient reason for
the field but it is also needed to encourage greater de- .
velopment and more general school participation in

sports. Ifa field could be obtained so that it would be held
by the Athletic Association, with certain safeguards and
supervision, admission fees could be charged. This has
worked out very well in many places in this State. believe Holyoke would support such measure if it were
properly started.

The first athletic meet under the auspices of the State |
High School Masters’ Club will occur this year. The contestants have been classified into three groups: Juniors,
Intermediates and Seniors. This meet will be held in Boston and should attract large number of boys from different
parts of the State. By making these classifications all boys
of high school age should be interested as they will not
compete against boys who outclass them in size and age.
Our system of Physical Education in Holyoke can very
readily adjust itself to the plan of this High School meet.
A larger number of boys should go into track athletics.
No better form of physical exercise can be encouraged.

. The Commercial Department has two suggestions to
offer which think important enough to place in my re- |
port here: First, that an up-to-date comptometer be installed in the department, so that each senior division may

 be instructed on same before they go out into the business

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
world this spring. We might add that we have had several
suggestions from local business men to the effect that we
ask for one of these machines; Second, we wish to call your
special attention to the fact that there are always two
grades of graduates in our Commercial Department, number and classifications, so to speak. In Class we find
students who are meeting the requirements of the depart- |
ment fully. These young people are the ones we recommend first. They are also the students we are obliged to
look to for the future standing of our department. We have
no trouble in finding places for this class of talent. Class
  includes the student who receives the High School diploma
on the same basis as Class but who is not, in the eyes of
the Commercial Department, so efficient. It is often the
ease that student in Class applies for position and
states his case to business man in such manner that
the business man believes the student to be of Class  
calibre. Likely he hjres the pupil without consulting us
and is greatly disappointed. Naturally this places our department in an embarrassing position and does an injustice to the students in Class  who have conscientiously
sought after and found the best results that the department has to offer.
I have not gone into detail in the other departments of
the school as there is nothing radical or unusual to report.
In conclusion would say that this report or any brief
report can give but small and unsatisfactory estimate
of what the High School is doing. In it an attempt has been
made to show that the effort now is to reduce our activities to present day values, to make our pupils more worthy,
more serviceable and more intelligently responsive to the
great world call for universal democracy.
Respectfully submitted,
HOWARD CONANT,
Principal of High School.

PART V
REPORTS OF THE SUPERVISORS

This section of the annual volume is devoted to exeerpts from reports of the supervisors of the special departments, with the exception of the report of the department of School Hygiene, which is presented in Part VHI.
Additionally, the reports of the Principal of the Evening
High, School and of the Schoolhouse Agent are ineluded in
this part.

The Supervisor of Manual Training, Robert BE. Hamill,
has made the following report:

‘‘The work in Manual Training during the past vear
has been marked by the most satisfactory progress made
in this department since its organization.

In the school vear survey of the situation
was made and definite course was determined upon. We
are now well on the way toward accomplishing the task set
for ourselves. In general, the main needs which we had to
meet were these: revision of the course of study; the
equipping of our shops; the revision of the teachers’
schedules; the addition of teachers to our corps; program
increasing the time allotted to Manual Training; and the
addition of another manual training center. Manual Training in grades  and now consists of instruction in wood
work, sheet metal work, cement work and printing, divided ;
by grades as follows: Grade  wood work and practical
sheet metal work; grade  wood work and cement work;
grade  printing. In the advisability of organizing
pre-vocational classes was considered and recommended,
but the possibility of reorganization of our school system

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

on the plan caused us to delay until such program
could be effected. With the recent adoption of the  
plan, we were able to begin our junior high school industrial work and develop our plans for pre-vocational training. The nucleus of the future industrial work under the
junior high school plan has been formed, and further development of the subjects in the course is only question
of time allotment.

We have equipped our first sheet metal working shop
at the Lawrence School. We expect that the equipment
and course of study at that school will serve as guide
when the time comes for the addition of such work in other
centers.

All manual training centers are now adequately
equipped for the work we are doing. The equipment has
been so planned that, with very few additions, all of the
work in Manual Training in the city can be changed to the
type most suitable for junior high school industrial work.

We have revised the teachers’ schedules, and, by the
addition of substitute teacher on half time, we have made
an arrangement which requires no teacher to work in more
than two centers or to have more than from fifteen to seventeen classes per week. The effect on teaching results and
on the upkeep of equipment is most satisfactory. By opening manual training center at the Lawrence School we
have made it possible for every class in Manual Training
in the city, with single exception, to receive instruction
in its own building.

The situation regarding Manual Training in the High
School is not satisfactory. We have done good work with
the small classes enrolled. No new lines of work can be
developed while the present five period schedule continues
to handicap pupils who wish to take shop work. The course
has been carefully outlined and our equipment, while
small, has been well chosen and has proved most satisfactory. We need to add one or two more machines to our



REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
equipment but conditions do not warrant such recommendations at present. The solution of the manual training problem lies in the change of the whole high school program from five period to six period day. We have
met with success in our effort to establish optional afternoon classes. However, the traditional one session plan
with afternoons free makes it impossible for the pupils who
plan to do outside work during their high school course to
take additional regular periods in the afternoon.”’

During the year, Mrs. Elisabeth I. Perkins, Supervisor
of Household Arts, resigned to take better position in the
Smith School at Northampton. The value of the services
rendered by Mrs. Perkins cannot be overestimated. As a
supervisor, teacher, disciplinarian and friend, she will be
greatly missed in our public schools.

Her successor, Miss Teresa L. Dowd, has taken up the
work with enthusiasm, and with definite plans andpollicies which augur well for the Household Arts department.

Owing to the change, report is not available and
perhaps not necessary at this time.

A feature of the work of the Drawing Department
this year has been its participation in two excellent exhibits.
Much of the work is described in the following excerpts
from the report of the Supervisor of Drawing, Mrs. Isabelle
H. Ferry:

““We have had two successful exhibits of the work
done under the direction of the Drawing Department dur- !
ing the past year. The first was in connection with the
School Exhibit last May. The second, held in December,
consisted largely of Red Cross work. The quality of ‘the
work exhibited spoke for itself. It seems unnecessary to
make any further report in this regard.

There are other matters, however, that need consideration. The close correlation of the work in Drawing and
Manual Training from grades one to five, inclusive, result of their being under the same head, made it possible

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
to secure satisfactory work with minimum amount of
time and effort. The case was different in grades six to
nine, inclusive. We required that the examples selected
, should illustrate, as far as possible, the standard that we desired to attain. But we found it much more difficult to obtain such examples. discouraging condition is the small
time allotment. Another obstacle to securing satisfactory
work is the fact that some principals and teachers seem to
take little interest in the subject. Another and  perhaps
unavoidable drawback is the poor quality of the supplies
furnished.

The Drawing department of the High School is at a
great disadvantage on account of the five period day. Most
pupils are required to take four regular academic studies,
and for the first two years they are required to take gyvmnasium work. It is almost impossible for them to find time
for art, no matter how much they may desire to do so. I
am sure that much larger number of pupils would elect
to take Drawing in the High School under the six period
plan. ,

The average work now accomplished falls below the
standard which we set. More time should be placed at our
disposal. It is most important that America should be prepared to supply her own designs for all kinds of manufactured goods in the commercial war to come. The public
schools should aid by fitting their pupils to meet this emergency. ,

I feel very strongly that if some of the grammar school
principals were little more impressed with the practical
importance of the work of this department in relation to
many of the common activities of life, our work in the upper grades could be strengthened, greatly to the advantage of the pupils.

.The work of the Drawing department is very often

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
favorably mentioned, but know that there are greater
heights before us which hope we may attain.”’

In the report of the Supervisor of Writing, Miss Esther
A. MacDonnell, one important request was made as follows: |

‘‘That the work in Writing be made more definite and
uniform throughout the schools by the printing of graded
course of study in the Palmer Method.”’

The Supervisor of Music, Mr. Hugh Craig, has made
the following report, in part:

‘‘The value of singing has been demonstrated by the
fact that in every soldiers’ camp, the Government has appointed conductors of music. Large choruses have been
formed and ‘singing armies’ are being trained. ;

The music in the elementary schools has followed the
outline of previous vears. Sight reading and tone production have been emphasized. During the year the pupils
have been called upon to sing on various occasions, such
as Memorial Day exercises, the School Exhibit, patriotic
celebrations, conventions of Parent-Teacher Associations
and at graduating exercises. The school orchestras are
doing creditable work. Special mention should be made
of the Joseph Metcalf School Orchestra.

- The High School classes are larger than usual. The
orchestra is having successful year, with membership

of about twenty. The senior class, augmented by some of

the junior class, studied and gave as concert in the High
School Hall the opera of ’I  Trovatore’ by Verdi. Professional soloists assisted, and the concert was enjoyed by a

large audience.’’

The following excerpts from the report of Principal
Garvey of the Evening High School contain several very
important recommendations:

‘‘The Evening High School has shown, to some extent,
the effect of the war on school attendance. The class which
will graduate in March is the smallest since  The
school has personal interest in the great conflict, for two

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

of the bots who were with us last year are now with Company in France, four others are members of the same
company, and many former students are in war service.

The Commercial department is emphasizing particularly this year the work in Stenography and Typewriting.
The beginners are doing well. In the advanced classes
drill on letter arrangement and speed work has been emphasized, and special attention given to the correct use of |
the tabulator and other devices.

The science work has been continued along the lines
of last year. The enrolment is relatively large, but the
number belonging diminishes rapidly. This is doubtless
due to insufficient previous preparation for the work. Young
boys and girls from the eighth grade are too immature to
grasp the significance of the principles underlying Physics
and Chemistry. The pupils who persevere are those who

have had some high school training or its equivalent.
Whether it would be worth while, for the purpose of retaining pupils, to offer more elementary course in one or both
classes is problematical. In small class it is easy to discover the purpose of thé student. The girls as rule tend
toward nursing and hospital work. Among the boys we
find some, who are apprentices in large manufacturing
plants, taking up the study at the direction of their superintendents. One student is preparing to enter the medical
school.

Modern language classes, with. the exception of the
elass in German, are doing satisfactory work. In the Spanish classes the members represent various occupations and
races, with ages ranging from fourteen to forty. It is the
purpose of the advanced pupils later to form Spanish
Club to disenss books and current topics in that language.

The school suffered distinct loss in the withdrawal
of Miss Lynn from the teaching foree. Under her instruction the work of the class in Freehand Drawing was made
intensely practical. Several boys followed up the work

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
in art schools and are now receiving substantial salaries
as result of their efforts here. The work of Miss Lynn
is being ably continued by her successor.

The Manual Training Classes were unusually popular
this year. Although the course appeals particularly to
young boys, several men of over thirty years of age took
up the work this year. There is splendid field for it in
this city. We should parallel the work we are now doing
with courses for women. These latter courses would in no
sense be antagonistic to or in competition with the Stateaided vocational classes for women. There are many who
would welcome instruction in certain household arts to
whom the vocational courses do not appeal. From the
many requests which have received personally IT know the
demand for such classes is strong and hope this department may be broadened or extended so as to include them
in the near future.

More than ever before we are impressed with the need

: of true appreciation of real American citizenship. wish
there could be established in this school Civies department which would be something more than mere perfunctory study of government. want to see course
which will teach the immigrant what he must know before he will be admitted to citizenship; instruct him im the
essentials of good citizenship; develop in him love for
America and reverence for her laws, her institutions and
her government. want also course which will teach
the native born American his obligations as citizen, and
make him thinking, intelligent citizen with proper appreciation of the highest ideals of citizenship. Then, too,
I would have instruction for women, for we must recognize the right of suffrage for women and we must prepare
our women for the exercise of it. Such department in
this school would result in immense benefit to the whole
community.’’

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

The report of the Schoolhouse Agent follows. The
essential recommendations of this report appear in Part II
of this volume.

. ‘During the vear we did our best to keep the buildings in sanitary and proper condition. With few ex- ceptions, the janitors did their work carefully and conscientiously. We have repaired furniture in different

buildings. New furniture was bought for the Highland,

Morgan, South Chestnut Street, Lawrence and Elm Street
Schools. ,

The High, Vocational, Joseph Metcalf, Kirtland,
Ewingville and Morgan Schools are in good condition. The
Nonotuck Street School is in fair condition, with the ex| ception of the furnaces. These ought to be replaced bv a
good boiler large enough to heat the whole building. This
would be measure of safety as well as economy. The
West Ilolyoke School has become inadequate for the district and new building is greatly needed. The Lawrence
School, though an old building, is still in fairly good con- :
dition. Eleetrie lights should be installed throughout the
building. The interior should be re-painted. The South
Chestnut Street School is in good condition, but the two
boilers are old and were condemned two years ago. During
severely cold weather it is very hard to keep the building
warm. It would be advisable to install two new boilers,
and to light the rooms by electricity. The William Whiting School is in good condition. The desks and chairs
need shellac and varnish. The Elm Street School is in fair
condition. Some of the furniture is old and should be replaced. Two new boilers should be installed. The present
boilers were condemned by the inspectors two years ago.
The class rooms and corridors at the Highland School
should be repainted. The Park Street School needs to be
painted. The furniture is in good condition with the
exception of that in one room. The interior of the Sargeant Street School needs painting. Electric lights should

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
be installed throughout the building. The furniture in the
Springdale School is old but if repaired would give better
service. The building altogether is in fair condition. The
condition of the Ingleside School is very good. If the
desks were varnished, it would protect them and give the
rooms much better appearance. At the Elmwood School
new sanitaries and boilers are badly needed. The boilers
were intended for an eight room building. After the addition was built, no extra boilers were provided. The
present heating plant is inadequate for the building. The
furniture, though old, is fairly good. The interior of the

— West Street School needs painting. Much of the furniture
needs repairing. In four rooms the present furniture is
not worth repairing and it is recommended that new furniture be purchased. The Hamilton Street School is badly
in need of repairs. All walls and ceilings should be painted.
The furniture is in very poor condition, and general repairs are urgently needed.

During the past year, owing to ill health, Mr. Frank
J. Schirch, janitor of the Hamilton Street School, peti. tioned the School Board for pension. The petition was
granted and Mr. William F. Morrison, formerly of the Vocational School, was transferred to fill the vacancy caused
by Mr. Schirch’s resignation.

A MEMORIAL ON THE DEATH OF
FRANCES M. GILDAY

By the death on January of Miss Frances M. Gilday,
the public schools of Holyoke have sustained real loss. For,
though another can of course be found to take her office, the
personality of each teacher, who has done well as such, must be
regarded, and no personality can be complete substitute for any
other personality in such situation. In some respects this is
particularly true in the kindergarten, where the character of the
first impressions made upon the minds of the children is matter of great importance.

Miss Gilday brought to her work, in addition to good technical training as kindergartner, striking presence and an attractive personality, which made her popular with her fellow
teachers and beloved by her pupils and their parents.

Appointed in as assistant in the Springdale kindergarten,
and as its director in  she was transferred in to the
Kirtland School, where she sucded to directorship made
difficult to fill by reason of the high efficiency of her predecessor.
But the testimony is at hand that she did not fail to measure
up to the exacting requirements of the situation. :

The School Board, duly sensible of its loss of faithful and
efficient servant by th  death of Miss ildeyv, and  desiring to
record its appreciation of her nearly sixteer vears of continuous
service to the schools of Holyoke, instructs the Secretary to
make entry of this memorial upon the records of the Board, and
to send copy of the same to the members of her family. .

PART VII
DEPARTMENT OF SCHOOL HYGIENE
To the School Board of Holyoke: 

In the absence of the Director of School Hygiene, Dr.

| Walter F. Cobb, who resigned during the vear, your Superintendent has undertaken the task of reporting for this special department.

In view of the most thorough and comprehensive report
made by Dr. Cobb last year, and since our time and efforts
are devoted to carrying out the provisions of his remarkable
report, it seems proper in this report to deal only with the
general situation, and to offer excerpts from reports of va, ous members of the department of School Hygiene. 

The loss of Dr. Cobb, and the resignation of Mr. Kelly,
Physical Director of the High School, coming almost at the
same time, seriously handicapped our work. Dr. Cobb was

. the directing organizing head, who could perform any duty
required in the department—whether that of medical  spector, teacher, lecturer, physical director or coach. The
demand for men of his calling and ability in the great sys
tem of physical education recently organized in the state of
New York, and the opportunities open for war service, made
it impossible to find suitable successor. For Mr. Kelly’s
place, Mr. John P. Whalen was chosen. Within short time
he was called to military service and Mr. Arthur R. Ayer
was engaged to substitute for him.

The work of the department was reorganized te™porarily. Some of the work done by Dr. Cobb was assigned
to others, and some of it was dropped for the time bei &Dy. H. E. Miner was made Medical Director and placed in
charge of all medical supervision. Mr. L. K. Appel was  

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
signed the additional duties of supervising the teaching of
hygiene in the grades. Miss Ruth Yoerg was made parttime assistant to Mr. Appel. An assistant, part-time, was

furnished to the Physical Director at the High School.
These and few minor adjustments have made it possible
to continue the work, without great loss in efficiency, through
this school year.

A report of this kind might deal with many topics. Perhaps the following form fairly complete list:

Organization of the Department.

Medical Supervision. oo

The Teaching of Hygiene.

The Work in Epidemiology.

Schoolhouse Sanitation.

Physical Education.

Physical Training. ,

Duties of School Physicians and Nurses.

Duties of Principals and Teachers. ,

Duties of Janitors.

Forms and Cards Used.

Supervised Athletics.

Dental Hygiene. |

To avoid lengthy report, but few of these topics will
be considered. They will be presented as excerpts from
many reports submitted.

The following is report made by the Medical Director,
Dr. Miner:

‘The medical division of the department of School
Hygiene has followed carefully the recommendations of the
recent survey report and the plans of our former Director
of School Hygiene, Dr. Walter F. Cobb.

‘A general weekly medical inspection has been made
during the past year by one full-time and one part-time physician, assisted by the school nurse. This work, consisting
of office consultations and class room inspection has been

, REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

done in an efficient manner. On each visit to school, after
having made the general aisle inspection in all the rooms,
ten or twelve pupils, on the average, are seen in the school
office for signs of contagious disease, distressing nose, throat,
eve or ear conditions, and for more thorough inspection than
can be given in the class room.

‘Problems relating to contagious diseases continue to
take good part of the time of our staff. The methods emploved in the management of these cases are those recommended by the special committee appointed by the State

' Association of Boards of Health few years ago. The procedure consists of rigid, daily inspection of pupils and the
disinfection of books, furniture, and so on. This means
many extra visits to schools. There have been no severe
epidemics during the past year. Occasionally we have found
community groups which have infected one another. When
conditions warrant it, in eases of diphtheria, cultures of all
children in class are taken. This has proved efficacious  

number of times, nine carriers having been detected in one
school where over one hundred and fifty cultures were
taken.

‘The vaccination laws have been rigidly enforced. Over
six hundred children have been vaccinated by the school
physicians at the request of parents. The vaccine is furnished us by the State Department of Health through the
local Board of Health.

‘‘ Physical examination of pupils in the grammar grades,
with the making out of life cards, has progressed satisfac
torily. Numerous defects have been found and parents have
been notified. Vocational and High School students doing
required work in gymnastics have been examined with spe
cial attention. ,

 “This department has been greatly strengthened during the past year by the appointment of school nurse, Miss
Bess E. Sullivan. She has taken up the work with enthus
iasm and has been very successful, especially in the ‘follow———tiéS

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
up’ work. special schedule has been outlined for visits
once week in districts where the need seems greatest. She
is on eall in all other schools, both public and parochial.
Plans for districts dispensaries are being made. During the
past term Miss Sullivan reports the discovery and care of
  cases of pediculosis, of impetigo contagioso, exelusions and home visits. The school nurse has given exeellent service to the school physicians in the vaccination
work.

‘‘During the past year children seeking working
certificates have been examined by our staff.’’

| The following are excerpts from report of Dr. Honoria 

K. Shine, physician for the girls of the High School and of
the upper grammar grades:

‘‘Three years ago when the system of physical examination for High School girls was established, found it diffieult to decide upon definite method of procedure, as Holyoke was the first city in this section of the state to organize
a department of School Hygiene. By observation of the
work in Physical Education for the girls at Smith, Mount
Holyoke and Columbia, and by information received from
the medical examiner for girls at the William Penn High
School in Philadelphia, working plan was finally evolved
and is in tangible form at present. ;

‘‘This year, more than any other, we realize the need of
conscientious supervision over the health of our High School
girls, both from patriotic and economic point of view. The
pupils, as well as the heads of families, feel the pressure
caused by the increased cost of living, and the majority of
the girls are trying to accomplish the utmost in order to be
better prepared to enter business or college life and thus
help economic conditions in their homes.

‘‘Some of the students for this reason attempt to pursue too strenuous course, and, by overwork in school or
out of school, they become overwrought and nervous, there  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

by defeating the ends they sought to obtain. This condition
I have corrected by advising the pupils to rearrange their
schedules and to adopt courses more in keeping with their
physical ability.

‘‘But it is not alone the ambitious student, find, who
needs advice. More often it is the shirker who spends too
much time at the moving picture theatre, neglecting both
studies and rest, and who appears in the class room with
the listless and indifferent manner so discouraging to the
teacher. These cases are investigated and oftentimes, am
glad to state, with satisfactory results.

“It is difficult at times to determine whether this indifference is due to lack of ambition or lack of proper nourishment. After few careful inquiries have been made, the
true condition is learned. In some cases the pupil admits
that she has voluntarily come to school without taking sufficient breakfast—the penalty of laziness. In other cases (fortunately small in number) the pupil comes to school hungry
because of conditions of want at home. The indolent ones
are urged to systematize their sleeping and waking hours
and thus find time to eat before coming to school. The
Dean kindly provides for those who cannot get sufficient
nourishment at home. This, of course, is done in tactful
manner without hurting the pride of the girls.

| ‘While untold good is derived from the general super- vision of the girls, the greatest benefit comes from the individual physical examination which give to each girl every
year. preliminary examination of the heart and lungs
only is made in the ninth grades, in order to ascertain
whether girl may or may not enter the physical training
class at High School. If she passes this test and continues
her education, she receives more detailed inspection at
the High School gymnasium. The second examination includes the eye, ear, nose and throat, teeth, heart, lungs,
spine, arches and skin. The normal pupil may begin her

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
physical training immediately, while those who are physically deficient receive added attention and special prescription in the form of advice and corrective exercises |
which are then made out for her individual needs. These
exercises are demonstrated by the Physical Director and the
pupil has ample opportunity and encouragement to perform
the exact corrective exercise which is required for her particular case. If girl is excluded from physical training
class for some defect which cannot be remedied by exer.cises, she is given card to indicate the nature of the complaint and is instructed to see her family doctor. After two
or three months she is again examined and, if her condition
allows, she may start gradually to perform the required
gymnasium work. In the case of the pupil who is normal
at the beginning of the vear but who seems to deteriorate
later on, second or third, and sometimes weekly examination, is made, and she either is excused from all work or
takes only those exercises which require slight exertion.

‘‘The follow-up work, which is done with the sophomores who are required to take Physical Training and with
the juniors and seniors, for whom gymnasium work is elective, is based upon the same working plan as the above. I
find that the results obtained from the examinations and
advice are most satisfactory. Not only are the pupils anxious to obtain perfect health, but their parents also are
giving thoughtful consideration and intelligent co-operation
in promoting the ideal of ‘Mens sana in corpore sano.’

‘“‘The following is the result of the medical inspec- |
tion and examination of the four hundred and thirty-nine
girls in the High School whom have examined during the
year  Faulty posture (round shoulders, scoliosis),  ;
poor eyes,  granulated lids,  sore ears,  deviated septum,  poor teeth,  diseased tonsils and adenoids,  ;
heart trouble,  tendency to tuberculosis,  low arches,
about per cent; anemia,  hyperthyroidism,  chronic
appendixes,  |

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

‘‘Nearly all the girls who have poor teeth are receiving treatment, and the same is true in cases of the other
defects mentioned.

‘‘Through the combined efforts of the Associated Charities and Miss Fay, found it possible to have one of the
pupils operated upon in the orthopedic clinic of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. This was most interesting case. Since infancy the pupil had only slight use
of the right arm. After the operation, which was followed
by Zander treatment, the patient found she had almost
normal use of the arm.

‘‘Another case of deformed ankle, which found on
examination to be the result of infantile paralysis, was successfully treated at Dr. McAusland’s clinic at the Holyoke
City Hospital.

‘One pupil also was operated on for deviated septum
and adenoids. The three cases were very successful and
the efficiency of the girls has been decidedly increased.

‘‘This is my third year as medical examiner of the girls
in the High School. Each year note growing desire on
the part of the girls to improve their physical condition.
The good-natured spirit in which they have received my
advice on personal matters leads me to urge very strongly
the necessity of instructing our girls in personal hygiene.

‘“The splendid co-operation which has been given me
In every possible way and the patience of the principal and
teachers of the High School have been source of inspiration and encouragement to me in this new work. While
Holyoke is pioneer in school hygiene work, feel sure
that there is no other city in the state which is doing more
to make safe the health of her future citizens.’’

This report of Mr. Louis K. Appel outlines the way in
which practical lessons in health and in physical education
are given to all children below the High School:

‘*The work in Physical Education has been conducted

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
along the same general lines as in the preceding year, and
progress has been noted in every phase.

‘‘Owing to the limited facilities, the gymnastic lesson
still occupies the most conspicuous place on the day’s order.
The lessons comprise the fundamental motor activities and
aim to produce the best physiological and hygienie effects in
the shortest time. They are graded according to their difficulty and are changed every two weeks. Emphasis is directed toward perfect execution, and the results have been

' most gratifying.

Folk dancing has now been established upon proper
basis. The dances are performed with vigor and enthusiasm. Victrola records have been purchased whenever feasible, and the dancing has been greatly improved.

‘“In athletics, advancement has been made in individual
and team conduct. ‘Play Fair and Respect Your Opponent’
has been the slogan. The baseball trophy was won by the.
Metealf School; the soccer banner by the Morgan School;
and the athletic meet by the Lawrence School. Despite the
various handicaps the athletic meet was great success.

 There were more entries than ever before and the events
were run off in shorter time. Much credit is due the members of the High School track team, who served as officials.
The splendid participation of the elementary schools was
very encouraging. The most potent force in securing better results in athletics has been the untiring efforts of Mr.
Thomas Finn, who se services as referee are most valuable.

“In the ‘Physical Efficiency Tests’ competition was
keen. Of the grammar schools, the Metcalf School had the
highest percentage, per cent, and the Lawrence
School followed closely with per cent. Of the elementary schools the South Chestnut Street School set up the
enviable record of per cent, followed by the Springdale School with per cent. It is planned to extend the
Physical Test, in the coming year, to the girls.

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

‘‘Classes for the pupils of grade nine have been conducted at the High School gymnasium on Saturday mornings. The attendance has been especially good, which indicates appreciation of the privilege on the part of the pupils.

‘‘The work of many of the elementary schools has been
taken over by Miss Ruth Yoerg. This makes it possible to
have the Supervisor visit the grammar schools semi-monthly
instead of monthly. This arrangement has proved very satisfactory.

‘‘The Supervisor is planning detailed Course of Study
for publication. This will be of material assistance to the
teachers.

‘‘Under the present system, where the grade teacher
conducts the work, much credit is due her for the commendable results that she obtains. To everyone who has contributed toward making Physical Education more real and
more effective, and who has proffered his co-operation, am

‘especially indebted.’’
The following report has been submitted by Miss Effie
Shambaugh, Director of Physical Education for Girls of the
High School. Miss Shambaugh has one of the most efficient
and successful departments in the entire school system:

‘“‘The plan of Physical Edueation for girls in the Holyoke High School may be outlined as follows:
I—Compulsory Training for High School Girls:

(a) Formal gymnastics during first and second
years which ineludes free hand calisthenics,
drills with hand apparatus, heavy apparatus,
daneing (folk and athletic) and games of low
organization. All work in formal gymnastics
Is graded as in academic courses.

(b) Swimming during first and seeond years,
which ineludes fundamental strokes and simple diving. Pupils are graded and must pass

a swimming test before receiving credit for

Physical examinations of High School girls taking any
form of Physical Training have been completed by Dr.
Shine. The age, height, posture, spine, arches, teeth, and
pulse before and after exercise are recorded, as well as a
brief statement of the student's health history. Restrictions and suggestions for individual eases are noted. Third
and fourth year girls are now being examined relative to the
condition of heart and lungs.

Individual eases of shoulders of uneven height, round
shoulders and slight curvatures of spine are receiving special attention. We are concentrating upon the elimination
of poor posture as the root of poor physical development.
Our suss depends upon the co-operation of the girls
while outside of the gymnasium as well as in it. Because of
the large number of girls possessing low arches, special exercises are now included in every gymnastic lesson, which
aim to strengthen muscles of the feet and ankles.

the High School librarian, and students are referred to articles on Physical Education and Hygiene. graded course of

will be submitted to the school department. The definite
course will serve as railroad track and, if the bed and rails
are laid straight. the train will get somewhere and on time.”’

Those who find this report interesting are urged to read
the survey report of  and Dr. Cobb’s report issued a
year ago. By no other means ean the real scope of the department of School Hygiene be understood or appreciated.

Respectfully submitted,

REPORT OF ATTENDANCE OFFICERS
To the School Board of Holyoke:

The report of the attendance officers for the school year,
which ended on June is herewith submitted. It is
the forty-third annual report of this department. |

The taking of the annual school census by the new
method of continuous registration was complete success.
It was taken quickly and with little expense, and produced
figures which are proof of its completeness.

Pleasant and co-operative relations continue between
this department and employers of child labor. There were
  certificates issued to individuals between fourteen
and sixteen years of age. These numbers practically correspond with those of last year. In view of the fact that for
the school year, which ended in June,  but certificates were issued to applicants, it is evident that our
schools are still being heavily drawn upon to supply needed

- labor.

From September to June twenty-seven
summonses were served for cases of truancy. Twenty-one
of these boys were probated and their cases continued from
time to time throughout the year. They were finally discharged. Six boys were committed to the Training School
in Springfield. At this time eleven boys from this city are
at the Hampden County Training Sehool.

From January to December this department issued educational certificates between the
ages of sixteen and twenty-one; also edueational eertifi  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
cates to illiterate minors of the same age limits. These, together with employment certificates issued, make  
total of certificates of all kinds issued during the
period. |
The attendance officers made night calls in connection with day school work, and ealls for the evening
schools.
, Prosecutions made during the year for violations of
school laws included the following:
Two motion picture theatre proprietors for inducing ,
children between the ages of seven and sixteen years to ab- :
sent themselves from school during the hours in which the |
public schools were in session: |
, Four illiterate minors for failure to attend evening |
school: |
Nine parents for neglect to provide for and send their )
children to school.
In these fifteen prosecutions conviction was secured in
each instance. There was total of forty-two cases of all
kinds before the court in this period.

Tn several reports the Superintendent reeommended to
the School Board that the  and  ’? plan of organization
in the public schools of Holyoke be carefully studied with
a view to reorganization on more modern hasis, and along

. lines whieh would make for improvement in education ag
| well as economy in time. |

Early in the School Board took action on this ree
ommendation and appointed the following Committee on
Reorganization: Rev. Franklin Knight, Joseph B. Weis, John
J.O’Connor. Dennis F. Lynch, Franeis MeSherry. This com:
mittee met on April and organized with Mr. Knight
as chairman and Mr. MeSherry as secretary. It was decided
to hold three conferenees in Holyoke with recognized authorities from other sehool systems; to visit certain reorganized school departments: and to hold at least one coD:
ference with the grammar school principals in Holyoke.

All of the information obtained either through visiting
schools or in other conferenees is included in the report of
conferences held in Holyoke with Dr. Alexander Inglis of
Harvard University, Dr. J. H. Van Sickle, Superintendent
of Schools in Springfield, and Mr. Joseph Ewart, Supervisor
of Junior High, Schools in Somerville. It seemed best to the

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
Committee to report its findings briefly rather than in complete detail. Consequently, the following report is an outline of the entire work and findings of the committee on reorganization :

“The first meeting of this Committee was held on Thursday
evening. April After general discussion of the present
organization and of the junior high school organization, it was voted
to arrange for series of evening conferences between certain experts on this subject and the members and representatives of the
Holyoke School Board, to which conferences the principals of the
grammar schools should be invited.

The first of these meetings was held on May with Professor
Alexander Inglis of Harvard University. He first treated the subject from the historical point of view. He then discussed the whole
problem broadly and thoroughly and made the following contentions:

That the present ninth grade is superfluous. and is found in
less than one per cent of the school systems of the United States:

That there is lack of proper articulation between the elementary schools and the high school:

That adjustment is most necessary at this point:

That much time is wasted in the grimmar grades in useless
review and in teaching subjects or parts of subjects of doubtful
Value:

That we face serious conditions of elimination and retardation
in the transition from lower to upper schools:  That the junior high school. that is, the plan, through
differentiated courses, flexibility, early provision for different capacities, gradual transition, promotion by subject. contentful subjects,
and other features, will remedy these evils, without increased cost,
without sacrifice of American principles in education, with nothing
to lose and everything to gain.

The second conference was held on May  when Dr. J. H. Van
Sickle of Springfield discussed the subject from the view point of a
Superintendent of schools. the junior high school system being already well under way in the Springfield school system which is under his direction. The main points of his treatment of the topic
were these:

That the ninth grade should he eliminated gradually, because |
the work can be done in eight years:

That the junior high school. that is, the plan, bridges the

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
gap between the elementary and high school in most effective way
from any view point:

That such reorganization has many advantages, for instance,
the one-teacher plan is replaced by departmental teaching:

That the plan effects economy of instruction and equipment:

That much subject matter of grades  and can be eliminated, and mental discipline obtained from more useful subjects in

' as great measure as from less useful subjects: :

That the plan will result in saving of money.

The third conference took place on May  at which time the
subject was treated by Mr. Joseph Ewart of Somerville, Mass., from
the standpoint of the principal of the junior high school. Some of
his statements follow:

The junior high school movement is the greatest modern
movement in education. Cities adopting it have everything to gain
and nothing to lose.

The Somerville plan consists in gradually changing over  and-  system to system. The pupils save year and get a
better education. The argument for mental discipline through the
present system supposes that the ‘theory of formal discipline’ is
true—which is not the case.

In grades one to six under the one-teacher plan obedience is
the watchword. In the junior high school responsibility is the
watchword.

There should be no such thing as nine grades below the high

. school.

Do not set up well defined courses of study in junior high
schools.

In the first year, sixty-five per cent of the time is enough for
regular work, fifteen per cent for shop work, and twenty per cent
for electives. There should be no final choices. ‘

The great evil to avoid is putting pupils into grooves through
selection. This was the only argument advanced against the junior
high school in the National Education Association in New York, in
July,  .

Somerville is on the  -and-  plan and is working towards the
  plan. Somerville plans to have ten elementary schools of
grades one to six, four junior high schools, grades seven, eight, and
nine, and one senior high school, grades ten, eleven and twelve.

Make promotions by required subjects, plus reasonable work in

— electives.

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  

The junior high school is an educational clearing house.

Adopt two session plan.

Be careful not to bring the high school work down into the
junior high school. On the contrary, build up the elementary school
-into the junior high school.

All courses of study should be conservatively made and the
opportunity for pupils to change courses with the least disturbance
to their run of work should be offered at all times.

Work out the whole plan slowly. Somerville developed one
junior high school in  one in  has one planned for September,  and will open its fourth and last one in  .

There seems to be no objection from practical experience to
the junior high school. .

The present elementary school system of eight or nine grades
has in it some of the best material for junior high school teachers.

The junior high school organization, particularly when it

: comes from  -and-  plan, should add no cost to the work of the
school system.

On June and  the Superintendent, with several members
of the School Board, personally visited the Forster Junior High
School at Somerville, and with Principal Ewart made somewhat
careful inspection of the work.

On June the School Board held conference with the principals of the five grammar schools of Holyoke, at which as at the
other conferences perfectly free discussion was encouraged.

As result of all these conferences and of their deliberation on
the subject, your Committee has reached the following conclusions:

That, inasmuch as the ninth grade in the grammar schools
appears to be little more than review year, to which are added
some subjects or parts of subjects that do not properly belong to
the elementary school curriculum at all, or belong to the more
specialized curriculum of the high school; and further, because
the ninth grade exists in less than one per cent of the school sys. tems of the country, indeed, is not found anywhere west of our own
Commonwealth, your Committee would recommend that the ninth
grade, as such, be eliminated from the Holyoke public school system as soon as practicable. Impressed by the wealth of sound arguments in favor of the junior high school idea from the view point of
psychology, of pedagogy, of increased interest on the part of the
pupils, by reason of better adjustment of the lines of education
offered therein to the needs of the individual pupil, thereby tending to insure his longer continuance in the schools, not to mention

  REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

. the view point of economy of time as well as of expense, particularly in the elimination of the ninth grade; impressed by all this,
your Committee would recommend that the junior high school idea,
as the basis of the plan, be established in the central district
during the school year  .

The Committee would further recommend that the Superintendent be requested to report to this Board at his early convenience
a tentative curriculum and arrangement for such centrally located
junior high school, with an outline of the various adjustments of
the present school arrangements rendered necessary by its introduction into the Holyoke public school] system.

July FRANCIS McSHERRY, Secretary.”

This report was received, approved and made part of
the records’ of the school board meeting of July .
Steps were taken immediately to make its provisions effective, but in conservative way. In September,  the Elm
Street School, the William Whiting School and the South
Chestnut Street School were established as the six-year
units, exclusive of kindergarten work. The Lawrence School
was established as the three-vear unit or junior high school
for the three schools mentioned above. Work was begun on
the reorganization of the courses of study for the first six
years and, at this writing, splendid progress has been made.
The studies of the first vear at the Lawrence School (formerly the seventh grade) were rearranged to meet the requirements of the first vear of Junior high school. Having been
tried for vear, these courses will serve as excellent material for other junior high schools to be organized at later
date. To provide for elimination at the top as well as reconstruction at the beginning, the special ninth grade was
eontinued at the Lawrenee School and special ninth grades
were organized at the Metealf and Highland Schools. Other
necessary adjustments were made, always with the absolute

REPORT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
requirement that any changes that were planned to assist in
reorganizing the system on basis from the  -and- 
plan should not re-act against the pupil.

 On February several important changes in work
went mto effect, all of which were preparatory to the organizing of junior high school work in constructive and
conservative way. In the five grammar schools the work in
the eighth and ninth vears was rearranged somewhat, and
departmentalized by subjects. Latin was introduced in the
middle of the eighth vear. For the eighth and ninth years
a daily program of seven forty minute periods was arranged.
On the whole, the progress made in the first half year of
reorganizing the local school system was most satisfactory.
The real test will come from this time to the end of the
present school vear.
Respectfully submitted,
FRANCIS McSHERRY.

PART II
REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES
To His Honor the Mayor, and the Citizens of Holyoke:

The Board of Trustees for Vocational Education in ,
this city respectfully submits the following, the fourth annual report.

As was anticipated, the attendance at vocational
schools generally suffered during the past year because of
the entry of the United States into the war. This fact contributed, as is well known, to the higher cost of living,
making it necessary in many instances for boys to go into

. gainful oecupations who would otherwise have been stu- .
dents in the schools in question. Also, the growing seare-  |
ity of labor, due to the transfer of large numbers of men
from the ranks of industry to those of the various branches )
of army and navy service, inevitably raised the wages of
labor to point very attractive to those who could avail
themselves of them, increased the amount of meht work
called for, and so particularly struek at the attendance of
students at vocational schools. This is at once testimony
to their usefulness as recruiting agencies for the mechanical arts, and revelation of their vulnerability at such
times as these.

Nevertheless, the Holyoke school was not as badly
affected by these conditions as some others, as the figures ,
show that the enrolments of both day and evening schools
suffered decrease of only about twelve per cent. To offset this decrease, the attendance of the women at the evening classes in the practical arts classes increased by somewhat more than twelve per cent, in figures, from to  .

  REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL

In the direction of efficieney and larger output it was
thought best to change the school hours so that they are
now, morning, to  and afternoon, to  ,
thus making week of thirty-five hours instead of week
of thirty-two hours and one-half as formerly.

THE FACULTY

The faculty remains the same as in the previous year
with the exeeption of the directorship, whieh is now filled
by Mr. Russell B. Leonard, and the replacement of Mr.
Alden T. Stubbs (resigned) by Mr. George S. Carter in the
Patternmaking Department, both of whom are making good
at their respective posts.

It has been found more eonvenient to appoint. the
evening school teachers at the previous May meeting of
the Board, so that they may be more ready and prepared
to take up their work promptly and intelligently wher.
the evening elasses begin in October. ITnereased attention

. is also being given to the professional improvement of the —
teaching staff of both day and evening sehools.
THE REVISED SALARY SCHEDULE

Inasmuch as the question of salary increases has proved
to be one that is constantly arising as well as vexing one
at times, the Board of Trustees last November thought it
well to order revision of the rule regarding salaries so as
to establish  as the initial salary of heads of departments, and  as that of the assistants therein, increasing these by the automatic annual increases of  until
at the beginning of the fifth vear of service they reach a

 maximum of  and  respectively. It is hoped that
this schedule will settle the matter of salary increases for
the present, and prove satisfactory to all parties involved.

REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL  
NEW EQUIPMENT

Through the kindness of Mr. Robert E. Neweomb and
at the suggestion of the Chairman of the Vocational Trustees, Mr. Wills M. Fleming, the school has received from —
the Deane Steam Pump Company set of standard tools.
There has also come to the school set of heddles from the
Howard Brothers’ Manufacturing Company of Worcester.

The sehool has added by purchase to its equipment a
Gem, Draper and two hand looms for the evening class in
loom fixing. This has proved valuable course to the elass
of men who have shown their mterest by their very regular attendance. For the machine shop there has been purchased an Economy ineh quick-change gear lathe; for
the printing shop  worth of new type and other equipment, mostly replacements, and foot-power Portland multiple punehing machine. Various reference books for the
library, including New International Cyelopedia of
twenty-four volumes, have been purchased.

SPECIAL WAR WORK

The United States Government recently requested the
vocational schools of the country to arrange, if possible,
elasses in their evening schools for buzzer practice as a
means of preparation of the students in the elements of
radio telegraphy. Such classes were promptly organized
in the Holyoke school and have been quite well attended.

In the fall of Mr. Frank L. Eideman, Superintendent of the Cowan Truck Company, offered his services
to the school as volunteer instructor in the construction.
maintenance and repair of gasoline engines, with special
references to ignition systems including carburetors. This
is in preparation specially of men desiring to fit themselves
for service in connection with motor propelled machines
used in warfare. As yet there has not been sufficient
number of applicants for such instruction to warrant the .

  REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL
formation of such class. But, thanks to Mr. Eideman’s
offer, the school stands ready to furnish such instruction
when the demand for it arises.

' THE HOUSE BUILDING PROJECT

Because of the slackened attendance at the school in
the Carpentry Department this work has gone on rather
slowly, but already the exterior of the house is  practieally complete, the inside trim is largely in place, the doors
are ready to be hung and the floors to be laid. There remain to be completed certain hall panel work, arches and

the stairs. The plumbing and lighting fixtures are ready
to be installed, and there is fair chance that the house
may be completed by June if all goes well.
EVENING PRACTICAL ART CLASSES FOR WOMEN

These have been particularly opportune and well attended during the past year. To meet the demands of the
times, the Cooking Department has had unit courses in
wheatless breakfasts, meat substitutes, conservation and
substitution, elimination of waste, ete. special feature
this year was the extension work, carried on during the
summer months in the school buildings of the city, in canning and dehydrating of fruits and vegetables. An exhibit of this work was taken to the Eastern States Exposition and also shown at the Convention of the Parent Teacher
Associations in the High School.

Classes in sewing and knitting were also formed early
in September for war relief work in connection with the
Red Cross. Garments were made, and such an interest was
taken in the knitting class that members have continued to
knit sweaters, socks, wristers, ete., and to deliver them
through the school to the Red Cross.

To comply with request from the Polish residents
who wished to fit out their own people at the Polish reREPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL  
cruiting station, fourteen Polish girls, who knew how to
knit, came to the school for instruction in making the various garments, and they taught other units of fourteen at

F the Polish hall, thus bringing the instruction to large
number of people in that district.

There has been more interest than ever in the home
nursing classes and suggestion for another year to give
added interest would be to have course of lectures given
to the classes by doctors of the city.

Looking to the future, to make the Practical Arts Department available to larger number of women of the
city, plan should be formulated whereby building or
rooms could be secured in another section of the erty for
‘a practice house where additional classes could be held.
The courses in cooking, sewing, and home nursing would
then be available to many mothers who need such instruc tion and who cannot now go to the school on account of
the distance; and the girls could be taught the furnishing
and care of the home, and the varied arts of housewifery.

| ACCIDENT LIABILITY

In asmuch as the city of Holyoke, represented by the
Board of Vocational Trustees, might become liable for
death or injury caused by accidents in connection with the 
use of school machinery by the teachers or students, the
Board has thought it expedient to insure themselves, and
thus the city, against such liability by duly contracting
for the proper insurance.

EXHIBITS

Previously in this report mention is made of the exhibit of canned fruits and vegetables prepared under the
supervision of the school for the Eastern States Exposition, and later displayed at the convention of the Parent
Teacher Associations. Last May there was also arranged
for the general school exhibit of the Holyoke public schools’
in the City Hall, very considerable and interesting ex

  REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL
hibit of the work of the Vocational School. This was
visited during the three days it lasted by nearly half the
population of Holyoke.
| GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

In May last the Smith-Hughes bill, granting federal aid

to vocational schools, became law. If its terms are carried out as provided for, the Holyoke Voeational School
will receive for its work this vear  from this source.
This aid will increase in sucding years.

Although this is not an opportune time to push the
matter, it is well to bear constantly in mind that not only
the City of Holyoke under contractual agreement with the
State Board of Education to ereet at the earliest feasible
date building for the exclusive use of the Vocational
School, but also that no annual report of the trustees
should go forth without an insistent reminder to the citizens of Holvoke that the school cannot do its work efficientlv until building especially designed to meet its requirements is built to house it. While such building is awaited,
there are great inconveniences and deficiencies that must be
eontinuously endured by the faculty and students. At the
Same time, we realize that if we waited for such buildiing
we would have had no Vocational School since  .

It would be well to provide as soon as possible that the
evening classes in steam engineering may have the advantage of being able to study engines turning over as
well as motionless. The installation of small boiler
would make this possible. The carpenter shop also would
be much improved by the addition of several modest pieces
of woodworking machinery.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY AND THE DIRECTOR
To the Board of Trustees for Vocational Education:
The Secretary and the Director herewith submit their
fourth annual report. This part has been prepared by the
' latter, and. together with the rest of this volume, edited
‘and arranged by the former.
THE MACHINE DEPARTMENT
This department is the largest in the school, and due
to its complete equipment, is well adapted to be the popular department in these times when machinists are in such

The shop has the usual equipment of small tools necessary to perform its work.

The primary purpose of the work in the department
of Machine Shop Practice is to meet the needs of boys who
desire to follow the machine trades as life occupation.
The school does not aim to turn out skilled machinists. This

| can only be accomplished by long experience in the trade
itself. By offering systematic instruction in shop practice,
the school does develop some degree of skill in the man- ,
ipulation of machine tools, and knowledge of various
processes of manufacture. By means of related subjects—
Drawing, Mathematics, and Trade English—the student is
made familiar with their practical application. To the student who is regular in attendance, who gives earnest attention to his work, who is willing to cooperate with his in;
| REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL
structors, the course lays good foundation for the work |
of an intelligent and highly skilled machinist.
During the course the student is trained in actual productive work, varying according to the individual ability
of the student. The practical nature of the work calls for
a large amount of individual instruction, and all work is
assigned to the student in the form of job, from simple ;
problem involving few operations to more complicated
order calling for some knowledge of details, and some abilitv to assemble parts involving number of operations.

The actual shop practice of the first phase involves
bench work, and the use of such machine tools as the lathe,
drill, shaper and small plain miller.

The second phase calls for more advanced machine ,
work and practice in operating machine tools such as the .
Universal Milling Machine and the Universal Grinder, while
fitting and assembling form an important part of the work
of this period.

The third and fourth phases eall for tool making and .
involve such processes as hardening, tempering and the :
grinding of milling cutters, taps, reamers, arbors and countebores. )

The atmosphere of the commercial shop prevails .
throuchout the entire course and practical talks are given |
on the metallurgy of iron and steel, eutting angles, rakes. |
clearances. vibrations and deflections of tools for different }
metals. )

At various times commercial work has been taken in
from the loeal shops. This is not done with any intention
of exploiting the boy, but to furnish him with typical ma- :
terials and problems that arise in our local shops, and that
will probably confront him when ready for employment. :
Some of the firms for whieh work has been done are:

Walsh's Holyoke Steam Boiler Works

Holvoke Braiding Co.

  REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL

Deane Works of the Worthington Pump and Machinery Corporation

Springfield Blanket Co.

The ability to read and make drawings is an important
factor in the advancement or promotion of young man
in the mechanical trades. convincing testimony to this
is the number of men attending evening classes in drawing.
It is clear that they lack something vitally essential to
progress in their daily work. This year definite plans are
under way whereby the drawing work of the department
will be taught on more systematic basis, under condi, tions as near like those in commercial drafting room as
possible. This will undoubtedly be an improvement over
the method used last year. Calls often come for our students who are qualified to do drafting. This new drawing
course will give boy instruction in drafting room methods
and practices which, if he should desire to accept drafting position, would enable him to do so.

In the course, class and individual instruction is given.
The work is so arranged that the student is taken through
the various steps of sketching, lettering, blue print reading, inking, racing, and making of detail and complete —
working drawings, that are used by the students in the
shop.

Special effort is being made to treat trade mathematics in clear and concise way, carefully avoiding all
unnecessary matter, and presenting it to the student in a
concrete form on the shop floor as well as in the class room.

. The practical man appreciates the fact for himself that
mathematics is powerful tool that he should be able to
use in his work. The insruction presents only the vocaa tional phase of the subject which is essential to machine
' shop practice, and is planned to lay as broad foundation
as iS consistent with the scope of the work.

. The instruction in trade science is to train the judgREPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL  
ment rather than the memory of what books say about
things and to conserve the spirit of curiosity in the boy.
This is the first step in what is often called industrial intelligence by the shop man. The instruction in this subject will correctly emphasize the value of lubrication, properties of metals, screw threads and heat treatment of steel.
Due to the large number of boys per instructor in this
department, it has not been possible to further develop this
important branch of machine work. No one text book applies; the work presented demands great deal of study
and work on the part of the instructor.

An employer in selecting one of his employees for a
position as salesman and demonstrator, is often influenced
by the candidate’s ability to use good English. Special attention is called to the fact that in connection with the regular text books employed, we have introduced the practice of using trade journals and catalogs. The information given in these has in some respects great advantage
over the regular texts: For example, the details of mechanisms are often shown and explained little more fully than
is commonly done in the text, in order that user may more
readily grasp the features of construction and operation,
while more attention is paid to designating all parts by
the name commonly employed in the industry. The comments apply not only to the machine tool catalogs, but also
to those covering other lines of machinery and materials,
as well as general hardware, boiler and pipe fittings.

This department has cooperated with the High School
Manual Training work by making arrangements for the instruction of High School students in Machine Shop Work
once week. This class has been conducted since Nov.  ,
 and the members, though only few, have shown
their interest by the constant attendance. The State Board
of Education are not allowed to stand any expense in the

local communities, so it was necessary for small tuition

rate, based upon the pupil hour, to be charged the School .
Department.
The evening work is designed for the man who is
working during the day at this or an allied trade, but who
wants the opportunity to fit himself for better position
or to familiarize himself with some process that is giving
him trouble. In order to best meet the needs of every one
the work is laid out in the following units:
Making Fits ,
Serew Cutting
Lathe Work }
Milling Machine Work ,
Universal Grinding
- Blue Print Reading ;
Shop Mathematics
Jig and Tool Design. ,
This enables man at any time to select any unit that .
he may particularly desire at that time. Some men leave’. ,
after finishing their units, while others stay throughout
the season taking other units, and thus making themselves .
better mechanics.
THE CARPENTRY DEPARTMENT :
This department does not confine itself to shop .
feet by feet in the school building, but has part of its
instruction and practice on an eight room house that it

The shop is well equipped with the usual hand tools
and individual benches.

Primarily, the main purpose of this department is to
train its students for the trade of House Carpenters. While |
this is essentially true, sight should not be lost of the fact
that there is good opportunity for the boy who does not
desire this particular branch of the woodworking trade,
but who would prefer to specialize along the line of Cabinet Making. The equipment of the shop, the making of
inside finish for the house now under construction, and the
many cabinet jobs continually going through the shop, all
give training upon work not generally required by the ordinary house carpenter, but by the inside man. If the student shows special qualifications for one branch or asks for
instruction along special lines, it is the policy of the department men to co-operate to do this so far as they can
, and it seems wise. In spite of the fact that very little
building is being done, both skilled carpenters and cabinet makers are in urgent demand by the Government. No
boy deciding to follow either branch need fear about there
ever being demand for his labor, provided he is well
versed in his trade. As has often been said, there is always
a position for the man who is more capable than his fellow
workman. The main demand, however, has been for house
carpenters, hence this report features on that branch of

the trade.

this department was doing toward training house carpentry

the fall when started, it was found necessary to abandon
the project until better weather prevailed. During the
severe weather the students were iustructed in the shop
on work connected with the house, such as sash, door and
window frames, ete. When the weather became such that
the boys were able to start operations on the house again,
the work went along satisfactorily, and by the end of the
school term of  the house was ready for lath and
plaster. During the summer vacation the lathing and .
plastering was completed. When school reopened in September, the boys went about the task of completing the  |
exterior work, also fitting and hanging the sashes, and by
the time cold weather arrived the house was closed in and
ready for the interior trim.

The work of finishing the interior is giving the boys
excellent training, and with that which they are getting
in the school shop, will prove to be of material advantage
when they seek employment with commercial concerns.

The principal branches the boys are being trained to .
do is Roof Framing, Stair-building. Making and Hanging
of Doors, Sashes and Frames, Pantry Fixtures, Panel Work,
Cireular Work, Window Seats, Cabinets, ete. It would
seem that with the related studies that are taught in conjunction with the shop practice, the boys ought to become
good mechanics. .

The building of an actual house furnishes many good
features for the training of the bovs in carpentry work.
The experience in staking out cellar and the erection of
the guide boards gives type of work that cannot be as
forceably taught in the shop as on the job. This gave the
boys an opportunity to apply some trade mathematics in |
squaring the guide lines and finding the heights, levels and
measurements of the walls.

Two of the most important undertakings in connection
with house are the stairs and roof. The stairs in the

house offer some good practical work. There are the cellar, main and attic stairs. In each case the height between .
floors is not the same and the construction is all different,
although the general principles are the same. These stairs
gave the boys some excellent problems in trade mathematics, figuring out the height of riser and width of tread
for the different stairways and how to apply the steel
square or pitch board in laying out the rough stringers.
The boys should have some idea of the proportions of the |
tread and riser and how they are obtained.

The roof of this particular house although not complicated, offers some good practical work. The main roof,
is gabled with dormers, front and back, the back porch
being hipped. These different roofs offer good foundation for the boys to acquire knowledge of roof framing.

Trade mathematics enters largely in roof construction
finding the length and cuts for the various rafters, finding
the areas of roof surfaces, figuring the required number 
of shingles for different spacing made necessary through
having different pitches. The steel square is great factor
.in this particular class of work and the boys get great
deal of practice with this tool when laying out the work.
After becoming familiar with the use of it, they are
able to figure the work out with better results than any
other method. Consider finding the length of rafters, how
difficult it is to most boys to figure the length of common
rafter when they do not know the principle of the right
triangle, but with the application of the steel square, the ,
boys are able to solve these problems without much diffculty. Teaching trade mathematics is quite difficult problem, nevertheless, but it is essential that the boys should
at least have fair knowledge of this subject and how to
apply it. From the beginning of this project, the boys
have been given problems on the immediate work they
had in hand, and they are numerous in the construction

of house, such as the allowance for the rough opening
of window over glass size, door openings, laying out partitions, ete.

There are some valuable points worth mentioning in the
building of house, which could not be gained so effectively
through any other source. The boys are better able to understand why the floors are crowned, the Joists and studding
spaced  -inch on centers, what to do to avoid plaster cracks,
why some of the partitions are trussed and other points too
numerous to mention here.

Building house usually involves representations of
most of the building trade crafts in completing it which
must be an additional advantage to the boys as they have
the opportunity in observing the different ways these
mechanics accomplish their work, and why the carpenter
adopts certain methods in arranging his work for the accommodation of other trades.

In order to successfully carry out this plan it was de) cided to divide the students into two groups, each group
alternating semi-weekly between the shop and the house.
With this arrangement the boys are able to keep up with the
class room studies and also get certain amount of shop
work. This gives the boys chance to get an all around
training and has tendency to keep the boys interested with
having this variety and not being kept at any particular job
for any great length of time. Furthermore, if the boys are
not kept in close touch with the work, such as being away
from the job for the period of week or more, they are apt

to miss something which would be of value to them.

DESCRIPTION OF VOCATIONAL SCHOOL HOUSE.

The house as planned is of the cottage type for one
family. There are eight rooms conveniently and compactly
arranged. The layout or plan is exceptionally good. With
a reasonable amount of hall space, all parts of the house
are readily accessible. .

  REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL

The relation of the kitchen to the dining room and
reception hall is matter of much importance to the housewife. The reception room is rather large and leads directly
to the living room on the left and to the second floor on the
right by means of broad stairs with two landings. Easy
access to the kitchen and lavatory from the reception hall
is had by means of short hall at the rear.

The living room is spacious for house of this kind.
This room is really the most important from the social point
of view of the family. It is domestic in character with the
open fire place at one end and bookcases at the opposite
end. The living room opens directly into the dining room.

 French doors open from this room to the broad front veranda which stretches along the entire front of the house.
The effect of the French doors is to increase the apparent
size of the rooms when viewed from the outside. The coat
closets on either side of the front entrance are lighted and
afford ample space for umbrellas and heavy wrappings.

The pantry is economically placed between the dining
room and the kitchen. The kitchen has southwest exposure and is protected by the lobby and porch on the south.
Provision is made to reach the cellar from the kitchen by
means of the short hallway and also from the  outside
through the bulkhead on the south. )

On the second floor the bedrooms are all corner rooms
thus allowing ample air circulation in the warm months.
Between the two front chambers is sewing room lighted by
a large bay window, while the linen storage is arranged to
open on the hall, thus being convenient of access from all
chambers. Closet space, usually so hard to find in houses
of moderate cost,  available for all chambers.

The northeast chamber is provided with an open fireplace.

The unfimshed attie will be provided with plumbing and
hehting layouts.

THE HOUSE BUILT BY THE STUDENTS OF THE HOLYOKE |
VOCATIONAL SCHOOL

  REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL

The estimated cost of this house figured about two years
ago was Since then, as every one is aware, prices
of all building materials have in many cases advanced practically double those used in the first estimate. The total
amount spent for the house ending December,  is
$ There are still quite number of outstanding
bills not paid besides material not yet bought which will
make the approximate cost of the house as .

, As the house nears completion, the question has arisen
several times: How is it proposed to dispose of the product?
Three methods are available, namely:

 —It can be sold to the highest bidder.

 —It can be retained by the city for its income value.

 —It might be disposed of under the Homestead Act of
Massachusetts.

A few parties have asked to look over the house with

the view of purchasing it, so there is apparently little doubt

, that the city can be readily reimbursed for the moiey now
expended should it see fit to do so. While the question of
reimbursement is important, sight should not ove lost of the
fact that this project was not started with the intention of
competing with the loca contractors, nor with the thought
of making good finane.al investment for the eity, but
primarily as means of properly educating the boys taking
the course in House Carpentry at the School.

This house has no finished rooms in the attic, nor any
garage on the premises. Should the Board of Trustees feel
like holding this property little longer, the building of @
garage would furnish more good training for our new boys
who were not in the school when this project was begun. It
might be arranged with the prospective owner to have the
attic finished by the students. These are recommendations
that ean be considered in the future.

The evening class connected with this department aims

to increase the trade knowledge of apprentices, journeymen

REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL  
and general woodworkers. The work that is outlined below
and which is divided into units, enables the men to select
one that might best meet their needs. On the other hand,
they are at liberty to take the whole if they so desire. With
extra knowledge of the trade at their command they will be
of more value to themselves and their employers.

Roof framing, including drawing and estimating.

Stair building, including drawing and estimating.

Cabinet making and joinery.

Estimating and plan reading for mill men.

To give the right kind of instruction it  necessary to
have machines more suitable for the work than some that
are at the present in the department’s possession. What is
needed are machines of the variety found in the various .
woodworking plants and which the boys should be able to
operate. The boys who enter the shops will then be in a
position to handle the machines skilfully. This will give
them more confidence in knowing that they are capable of
doing this work, and also is an excellent means of procuring position.

At present in the department there is the dovetail and
resawing attachments together with the boring machine
which are of little use to school shop. chain mortiser
and small moulding machines are needed much more in this
department. If the machines not needed could be exchanged in part payment for those needed, the department '
would be much better equipped to perform its task.

THE PATTERN MAKING DEPARTMENT.

The Pattern Shop, while confined to smaller room
than the other shops in the school, is well equipped to meet
the needs of this locality in training workers for this trade.
The department has the following equipment:

One Oliver Bench Planer,  -inch with H. P. Westinghouse Motor.

  students, besides the miscellaneous small tools needed
by all.

The aim of the course in Pattern Making, is to teach the
use of all hand tools and woodworking machines, in the
construction of single and mutiple part patterns, of built
up patterns, sweep work, and of core boxes, with as much
foundry practice as possible. It is an understood fact today,
to be an expert in the pattern making trade, one must have
a thorough understanding of foundry work as connected
with the trade. In the second and third phases much time
is spent on foundry work.

The Carpentry Department has built some moulding
benches which, coupled with the flasks now under construction in the Pattern Department, will go into the foundry
room in the High School Basement. Complete equipment
for this room has been ordered and it is expected that the
Pattern Department will have it for their use within few
weeks. The purpose is not to make moulders as well as
pattern makers, but to give the student as much foundry
instruction as time will permit, in order to make him more
efficient at his trade.

Mechanical drafting and laying out patterns is one of
the essentials of good pattern maker. The student is instructed to make his own working drawing, to read and
interpret with confidence the blue prints of machine parts
and in all drawing and sketching that is essential for a
skilled pattern maker. Much time is given over in laying
out and drawing the pattern to be constructed. The first
phase drawing is given over to shop sketching, reading blue

prints and the use of drawing instruments. The remaining
three phases are given over to the more difficult and complicated drawings, and making of tracings and blue prints.

The Pattern Making trade is one that requires an unusual amount of skill and accuracy, Judgment and appreciation of proportions, as he is the first person to give definite form to the new design of machinery. He has to put
in to form, what the draftsman has put on the paper. First
he must make mental picture of the finished pattern, and
the most practical way for making the pattern in the foundry, then make sure the finished parts of the casting are in
the Drag so as to insure the best iron for all finished parts,
and last to take into consideration the machining of the
casting. This trade is one that involves working knowledge of Drafting, Laying out of Patterns, Pattern Making,
Foundry Work, and Machine Shop Practice coupled together with practical mathematics.

The Pattern Making trade of today is of great importance to modern industry, and is one in which there is certainty of excellent wages, and offers especially attractive
opportunities and opens many avenues to promotions.

An expert pattern maker can with very little study and
practice, become an inside finisher in house building, also
a finished Cabinet Maker and demand good wages at either.

During the year this department has made some very
difficult and complicated patterns for the  Extra Heavy
Reed Lathe which the school is at the present time building. Patterns have also been made to replace broken machine parts for both Day and Evening Vocational Schools,
with some very difficult patterns for the Westfield Vocational School. Very little, if any, preliminary exercises are
given the boys. Practically every boy starts making patterns for the school’s use and commercial work as soon as
he enters. Every job given the boy has some commercial
value, in that each boy realizes he is making pattern to
be used in the shop and not merely an exercise.

| REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL

Our Pattern Room is very well lighted. Our equipment
is very good excepting band saw which is one of the essentials of the best equipped shops. That is the one machine used most in our department and the machine we
want most.

a THE PRINTING DEPARTMENT

The printing department offers the opportunity for a
boy to learn the rudiments of well-paying trade. It requires fair degree of education, good physical health, and
for the job compositor, an artistic sense of proportion, balanee, harmony and contrast.

The Holyoke Voeational School, as the following equipment will show, is in position to give working knowledge of practically all processes and operations that the
industry ealls for.

  Style  -B Colt’s Armory Press, complete with
brake

past year, the greater part being ‘replacement of type and
material that had been worn out, or efficiency demanded |
its discard. small knife card cutter, and foot power
Portland Multiple Punching Machine have been the addi- ,
tions to the machinery. Safety devices for three of the five |
presses have been added, thus insuring against accident. ,
While this department has not the largest nor the
most modern equipment, it has frequently been praised for
being well equipped to fulfil its purpose. One change that
would make it meet the needs of the community better
would be the exchanging of the Pearl presses for small
eylinder press.
A large amount of instruction and productive work
has been done, many novelties being worked up during the
year. Work with selling value of  has been ex ecuted, much of it up-to-date advertising matter for the
school. Such jobs as the printing of school calendar, various types of programs used by the Parent-teachers’ Associations, various forms of filing and record ecards used by
the schools, and several placards.
A scientifie course of study has been compiled for the
department that has received the commendation of Dr. F.
W. Hamilton, Nationa) Apprentice Director of the United
Typothetae, and Bert G. Brady, Chairman of the Committee on Apprentices of the International Typographical
Union. Constant progress is being made in methods, and
due attention is paid to the work of other instructors and
the industry.
The greatest handicap of the department is the lack of
boys who will stay long enough for the course to be of the
fullest amount of benefit to themselves and to the industry. For example, practically none of the boys returned
at the opening of the new school year in September, and
since then fifteen boys have enrolled. At present, ten are
left, all Phase except one. As this is fifty per cent larger

REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL  
than last year, it gives evidence that the department  
filling some small part as training school for the industry.

One could wish for more active cooperation and constructive criticism from the industry. The evening extension work has proven the need of such help. In view of
the intense interest both of the Typothetae and Typographi- )
eal Union in the education of the apprentice with the view
of making more efficient and better trained journeyman,
it would seem that there should be more attendance in the
evening school. The school wants to be of the greatest
help and benefit to this industry of Holyoke. If it is to attain its fullest value as training school, it must have this
cooperation. :

Evening classes are conducted for compositors and
pressmen, giving them such assistance as will be helpful for
the better performance of their daily work. The work is
planned in the following units:

Composition :

Book Composition
Job Composition
) Advanced Job Composition. :
Press Work:
Press Construction
Press Feeding
Press Work
Advanced Press Work.
The policy of the department is to meet the needs of
- the employee along any line from which he can obtain the
greatest benefit.

In order to meet conditions that are bound to be imposed upon us in the future, the following suggestions are 
offered by the head of the Department:

From survey of the Printing Industry in Holyoke

satisfactory to have this work connected with the department from which boy comes. This does not prove an

easy task when the boys from four departments are group| ed together as it is necessary to do with one instructor.

The Department has worked steadily toward the arrangement of definite standards of minimum attainments
for promotion and graduation. To appreciate the difficulty
of this task it is necessary to remember that practically
any youth or young man between the ages of and  
may enroll here and can do so at any time during the
school year. |

Great differences in age, experience, maturity, capacity and scholarship of our entrants is the result and the
situation is further complicated by differing dates of entrance, and the widely divergent interests of our four shops.

The State law controlling our entrants says that any
boy of years who can profit from the instruction that
he is to receive, is eligible for admission. Some schools have

taken advantage of this wording and have decided that no
| boy under the sixth grade has had enough schooling for
him to profit by the instruction he is to receive, so could
not be admitted. These same schools advocate that all entrants be grammar school or eighth grade graduate for
it has been evident that such boys progress much more satisfactorily than others with less training. Since these schools
are judged to large extent by the boys who follow the
trades for which they were trained, it seems reasonable

for us to take similar stand on admission requirements.

A very badly needed school library has been started
and the appended list shows the character of the books selected. Though the number of volumes is not very impressive the written work turned in by the pupils already shows
the effect of having at hand the book you need when you
need it.

To qualify for diploma the students must have six
months’ experience in the trade, this counting as the last
half year of their course. Eight boys fulfilled these reREPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL  
quirements and were ready for their diplomas last fall
These being the first group of students to be ready for di- |
plomas the faculty thought it advisable to wait until next
June when there would probably be more students ready
and then have exercises similar to those held in other
schools. Besides these, there are several former students
who are entitled to certificates that can be awarded at the
same time as are the diplomas.

THE STEAM ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT |

During the past year there has been an evening class
for the firemen and one for the engineers each week. While
the enrolment this fall has been very small, the attendance
has generally been good.

Typewritten questions, answers and other notes are
now being given the members of these classes. which make
the work easier to follow and gives the student something
he can take home, study and keep for future reference. In
this way the instructor is helping his students to build up
a brief note or text book that will be of great value when
the holder is studying for his licenses.

The success of these classes can be readily ascertained
by the number of its members who secure higher grade
licenses. There seems to be the feeling on the part of some
that man must try for license several times before securing it, no matter from whence he came. This school
should be able to be as successful as some in Massachusetts where their pupils generally secure their licenses upon
their first examination, and where reputation with the examiners counts.

Out of all the engineers and firemen employed in Holyoke’s industries, there are surely enough to support these
classes better.

In order to make the work more successful and  interesting, provision should be made to have some equip  REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL
‘ment that can be operated. The recommendation in the
last report which called for small power plant cannot be
overestimated if the real success of this class is considered.
The following equipment is now on hand.

During the coming year it is planned to secure more
apparatus which, together with the notes and follow up
system, will make the classes larger.
THE ELECTRICAL DEPARTMENT
During the year, an evening class has been conducted
for electricians who were interested. The work is divided
into the following units:
Magnetism and its application.
Direct current motors.
Alternating current motors.
Transformers.
Starting devices and circuit breakers.
Measuring instruments.
Motor trouble.

REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL  

This school has aecess to the High School science apparatus, so that demonstrations can be given as needed.

THE TEXTILE DEPARTMENT

During the winter class in loom fixing and one in
design have been conducted, each two evenings week,
for the men who were working in textile mills days. While
the enrollment this season has been small, the members have
been so constant in their attendance that they must be re- 
ceiving help.

During the past the Gem, Draper and two hand looms
have been added to the equipment which together with the
other necessary small items, provides an outfit with which
the school is much better fitted to meet the needs of her students. The equipment now consists of the following machines: |

  Whitin Cotton Looms .

  Stafford Silk Looms

  Knowles Gem Loom (Dress Goods)

  Draper Antomatie Loom

  Beaming Frames

  Dressing Frame

  Hand Looms, Philadelphia Type.

The design courses are not planned to teach designers,
but to make more efficient loom fixers. men who understand
the relation of one department of mill to another and who
will be more valuable employees. The eourse followed has
been that outlined in last vear’s report.

RADIO AND BUZZER OPERATOR CLASS

REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL  
Buzzer operators for army work. The Federal Board of
- Education had arranged with army officers for training
men for this branch of the service. It was planned to have
this training done by the Vocational Schools throughout the
country, so Holyoke laid her plans for starting such class
and thus doing her bit for her country. The first night
the class met was November  th with an enrollment of
seventeen men and the class since this date has been in session four nights week during the school term. Due to her
prompt organization of this class, Holyoke was one of the
first cities to undertake this work.

This class is for conscripted men who are physically
qualified for army service and who will be called during
the second and sucding drafts. Several men not regis- —
tered in Holyoke were admitted to this class inasmuch as
they were now living here or there were no classes in their
locality. Several men registered at the beginning but were
called for service before the class was really under way. A
few have enlisted and later reported that the instruction received had been benefit to them. Most of the present numbers are young men physically fit belonging to Class (under the new draft ruling).

The purpose of this course is to teach the men the International or Continental Code (not the Morse), and drill
them until they can send and receive twenty words of five
letters each per minute. It is estimated that it will take
the average person with no knowledge of the work about
two hundred hours to reach this degree of proficiency. If
anyone is interested enough to purchase simple inexpensive buzzer outfit, the time spent at the school can be
greatly lessened by practice at home.

When the men can reach the required standard they
are given certificate which they are to give to their commanding officers upon reaching their cantonments, while
the school sends duplicate record to the Federal Board

  REPORT OF THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL
of Education who in turn give one to the proper army
officials.

The salary for such work begins at  per month
and if the individual is interested enough to continue his
study at camp he will be advanced into the Signal Corps

, where the salaries range as high as  per month. This
class is starting the men upon type of work that will lead
to the positions of non-commissioned officers.

On December lst there were twenty-six men enrolled
in this class. Indications point to more being enrolled
during the coming year. Holyoke has, as limit, fifty
men who can be trained for this work. This class is open
to new members at any time until the desired number are
trained. It is planned to continue this class four evenings
a week until July Ist.

THE EVENING PRACTICAL ARTS CLASSES FOR
WOMEN |

This is one of the most important branches of the Vo: cational School. The classes are well organized along
definite lines, and the units are short, concise and to the
point. In every class, with the exception of the cooking,
each pupil has at the end of the unit completed something
to show and prove the value of her instruction, such as a
completed waist, or remodeled hat. This factor is far

reaching in its effect upon the attendance.

The independent unit system allows pupils to enter
throughout the vear and get the specific instruction they
wish. In this way, far more students are accommodated
than by longer courses, where one requires preceding
unit for its foundation.

The work was divided into the following units:

The following excerpts from the report of the Supervisor, Mrs. M. A. Carlon, will give more in detail the
progress of these classes:

‘When this country entered the great world conflict.
the need of economy all along the line became so apparent
as to cause the State Board of Education to urge all cooking teachers in the State-aided schools to attend Food
Conservation School in Cambridge, in May  conducted
by Miss Nash of Amherst College, for the purpose of learning the latest and most approved methods of conserving
food, and eliminating waste.

‘‘Karly in June, canning classes were started in the various publie schools covering every district in the city, and
where the attendance warranted, were continued with the
greatest success until the opening of the regular night
school term beginning October During this period,
  quart Jars of fruit and vegetables were put up by the
“‘cold pack method,’’ glasses of jelly and conserve,
and bottles of eatsup. fruit juices, ete., at an approximate value of .

. “Unlike the lessons conducted by organizations outside
of the schools, every pupil was obliged to prepare and ean
at least one jar of fruit or vegetable at each lesson, and |

home, and experiences exchanged, problems solved. for the
benefit of the entire class.

‘In this way, there was very little spoilage, and women

who had never attempted canning before, became our most
enthusiastic pupils and were eager to know more about
cooking in general way, many joining the regular course ,

‘‘Late in November we were asked to co-operate with
an organized body of Polish citizens in teaching fourteen
young women to knit the sweaters, socks, helmets and

class was conducted on Friday evenings, and on Tuesday
evening of every week, these young women taught classes of
fourteen other Polish women how to make the garments,
in the Polish school hall. Your Supervisor visited them
and inspected the work, and gave them the help most |
needed, besides winning the confidence of the ‘‘strangers
within our gates,’’ who have come to make up large portion of our loeal population.

to rip up out of style garments. clean and renovate them,

‘‘A very great interest has been taken by the general
public in the Home Nursing Department. We have three
classes at present taught by two graduate nurses, doing
real practical work, and have the co-operation of Miss
Doherty, Superintendent of the local City Hospital, who
has loaned exhibits used in the training school for nurses
at the hospital, and in various other ways, has been of a

very great service to us, for which we are most appreciative.

‘A factor very noticeable this year, is that pupils as
a rule progress from one class to another, getting the information and knowledge needed in each, thereby increasing their efficiency. ’’
CONCLUSION
In closing this section of the report, we wish to thank
the different department heads for their suggestions and reports to the Director from which this chapter has been compiled. To the many local employees, employers, labor men,

, REPORT OF THE

Gas and Electric Department
To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen.
Gentlemen :—
I have the honor to submit herewith the report of the
Gas and Electric Department for the year ending November the same being the fifteenth annual report of
the Department.

The amount of gas sent out in was  
cubie feet, an increase of only per cent over the sendout in  .

The amount of electricity generated during the year
was kilowatts while the current sent out amounted to kilowatts, an increase of only per cent
over the send-out in  The increase in the output of
both gas and electricity is unusually small. On the other
hand, the increased cost of every item in the manufacture
of both gas and electricity has greatly increased the operating cost and made sizeable deficit in our cash account.

. War time cost of gas oil, gas coal and wages at the gas
works exd the cost of the same items in by  and the increased cost of coal and wages at the
electric station amounts to making the total increased cost of coal, oil and wages In  ,
these three items cost  more than in  so that

the total increased cost above the cost in normal times is
about .

Out of the receipts,  has been paid for bonds

a
  REPORT OF GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT
retired—that is dividend the City gets from the users of
gas and electricity—by vote of the Board of aldermen;
$  was taken to apply on the loan account and
$  was paid for interest on outstanding bonds.

In the past five years,  has been taken from
the receipts of the department and credited to the account
the department owes to the City. The balance the department owes to the City today is  and it is to be
hoped that the City will not demand further payments on
its account until the department funds warrant the demand.

On July first last, it was found necessary to advance
the price of gas from cents thousand cubic feet net to
$  thousand ecubie feet net. This increase, about is only about one-third the increased cost of labor
and materials.

The loss in the operation of the Gas Works is not eDtirely due to war time prices of materials but can be largely
attributed to the failure of the vertical retorts. Last February contracts were made to rebuild the retorts of silica
and it was expected that the work of rebuilding would be
done last July, but it was not. The materials have not yet
arrived and we have no definite knowledge of when they
will arrive. Consequently, we are making and have been
obliged to make the last year, prineipally water gas, using
expensive coal and high priced gas oil in large quantities.

Greater plant capacity, particularly coal gas plant
with modern labor saying devices would probably reduce
operating cost and solve some difficulties but whether the
materials required for construction could be obtained dur:
ing these troublesome times is another question. Should it
become possible to obtain any or all of the machinery during the year .the department will ask you to sanction its
purehase. |

Notwithstanding the greatly increased cost in both
plants the department closes the year with profit of about
$ .

EE

REPORT OF GAS AND ELECTRIC DEFARTMENT  

The City owes debt of gratitude to the many loyal
workers in the department who resisted the temptation to
leave their work for greatly increased wages offered by
surrounding manufacturers. We admire their loyalty and
appreciate the sacrifices they made.

We also wish to record our appreciation of the work
of Mr. P. J. Dowd, manager of the Traffie Bureau of the
Chamber of Commerce, in obtaining supplies when the railroad congestion and embargoes made it difficult to keep
things going. Without his aid, the department would be
obliged to suspend operations at both the Gas Plant and
Electric Station.

The following is list of the bovs who have left the
department to enter into the service of the United States:
Michael Buckley Frank Musante
Jerome Moriarty Thomas Hoar
Timothy Greaney Patrick Dowd
James Bowler Francis Maloney.

William Marceau.
Respectfully submitted,
JOHN J. KIRKPATRICK,
Manager.
