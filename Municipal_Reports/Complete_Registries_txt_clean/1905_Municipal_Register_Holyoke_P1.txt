MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
Gentlemen of the Board of Aldermen:—

The year which has just closed and to which we have just

 bidden farewell has been one of growth and prosperity alike
for the citizens and the municipality of Holyoke. It has been
a period of marked industrial developinent. Many of our
manufacturing enterprises have enlarged thei plants aud a
number of them are planning to make vet further additions.

The Holyoke Water Power Company has well under way
its power station which, when completed. will add still more
fo the wealth producing ability of our city. The taxable valuation of property has been increased many hundreds of thousands of dollars. The municipality proper was never In much
better eondition. The obligations of the city have been met
when due, and we have been able to borrow money when necessary at very favorable rates. The several departments have
been in the main well conducted. am inelined to think that
those departments which are run most closely on business
principles stand best before the public and this fact furmshes
basis for the argument that constant effort should be made
to transact the affairs of the city with as much aeceuracy and
ecohomy as can be found in well regulated business establishments.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT.

The report of the City Auditor thoroughly describes the
financial condition of the city. The net debt of the city is
# This is of course large sum of money but when
the value of the assets of the city is considered it is relatively

  MAYOR'S ADDRESS

not an unduly large amount. During the last vear the city borrowed large sum of money but each loan was matter of
necessity and the total of the amount borrowed only exds
the amount of indebtedness paid off by Tt is cause
for satisfaction that the eity closed its books with all bills paid
except one contested elaim and balance on the right side of
the ledger of about  which was not spent but plaeed in
the sinking fund.

The custom of issuing serial bonds has been continued and
it would be matter to be deplored if the city should ever
depart from this pohey. In financial matters the past vear was
distinguished by the adoption of one distinctly new practice.
Iferetofore the dividends received from the Ilolyoke and Westfield Railroad have been paid into the city treasury and have
been expended for the needs of the city.

This past vear  of the amount received as dividend was placed in the sinking fund and this vear it is planned
to transfer to the sinking fund all of the dividend whieh may
be received in excess of four per cent which is kept to cover .
the sum paid by the city as interest on the bonds standing
against the stock. If this practice is followed hereafter the
sinking fund of the city will be put in such condition that
when the bonds issued against the stock eome due the issue
ean be refunded on serial basis and be retired in the course
of ten or fifteen vears, thus enabling the city at the end of that
period to possess the magnificent asset of the stock free from
any Incuimbran, ,

GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT.

The Gas and Electrie Department steadily grows in value
and effieency., At the gas works the plant has been increased by
the mstalling of some minor pieces of apparatus and the partial
erection of gas holder which will treble the storage capacity
of vas. There are still further improvements whieh must be
made at the gas works and when these are completed the plant
will be fitted to take care of all the business which is likely

MAYOR’S ADDRESS  
to come to it for many years. The decision of the gas and
electric light commission declining to reduce the amount which
must be set aside as depreciation fund makes impossible any
decrease in the price of gas this year.

The electric light plant has had added to it kilowat
steam turbine which when contracted for was eonsidered ample
provision for three or four years to come. So fast, however, has
the volume of business increased that the city must this year
install another turbine or else turn business away. The rapidity with which the electric light and power business has grown
is not only extremely gratifying but indeed wonderful. Every
eitizen of Holyoke should take pride in the splendid record
which these plants, belonging to the people as they do, have
made, and believe it is sound policy to so equip them that
they ean take care of any and all business which may be .
offered to them.

WATER DEPARTMENT. ;

The most important engineering feature of last year in
the water department was the completion of the so-ealled rock
eut. This undertaking was in the nature of necessity and
the water board is to be congratulated on its successful aceomplishment. The great achievement of the year, however, was
the reduction of the consumption of water from gallons per
capita to gallons per capita. This was true service to the
city and entitles not only the present board but former boards
who may: have laid plans for such result to the gratitude of
the people of Holyoke. am glad to say that the sinking fund
of the Water Department is in excellent condition. !

BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.

The record of the past year, aside from routine work, m
the department of Public Works has been marked by more
permanent construction than for many years. Northampton
street was finished, making fine boulevard. An excellent

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS

example of asphalt paving was laid on Maple street. More
wood block was placed on Main street and large amount of
macadam was constructed in different parts of the city.

The year has also seen the beginning of the Ward schoolhouse and storm water sewer for the district west of Maple
street. This last improvement is of the utmost importance and
should be completed as early as the weather will permit in the
spring. There are many matters which need attention this
vear and wise discrimination must be exercised to attend to
the more vital needs before spending money on the less essential. The repaving of High street would seem to be publie
necessity as is the construction of bridge or foot pass over
or under the tracks of the Holvoke Westfield Railroad at
Jackson street. )

THE SCHOOLS.
The schools are after all the most nmportant municipal
department. On their work depends in large measure the
 character of the citizenship of the community. Despite some
eriticism beheve the officials and teachers of our schools are
efficient, faithful and high-minded and the results which they }
accomplish are creditable alike to them and to the eity. The
eitizens of Holyoke should talk up their schools. By creating
a pride in them it will make it all the easier for the members
of the School Board and the Superintendent to withstand
political pressure and conduct the sehools on igh plane.
The needs of the department are always increasing. During
, the past vear, new sixteen room building has been begun in
Ward and in the not distant future better accommodations
will be required in the North Chestnut and South Chestnut
street districts. The finances of the school department have
been managed with great skill and the members of the School
Board and the Superintendent are entitled to much praise for
their suecess in this respect. The appointment of third
truant officer seemed to me an unnecessary expense but now
that the offiee has been created the matter should be given a

MAYOR’S ADDRESS  S
fair trial and the officials should be accorded every opportunity
to prove their usefulness.

FIRE DEPARTMENT.

It is always difficult to speak of the Fire Department
except in words of praise. Year after year the record of the
department is uniformly good. During the year just ended,
the efficiency of the force has been increased by the addition
of new men, the adoption of the plan giving an extra day off
a month and the raising the maximum pay to nine hundred
dollars year. The department has worked in harmony and
its general discipline and tone have been high.

POLICE DEPARTMENT.

The work of the Police Department is always difficult.
The average person believes in the enforcement of law except
when it touches him personally and then he usually rebels. In
spite of this the city of Holyoke is in the main clean, moral,
orderly and law abiding community. The grosser erimes are
very rare and life, Imb and property are reasonably secure
and safe. The police department is not perfect but honestly
believe we get about as good results with as little friction as
ean be found in any city of our class. Although the City
Marshal does not mention it, think that provision should be
made for one more patrolman so that the Elmwood district ean
have police protection during the day, something which it is
now entirely without.

; PARKS.

The past year has witnessed much progress in the development of the park system of Holyoke. Under the direction of
our able Park Board Elmwood Park has been put in condition
so that its complete development is nearly at hand. conerete
terrace wall feet in length, of great beauty and strength,

  MAYOR'S ADDRESS

has been constructed in Prospect Park and the park area of
the city has been nearly doubled by the purchase of Springdale
Park now to be known as Riverside Park. believe this purchase is one of the best things which was done last year and
if it becomes as planned, the peoples’ playground, it will be
the most valuable park which the city will possess. This vear
steps should be taken for the extension of Elmwood Park by
the purchase of additional land.

HEALTH DEPARTMENT.

Of the Health Department there is little to be said except
in the way of commendation. The general health of the city
and its freedom from contagious diseases speaks more eloquently for the work of this department than could any words
of mine.

THE LAW DEPARTMENT.

The report of the City Solicitor shows that the legal
business of the city has received most careful attention and the
fact that there is only one damage suit pending against the
city is eause for congratulation. The suggestion of the City
Solicitor that the further construction of the smooth glass
sidewalks be prohibited is worthy of serious consideration.

CITY AUDITOR.

The work of the year has again demonstrated the importance of the office of City Auditor. Some provision should be
made so that the Auditor ean give more of his attention to the
larger problems of city finances and be relieved sonrewhat of
mere detail and mechanical labor.

ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT.

The work demanded of the engineering department. inereases each year. During the past year the Park Board and

MAYOR’S ADDRESS  
Gas and Electric Departments have required large amount
of engineering assistance, which has greatly augmented the
usual routine work. Mr. Tighe and his assistants have performed their duties in careful and conscientious manner and
the field of their labor is set out at length in the annual report
of the department which contains much infortnation of value
and interest.

ASSESSORS.

The Assessors have performed their very difficult task
with uniform honesty and fairness and the satisfactory conduet of their office is shown by the freedom of the city from
tax litigation.

CITY TREASURER AND TAX COLLECTOR.

The City Treasurer and the Tax Collector have so conducted their offices as to receive deserved praise from business
men who have had occasion to deal with the eity and notice
its methods.

OVERSEERS OF THE POOR.

The report of the Overseers of the Poor shows that careful
attention has been given to the very difficult task which each
vear confronts them.

The City Physician has attended to the duties of his
department an efficient manner.

The careful, conscientious work of the Inspector of Milk
should not be underestimated or forgotten.

The other departments and officials have served the city well
in their various capacities and the absence of specific mention
implies no disparagement of their work.

These general words of commendation for the several
departments do not, however, imply that they are perfectly
conducted or that there is not room in each one of them for
improvement. There is not department in the eity which

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS .
cannot give better service to the people than it is giving at
present and it should be the aim. of all the departments to make
their work this year more efficient than it has ever been before.
With you, Gentlemen of the Board of Aldermen, and with
the Mayor, rests the general oversight of the business of the
city.
The citizens of Holyoke look to us for wise, honest and
conservative administration of affairs and it should be our
purpose to so govern our official conduct that by our help
Holyoke shall become better and purer place to live for those
who love it and who call it home.

REPORT OF
OFFICE OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS,
HouyoxkeE, Mass., Dee. .
To the Honorable Mayor and City Council:

GENTLEMEN: Your Board of Fire Commissioners take
pleasure in presenting their report for the year ending December |

The Board organized January by the election of
Charles L. Newcomb, as chairman, G. J. Prew as vice-chairman
and John Hildreth as secretary. Your Commissioners have
held nineteen regular meetings and many informal meetings
during the past year.

The year just closed has been busy one for the Fire
Department, fires and alarms, with total loss of only
$  shows how well the firemen have done their work
and speaks well for the efficiency, skill and intelligence of both
officers and men in managing these fires. The total insurance

paid on all fire losses was leaving net loss of only
$  or an average loss per fire of and, of this amount
$  was caused by the burning of barn near Ashley Ponds,
belonging to the city, upon which there was no insurance and
Which was destroyed before the department could reach the

 Place of the fire, leaving only  net loss above insurance,
showing that our citizens keep their property well insured. A
detailed account of fires will be found under the head of fires
and alarms.

|
  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS ,
The fourth year of the permanent fire department con: firms the good judgment of the city in changing from call
force to permanent force. In.a few moments after an alarm
I has rung, we have at the scene of the fire sufficient force of
! trained active men, all ready to man the apparatus and attack
the fire. The first few‘minutes determines the character of the a
fire. One of the most expensive fires we had this year was the
 one at the Holyoke Paper Mill, stock of valuable paper was
| in twenty minutes damaged this shows how minutes
count in fire fighting. As usual large number of fires where
there was heavy losses occurred in the suburbs of the city and
: before the department got there the property was destroyed.
We regret to say that two persons lost their lives through fire
this past year, one woman named Deborah Courtney, and
the other child, named Annie Lanirade; these terrible accidents occurring as they do year by year emphasize the necessity
of getting to the scene of the fire with all possible dispatch,
and we urge all citizens to assist the department by keeping
the streets clear, so that there may be no hindrances to the
firemen on the way to fire. slight delay may mean loss
of precious human lives, and great damage to property. Many
| of the fires during the past year had in them dangerous possi| bilities, but prompt and intelligent work prevented them
! becoming serious. .
| The dangerous work of the firemen is well known, so that
, it Is not necessary to speak of it except to say that we are glad
to report that none of the firemen have suffered permanent
injury although some were badly hurt. :
Your Cammissioners are gratified at. the result of the
vear’s work and we feel sure that this gratification is shared by
our citizens generally. .

The expenses of the department have been increased by
the rebuilding of two hose wagons and equipping same with
rubber tires making them the finest hose wagons we know of
anywhere. We have also put into the department fine chemi- 
eal and hook and ladder truck at Elmwood, greatly strengthenIng the department at this point. |

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS i

We have used the money appropriated for carrying on the
department as economically as possible and believe that an
examination of our account will show that the money has been.
well expended.

Your Commissioners commend the chief and officers and
men for the excellent work done by them in the performance
of their dangerous duties. Many deeds of heroism and daring
are done by them that pass unnoticed; so we take this opportunity of expressing to them our appreciation of their faithful
service. ;

We thank your Honorable Mayor and Board of Aldermen
for the liberal appropriation made last year and suggest that
in the matter of salary we shall need more money than last
year to enable us to pay the men the amount due them under
the rules of the Board, which provides for an annual raise
until maximum salaries are reached. The fire department has
been placed under Civil Service rule.

We make the following recommendations which we trust
will receive your careful attention:

First. We reiterate with increased emphasis our recommendation to replace House No.  We have urged for number of years that lot of land be purchased but the various
Boards of Aldermen have failed to appropriate the money for
this purpose. We are glad to notice that the city government
is taking this matter up. It must be evident to all who give
this matter consideration that it is growing more diffieult each
year that we delay, to secure lot for an engine house. little
investigation on the part of the city government would, we are
satisfied, convinee them of the necessity of new house for
many reasons; first, the location is bad one on account of the
crowded nature of the thoroughfare upon which it stands;
second, it is not large enough to accommodate the, apparatus —
and men that are now there: and third, it is impossible to keep
any horses for engine No. on the premises so that in case of
fire, the engine at this point cannot get. there till lone after the
rest of the apparatus,. because it has to depend upon hired
horses. This state of things ought not to be allowed to exist,

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS ,

but your Commissioners are helpless in this matter, and can

only continue to recommend new house. The present engine

house can be sold for very nearly enough to build new house,
| and it would seem to be good business to take this step.

Second. We again report for the fifth successive year our
recommendation that House No. be enlarged, in accordance

with the plans of our city engineer, and that the extension
should be placed on the west side of the house. The quarters
in this house are altogether too small for the apparatus and the
horses, and we have to pay every year considerable for the
board of sick horses because we cannot accommodate them.

Third. We repeat our recommendation that engine No.  

should be overhauled and equipped with new boiler. This is
absolutely necessary as this piece of apparatus has been in
active service for more than twenty years, and it is unwise to
keep it in service much longer unless the changes above suggested are made.

Fourth. We again recommend that House No.  situated
in Ward  should be sold and new up-to-date engine house
erected near the center of the ward. This ward is building up
so fast that unless steps are soon taken to secure lot it will
be practically impossible to get one.

Fifth. In making the appropriations we trust that you
will make them large enough so that we can install the coming
year the Pompei Ladder Drill.

Sirth. The Commissioners also recommend that the
Board of Aldermen vive the Fire Commissioners power to take
advantave of the state law, for the pensioning of firemen, who
are incapacitated from performing the duties of firemen; from
old age, or from injury, received by them in the performance

of their duty as firemen.

Seventh. We earnestly urge the Water Commissioners to
install more hydrants as it is very much cheaper in the long
run to install hydrants which are permanent in their character,
than to keep on buying so much hose which deteriorates so
soon and has to be replaced at frequent intervals. We are glad

that the Commissioners have begun the work and hope that
they will continue it with more vigor.

APPARATUS.

We have been vradually rebuilding and equipping with
rubber tires, the appartus in the department, and most of it  s
now in splendid condition, Steamer No. being notable
exception. This engine must be rebuilt very soon. We have
rebuilt two hose wagons this year and put in new combination chemical and hook and ladder truck at Elmwood. The
apparatus now in active service consists of six steam engines
and one spare engine, two double tank chemical engines, one
eombination hose and ehemical truek, five two horse hose
wagons, one wnrial truek, two hook and ladder trucks, one
three horse despatch wagon, six exercise and supply wagons,
one chief’s buevy, twenty-six three gallon chemical extinguishers, one superintendent of fire alarm wagon, three sleighs.

INOUSES.

The houses have been for the past year in very poor eondition, both externally and internally, but we are glad to say
that the Board of Public Works have taken steps to put the
houses in good shape, for which we are very glad.

HOSE.

We have purchased feet during the past vear and it

will be necessary to purchase considerable more in the coming

HAY AND FEED.

We have the usual quantity of hay, bedding and feed on

HORSES.

We have forty-one horses in the department. Three of
these we were obliged to purchase during the last year and
until sone form of horseless carriage can be devised, this
branch of our service will be very expensive. We have, during
the past year, examined number of horseless carriages and
ni that, while they have made great improvements in this
ine of work, we do not think it wise to put them in the department at present.

FIRE ALARM TELEGRAPII.

' During the past year we have put in five new fire alarm
ae viz.: Box No.  at the corner of Berkshire and Main
Ne ain box No.  for the Ilolyoke Plush Company, box
Si for the Holyoke Warp Company box No.  for the
voke Ps Manufacturing Company box No.  for the Holaper Company, the last four named being private boxes.

! REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS
The necessity for putting the wires underground in the thickly
settled portions of our city grows more and more imperative
each year. Publie safety demands that this improvement be
| undertaken as soon as possible. The risk of the overhead
| system is too great to be continued longer than is absolutely
| necessary. We have come to depend so much on the efficieney
of the fire alarm system that failure in this direction might :
result in loss of both life and property and public safety
demands that everything possible should be done to perfect this
branch of our service. We again commend the superintendent
of this department for the excellent manner in which. it has
been conducted.

REPORT OF THE
Gas and Electric Department.
Ciry oF HOLYOKE, Mass. |

OFFICE OF GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPT.
December |

To the Honorable, the Mayor and the Board of Aldermen:
GENTLEMEN: hand you herewith the third annual
report of the Gas and Electric Department. The chief item
of moment to be called to your attention is the increased and
increasing volume of business transacted from the gas works
and the electric station. From the former, there has been sold
  cubic feet more gas than during  an increase
of per cent; while from the latter, there is being sent
out about per cent more current than at this time year
ago. During the year, at the station, there have been installed
one kilowatt turbo generator with ample condensing apparatus and three horsepower boilers, practically doubling the
steam capacity of the plant. The plant, at the rated eapacity
of the generators, is now equipped to furnish horsepower
in electric current with water and steam power run together;
but it can furnish only horsepower in current with steam
power alone. When the turbo generator was purchased last
Winter, it was thought that the equipment would be large
enough to take care of the growth of the business for some
years but the station has already almost reached the limit of
its capacity, it being able to take on only about twenty per cent
more business with its combined water and steam power, and
has reached the rated capacity of the steam plant. During the
past fall, the four remaining mill powers of the sixteen, appur  GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT

tenant to the plant, were taken: but the business has increased
so much, that some steam power has to be used every day in
addition to the water power, as the water wheels do not furnish
power enough for the daylight load alone.

All this leads up to the fact that the situation at the station
is this: When the day and the night loads lap, as they do from
sunset until p.m., per cent of the combined water and
steam power is being used, and in ease of the water being shut
off by any cause, the whole of the rated steam power is being
used. This means that, within comparatively short time, the
department will have to refuse to take on new business, through |
its inability to handle it, unless more generating apparatus is
added to the station. In my opinion, the department should
be given the necessary authority to add to the equipment at
the station one K.W., or TEP... umit including the
steam power and electric generators. Would also respect fully
suggest that action upon this extension be taken as early in the
year as possible, as the eleetrie machinery manufacturers are
so crowded with orders, that to meet our needs the coming
fall, it is necessary to order this machinery as early in the
season as possible.

Another matter of pressing importance to be considered
in connection with the addition to the power at the station is
eoal storage. Inereasing business means an inereasing consumption of coal. The storage capacity at the station now is
not over tons as the maximum, nor is there room there
anvwhere for more. To be surely in position to handle whatever demand for current that may come, sufficient lot of land
that is conveniently situated with regards railroad facilities
and the station should be aequired to give storage ample for a
winter's supply of coal. TP would reeommend that the department be authorized to purchase such lot of land.

With the additions, rearrangements and repairs of the
past two vears, the city now has an eleetric station that it may
feel proud of. :

At. the gas works, the necessary and usual repairs have
been made including painting, patching of buildings and roofs,

GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT  
resetting two benches of retorts, relining different parts of the
water gas apparatus, and inspecting the street mains for leaks.
There has been added to the apparatus one new exhauster of
double the capacity of the one it displaced. The old exhauster

. has been connected up to handle only water gas. With this
rearrangement of the handling of the gas, with the use of the
shavings serubber, installed last year, the works are able to care
for at least per cent more gas than under the old arrangement. There has also been added new Sturtevant blower as
a safecuard in ease of aecident to the one already installed.
The new gas holder, wpon whieh work has been delayed for
about six weeks, owing to the failure of the rolling mulls to
deliver the iron in the time promised, is now progressing: satisfactorily, and should be finished inside of two months. plot
of Jand contaimme square feet was purchased for the
site of this holder. Tt is situated upon Canal street about  
feet south of Mosher street. This is considered to be very
favorable situation for the holder. Upon the land, there has
been built boiler house containme LLP. boiler to furnish
the steam necessary to prevent the water in the holder tank and
eups from freezing. There have been laid miles of street
mains of various sizes and new serviee pipes. There have
also been placed in the mains twenty-four new gate
valves.

Owing to the constantly inereasing difficulty in getting an
adequate supply of eoal during the winter season, because of
the immense and increasing amount of railroad traffic, the gas
works should have coal shed capable of storing enough coal to
last from December first of anv year until the first of the next
April. As at present arranged, the works cannot store coal
enough to last two months from the first of December. While
owing to the lack of yard room, there never can be built an
adequate storage there, it would seem best to provide for as
mueh as possible under the circumstances.

There is one other addition needed at the gas works, the
duplication of the water gas apparatus. While the present
apparatus is of ample capacity, when it ean be run, there are

  GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT |
times it has to be thrown out of commission for repairs, when
no gas can be made with it. With the large and constantly
growing business done at the works, it is taking chances in not
having another water gas set to fall back upon in case of
accident to the existing one. It is the almost universal practice
of gas works, the country over, to have these sets in duplicate.
If these two additions be made to the gas plant, unless an unforeseen amount of business develops, there will not need anything of moment to be added to the works for several years.
I recommend that the department be authorized to extend the
coal shed and duplicate the water gas apparatus.

REPORT OF THE
Inspector of Milk, Vinegar
and Petroleum. :
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR,
City ITALL, HOLYOKE, Mass.,  .
To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen:

I have the honor to submit herewith the following report
as Inspector of Milk, Vinegar, and Petroleum, for the City of
Holyoke, for the year ending November .

MILK. )

Making the total number of quarts of sweet milk  ,

year; which at the retail value of milk and cream as sold in
this city, amounts to .

Number of milk samples tested, ree 
Number of butter samples tested,  ... wt  
Number of vinegar samples tested,  ..SsW 

  INSPECTOR OF MILK, VINEGAR AND PETROLEUM
Number of kerosene oil samples tested  
Number of prosecutions, .:.  
Number of warnings sent, milk,  
Number of warnings sent, wooden plugs, ..  

There have been ten prosecutions this year, all for selling
milk of not good standard quality. Three parties were fined
$  each, six were fined  each, and one .

| All these paid their fines except one, who appealed to the
Superior Court on the grounds that the milk was not sold.

I have sent out warnings and all but the ones that have
been fined, have paid attention to them, and these escaped
prosecution.

A sample of milk brought to me for examination appeared
to be milk taken from cow too soon after calving. Upon
investigation this proved to be the fact.

The way milk is brought me for test or examination is, to
say the least, unsatisfactory. In one ease the milk, one-half
ounce, was in dirty medicine bottle; another, about four
ounces, in half-pint flask that was stained with dirt on the
inside and smelled of wintergreen. Of course nothing can be
done with samples of this kind. Bring me all the milk just
as you receive it, in the same container, and as soon as possible
after you get it; then ean test it.

The license of one peddler was revoked by order of the
Board of Health for having dirty wagon and was renewed
only after he had obtained another wagon that was acceptable.
Almost all the wagons are in good condition, but few are not
in good shape.

The wooden plug dves not come to Tlolvoke any more. I
have been able to find but three in the past year.

T have been with Health Officer Linnehan few times and
he has helped me several times.

The Babeock tester operated by electrie power has been
in use now for over vear and enables me to do more and
better work than could with the old hand machine.

INSPECTOR OF MILK, VINEGAR AND PETROLEUM  
VINEGAR. |

I have tested samples of vinegar and found them all
up to the standard, except two that were brought in by dealers
who wished them tested before they bought,

OLEOMARGARINE.

I have issued but two licenses for oleomargarine, one for
a store and one peddler.

BUTTER.

One party was fined for selling renovated butter, not
being properly marked. This party was prosecuted by State
Agent Harwood.

In March found renovated butter in tubs from which the

. revenue stamps had been removed, in seven stores. These
cases turned over to E. L. Kirtland, Deputy Collector.
PETROLEUM.

I have tested samples from tank cars and found them
all lawful oil. There has been no attempt to send poor oil into
the city this year, as has been the case almost every year of late.

I have had great assistance from the Health Officer and
the Board of Health, also from my Collector of Samples. .

I thank the City Marshal and the patrolmen for the help

they have given me.
Respectfully submitted,
JAMES K. MORRILL,
Inspector of Milk and Vinegar.

 REPORT OF CITY SOLICITOR

The Committee on Claims also gave hearings in number
of eases in which the petitioners were granted leave to withdraw.

| The only action for damages now pending is that of
Maurice J. Moynihan vs. City of Holyoke.

This was for personal injury sustained by reason of fall
upon the sidewalk on the southerly side of Dwight street,

. adjoining the premises occupied by Messrs. MeAuslan &
Wakelin.

At the trial in the Superior Court the jury awarded the
plaintiff damages in the sum of .

The ease will go to the Supreme Court.

It is becoming serious question as to the extent to which
the city should permit the construetion of sidewalks of smooth
material sueh as iron, glass and artifielal stone. The ‘‘Ilvatt
Liehts,’’ so-called, are great convenience to the users; but,  m
the city’s interest,  would appear that some method ought to
be devised for rendering the surface less smooth and slippery.

. It is of importance to the city that defects in sidewalks,
; area eratings, ete., should be immediately reported.
- know of no more effective method than reports by patrolmen to the City Marshal, and would suvgest that attention be
directed to the necessity for careful inspection,
| To the various officials and departments, for their wmiwavering assistance and courtesy, desire to express my obligation.
Respectfully submitted,
MICHAEL J. GRIFFIN,
| Holvoke, Mass., December City Soheitor.

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER  
streets, from the center of Hampshire street to point feet
north of the north line of Sargeant street, by the laying of  
feet of  -inch vitrified pipe; surface water sewer, constructed of  -inch vitrified pipe, laid from the Main street
sewer easterly through the alley north of Chase and Cooledge
building to the alley east of Main street, thence in the alley
east of Main street and rear of the Boston Maine Railroad
Company’s property for distance of feet.

Upon the recommendation made by the Engineering Department last year, in regard to the relieving of the Walnut ,
street and portion of the Front street systems, by the construction of new storm water system, the work has been commenced by the laying of  -inch vitrified pipe in Walnut
street from Appleton street to Essex street; an  -inch vitrified
pipe from Essex street to Cabot street and an  -inch vitrified
pipe in Essex street from Walnut street to Oak street.
| It is recommended that the remaining portion of the trunk
sewer of this system be completed as soon as possible. Its
course will continue in Walnut street to Suffolk street, thenee
westerly in Suffolk street to Pine street, thenee northerly in
Pine street to the Connecticut river. As designed, its diseharging eapacity will be sufficient to convey per cent of an
ineh of rain falling per hour on all the territory draining towards Walnut and Pine streets east of Nonotuek street and
north of Sargeant street. This discharging capacity together
with the discharging capacity of the present sewers should be
sufficient to convey all drainage, surface and otherwise, except
what might oecur In most phenomenal storm.

It is desirable that the Ingleside system he extended so
that all residences within the territory of Ingleside terrace, —
so-called, can be connected therewith.

It is also desirable that some provision be made for sewerage system west of Northampton street, especially in that
territory known as the Cleary tract.

HIGHWAYS.

With the exeeption of the new permanent pavements, the
most Hnporiant work done in the highway department was
the relocating and widening of Northampton street from
Morgan street to the Northampton tine. This) portion. of
Northampton street has been drained and widened from a
width of  feet to width of feet.

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER  

The street railway track has been relocated and placed in
the center of the street, the old rails being replaced by
grooved rails and the space between them paved with vitrified
paving briek. Outside the rails is maeadamized and the street
now looks more like well laid out boulevard than corduroy
country road. The total cost of this improvement was ,
not including the changes made in relocating the street railway
and paving between the rails.

Maple street, from the southerly line of Fountain street
to the northerly line of Lyman street, from the southerly Ime
of Lyman street. to the sontherly line of TTampden street, from
the northerly line of Suffolk street to the northerly line of
Appleton street and from the southerly Ime of Appleton street
to the northerly line of Cabot street has been paved wih sheet
asphalt.

Suffolk street, from the westerly Ine of Tigh street to the
westerly line of Chestnut sireet, and Essex street, from the
westerly line of Thigh street to Maple street has also been paved
with sheet asphalt.

The westerly side of Main street, between Appleton and
Dwight streets, has been paved with Creodone wood blocks.

The granite blocks on Main street, replaced by Creodone
wood bloek, has been used in paving Sargeant street, between
the First and Second level canals.

The alley adjoining City Tall lot, from High street to the
west side of Newton place, has been paved with vitrified brick
block and across Newton place with granite block. Wood block
paving has been laid in the alley east of Ihgh street between
Dwight street and John street. The pavement in the latter
alley was laid on concrete base while in the former alley it
was laid on gravel base.

In the coming year new pavement should be laid on
High strect from Appleton street to Dwight street. between the
outside rails of the Street Railway Company's tracks and the
eurhs. The paving of Suffolk and Main streets should also
be extended.

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER

Perhaps there is no thoroughfare in the city, having the
same amount of traffic, requiring permanent pavement more
than the west end of Appleton street between Bh and
Pleasant streets. On account of the topographical nature of
the territory abutting this portion of the street the surface
drainage is hard to control and in heavy rain storms flows over
the surface of the street thus leaving ruts and washouts in its
course.

CURBING AND SIDEWALKS.

For the number of lineal feet of curbing set, and square
yards of new sidewalks laid and old sidewalks re-surfaced,
together with all work done in connection with maintenance,
ete., you are respectfully referred to the report of the Board
of Public Works.

BRIDGES.
While, generally speaking, all our bridges are in fair condition, as compared with other years, it would be advisable,
as already recommended in previous reports, to replace some

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER  
of the older structures by new ones of more modern type. At
what time an old metal bridge may become dangerous and
collapse, can hardly, if ever, be determined beforehand, hence
the more reason why new bridge should replace, every year,
one of the older ones until the latter are all replaced.

PARK AND MUNICIPAL LIGHTING DEPARTMENTS.
The work done in the Park Department consisted in the
construction of masonry overflow for an artificial pond in
Elmwood Park; the construction of concrete terrace wall,  
feet in length, on the north side of Prospect Park; survey
and cross section of Springdale Park and the staking out and
locating of paths, drives and shrubbery plats in the same, as
directed by Mr. Olmstead, the Park Commissioners’ landscape
architect.

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER

In the Lighting Department the work consisted mainly in
a survey and cross section of lot of land, proposed to be
purchased for the new gas holder, abutting the Connecticut
River, in the rear of the American Writing Paper Company’s
property known as the Crocker Division, together with plans
and estimates of retaining wall to be constructed on the water
side of the same; the laying of masonry concrete foundation,
  feet in thickness, for the new gas holder, finally located on ,
the west side of Canal street, south of Mosher street; the
erection of boiler house and brick chimney on the same lot
and the alignment and grade of feet of  -inch east iron
pipe, the latter work alone occupying the whole time of one
of the assistants of the Engineering Department for days.

The total time given to these.two departments during the
year, for one man, covered period of days. This additional work which has, especially in the Park Department, so
abnormally grown in magnitude together with the normal
Increase of work in the other departments, has increased the
work of the Engineering Department at least per cent more
than what it was five years sinee.

that were made in connection with the above mentioned works:

Eliynwood Park.

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER  

Large map of the entire city for the Electric Lighting
Station. WATER WORKS.

The large meters installed near the close of last year for
measuring the total quantity of water used in the city have
already borne good results. The extraordinary high consumption, as recorded by them, led to more vigilant inspection of
leaky fixtures, ete., and the installation of small meters in
places of business where great waste was suspected, the result
being that the consumption has been decreased from gallons per capita per day, as recorded last year, to gallons per
capita per day as recorded the last week in November of this
year.

For the other works and operations of the Water Depart| ment, you are respectfully referred to the report of the Board
of Water Commissioners.
BUILDING INSPECTION.

On account of the greater size and number of structures
that are now being erected, in comparison with few years
ago, the inspection of buildings commands considerably more
time and attention than ever before.

Below is table showing list of the plans and speeifieations approved by the Building Inspector during the year, for
all buildings to be erected within the fire limits:

REPORT OF
Board of Public Works.
City oF HoLyoKE, Mass.
OFFICE THE BOARD OF PUBLIC WoRKS,
December .

To the Honorable, the Mayor and the Members of the Board of
Aldermen, of the City of Holyoke, Massachusetts. GENTLEMEN: We present to you herewith the ninth annual report of the Board for the fiscal year ending November

  .

. The Board opines that it is wise for the city to add to the
permanent street work each year. We have performed considerable amount of work of this nature this year. For the
convenience of travelers, the safety of the public, and the beautifying of the city, we would recommend loan for the coming
year of seventy-five thousand ($ dollars for street
work.

Recommendations made in past years for storm water
sewer to cover the section of the city bounded on the west by
Pleasant street, on the east by Elm street, on the south by
Cabot street, and on the north by the river, have met with
approval and sdme progress has been made the current season.
A twenty-four inch Akron pipe sewer was construeted in

  REP)RE OF BJARD OF PUBLID WORKS

Walnut street, from Appleton street to Cabot street, and an
eighteen inch Akron pipe sewer in Essex street, from
Walnut strect to Oak street. This system for caring for the
storm water should be extended to the river at once, in order
that the present sewer systems may not be overtaxed.

The new Ilighland sewer, together with the sewers on
Northampton street and River terrace, were completed this
year.

A general demand for sidewalks and curbing, much in
excess of what the Board can grant with the money at its
disposal, has been made this year. lhberal appropriation, in
our opinion, should be made to provide sidewalks and curbing
for people desiring the same.

The Board has to report the accomplishment of the redecorating and repairing of the auditorium, and the vestibule
leading thereto, in the City Hall building. This work was
completed at cost of very nearly six thousand ($ )
dollars.

We have to continue recommendations made in the past
for the ereetion of new buildings and for the establishment of
anew City Yard. We would recommend the Berkshire street
lot, so-called, as practical location. This lot contains eightyseven thousand five hundred and ninety-one square
fect, is owned by the city, and the present yard site contains
only thirty-six thousand square feet. The Berkshire
street lot contains much more ground surfaee. It  possible
for suitable structures to be erected on the Berkshire street
lot, and when this is done the Board recommends that the
present City Yard site and buildings be disposed of.

New boilers have been reeommended by the Hartford
Steam Boiler Inspection and Insuranee Company in some of
the buildings. The Board recommends new battery of boilers
at the City Farm. It will also be necessary to install two boilers of modern type in the City Hall, owing to age and weakness
of the present boilers. 

Krom the list of repairs suggested in the school buildings

REPURT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
by the school board and in the engine houses by the fire commissioners, we believe that, should this work be done, sizable
Increase in the appropriation for the department of city property must be made the coming year.

Owing to the increase in the number of tenement blocks
and dwelling houses constructed during the current year, also
to the greater distanee of the haul and to changes made by
persons over whom the Board has no control, necessitating the
ehanging of dumping ground sites, material inerease in the
alley department appropriation must be made.

: few additional street watering carts are needed, owing
to the wearing out of the present carts. This fact, tovether
with the laving out of additional territory to be sprinkled,
will require additional money.

It has been noted that eertain streets in the business seetion of the eity are poorly lighted during portions of the
nicht, and especially upon the nights when the stores and business places are closed. We would therefore suggest that, if
possible. extra Hights be furnished for these streets. This ean
only be done provided that more money is granted the hghting
department.

A departure has been made during the eurrent vear in the
matter of the letting of the contract for the collection and disposal of garbave, which has hitherto been awarded for one
year only. contract was made this season for term of
years. The Board beheves that this will be advantageous to
the city, In that the persons caring for this material will become
more conversant with the territory covered. The cost to the
city has been no more than under the old system.

For tabulated list of sewers built by this department. in
  we would refer you to table in the report of the City
Engineer, which shows the location of the sewer, the alignment,
its place of beginning and ending, the material of which it  s
constructed, its size, length, average depth, number of manholes, cost per foot, and the system to which it belongs; also
the formation of the earth through which it passes.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
From the tables hereunto annexed complete information
may be obtained as to the cost of the various items of work
performed this year. |

REPORT OF THE
PARK COMMISSIONERS.
To His Honor and the Board of Aldermen:

In accordance with the provisions of the statutes, we beg
to present herewith our report of the work accomplished the
past year, and trust it may meet with your approval and that
our requests and recommendations may have your support
and co-operation. The year just passed has been an active
one and more progréss has been made than any other year
towards improvements and additions, notably the taking of
Springdale Driving Park for public park and the long delayed improvements on Prospect Park. All the other parks
have received their full share of attention and in most cases
some improvements have been made. As result we find the
parks at the end of the season in excellent condition with bright
prospects ahead for the future.

In reviewing the work accomplished the past year we
would call your special attention to the improvements begun on
Prospect Park as being of great importance, and which when
completed, will change entirely the general appearance of this
place. To the stranger coming through our city by train the
approach from the railroad side will be imposing and pleasing,
and cannot fail to establish in their minds very favorable
impression of our city. We ask your co-operation in helping
us to make start towards the development of our newly acquuired property in Springdale. We are anxious to get the play
# rounds and athletic fields started so that they can be used the
-oming season. Already we have had many applications for the

  REPORT OF THE PARK COMMISSIONERS

use of the fields which shows that our citizens, who are lovers of
out-door sports, are anticipating the use of these fields which
the city will furnish for their enjoyment.

Following is complete record of our receipts and disbursements for the past year together with detailed statement of our expenditures. |

We present herewith brief resume of the condition and

the work accomplished on each park during the past year.
RIVERSIDE PARK.

Early in the spring negotiaticns were begun towards acquiring the tract of land known as ‘Springdale Driving Park”?
situated in Scuth Helyoke, but not being able to obtain this
land through negotiation they exereised their authority as eonferred on them by the General Statutes by taking possession
through eondemnation and fixing the value thereof at ,
which sum has since been accepted and paid over to the owner.

We have had preliminary plans drawn for the improvements of this tract whieh has been named Riverside Park.
Landscape engineers are now at work on details and ground
plans, which when finished will show what beautiful and
useful place it will be, serving not only for the lower portion
of the city who have long required larger park area, but also
the entire eity by the fine facilities offered for sports of all
kinds. The general plan calls for an entranee at the northwest corner which opens onto broad promenade whieh follows elese to the river around to another entrance on the southwest corner, then continuing aleng Main strect, affording a
fine stretch of walk all the way around. Jn the eenter will be
suitable and spacious grounds for baseball, football, ericket,
ete, On the Main street will be wide terrace raised to the
level of the street. On this terrace will be seats so arranged —
that the people can view the games and have easy access to the

REPORT OF THE PARK COMMISSIONERS  
tennis courts which will be directly in front. On the north end
will be the play ground for the voung children, consisting of
a wading pool, sand courts, merry-go-round, swings, ete. Adjoining will be the sanitaries and shelters for both men and
women, While farther to the East will be an-cpen air gymnasim and amusements fer the older enes. At the southeast ,
corner will be grove where pieme parties may enjoy themselves and families may congregate fer meal in the ecol shade
on the river bank. Shelter and tables will be furnished for
such purposes: boating facilities will be established under
preper restrictions and also bathhcuses for the men, women
and children. It is intended to make the place pepular with
all classes and to afferd ample faeilities for the enjevinent of
all, In time we hope to make this very attractive place and
ene whieh wemen and children ean go to at all times with perfect safety. We consider this very valuable additicn to the
city. and if the necessary funds are available will eommence
the eoming vear the development cf this preperty.

PROSPECT PARK.

The Board has had in contemplation for long time the
erection of suitable wall on the railroad bank, both as matter of safety and ornament but thev have never been able to
start on the project owing to lack of funds. This year, however,
the Necessary apprepriaticn was made fer part of it and start
has been mode, one-half ef the wall being built this year and
We hepe to be able to complete during the coming year, this
™pertant undertaking. We ecnsider it the greatest improvement and addition that has been made to any of the parks, and
When all is completed and the grounds graded to eorrespond
Will make vast improvement to this park and ecannet help but
he appreciated by all. The wall runs aleng the edve cf the
park land adjoining the railroad land. It is three fect high
an twenty inches wide with suitable pilasters every ten feet.
There will be four outlooks, one at head cf each street running
to the park; from the outlooks beautiful view of the river and

| surrounding country is obtained as well as the cool breezes
| from the river. Seats will be arranged around the outlooks. It
| is intended to grade on the railread side and plant with shrubs
bos and flowers, ete., which will make it very attractive from that
 
Pou side. broad promenade will follow along the wall whieh will
Joa be adorned with eleetrie lights every thirty feet, making it very
, light and attractive at night. Under the third outlook it is mbo tended to have sanitary for men whieh will be entirely out| side the park proper. We believe that when all our plans are

completed this one will be the most attractive of all the parks.
ELMWOOD PARK.

Little has been done at this park towards deveigpment owine to delays regarding further additiens: the overflow has
been made for the Jarge pond, and the readway is gradually
being fermed, but not mueh mere ean be dene until future extension to the culvert is made.

HAMPDEN PARK.
This park has about reached its limit for any further im! provements except In several minor ways. Some new walks
will be put in and water cooler and fountain will be added;
outside of these about all is done, excepting to keep the park
up to its high state of efficiency as at present.
CANONCIITET PARK.

With the completion of the stone entrances and new walks
together with the placing of new water cooler and fountam,
about completes all the provements that ean be made. What
Is Wanted more than anything else is eurbing and walks around
the outside of the park.

HAMILTON AND GERMANTIA.

As these parks are so very stall there is not much chance

for nnprovements. The opening of the new Riverside Park

REPORT OF THE PARK COMMISSIONERS  
we hope will relieve their crowded condition. New curbing
is needed badly at both of these parks. At Germania Park
a very pretty fountain has been placed which adds much
to the attractiveness. With the discontinuing of the well
water at this park, ordered by the State Board of Health,
some provision will have to be made to provide suitable drinking water for the people who have depended so long on this
souree for their supply.

RECOMMENDATIONS.

Owing to new condition of things which has arisen
in relation to emplcvment of labor on our parks, the cost of
maintenance has been largely increased so that for this year we
must ask fer nearly double to cover labor items, saine as last
vear.

Now that we have started on the construction of the Parapet wall on Prospeet Park, it is advisable that it be completed
this coming year. With additicn of Riverside Park to our system it will require extra for the care and maintenance and provisions should be made for it, and we recommend that development of same should be started the coming year.

It is of the utmest importanee that lands be secured for
park purpeses while available to be developed in later years,
and we believe it to be the part of wisdom for the city to make
provisions for such purposes as early as possible; inasmuch as
the coming generations are the ones who will largely profit by
such additions they should share part of the burden of such
purchases. For that reason we recommend that serial bond
issue be made for such purpose.

Elmwood Park  now ready for the development work as
soon as necessary funds are given us for same, and also for purchase of additional lands adjoiming which are ineluded in the
general scheme of development for this park. It is very essential that the culvert should be extended West this vear, as
nothing can be dene with development work until the extension  made. Should it be deemed advisable by vour board

For development Riverside Park,

REPORT OF
BOARD OF HEALTH.
To the Honorable, the Mayor,-and the Board of Aldermen:

GENTLEMEN: In compliance with the Public Statutes,
the Board of Health herewith submit for vour consideration
the twenty-fifth amnual report.

The Board met for organization on the first Monday of
February, electing the following offieers: Chairman, Dr.
Arthur B. Wetherell; secretary, Dr. Frank A. Woods; health
officer, Jeremiah J. Linehan.

GENERAL WORK.

In presenting the twenty-fifth annual report the Board
is pleased to state that the general publie health and the sanitation of the city is in satisfactory condition. This favorable
state of affairs has been brought about gradually by constant
attention during the past few vears to all nuisances, sources
of filth and causes of infection. There exists today very
general desire on the part of the people of the city to comply
with the rues of the Board and the state laws relating to the
same.

The mortality is low for city with vamed manufacturing

interests and one containing large tenement districts, and
diseases of contawious nature have not been excessive. A
eontamious disease hospital would greatly facilitate the work.

Many of the old and dilapidated buildings about the city
have been removed, thus eliminating foer of contagion and
filth.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH

The passage through our eity of the sewage laden canal
water is constant menace to the general health of our people
and we hope in the near future to see our canals relieved
of this objectionable feature.

BAKERIES.

Reeular inspections of the bakeries and their surroundings have been made at intervals by the entire board. and
such special inspections as have been required, have been made
by the Board’s inspectors. The general condition of these
manufactories of food products is at present very satisfactory.
During the vear three bakeries were closed until the conditions
existing had been improved to comply with the orders of the
Board. Four new bakeries have been established in the eity
during the year, there bemy at present thirty-two bakeries
In Operation.

BACTERIOLOGY.

The Board has eontinued the system of bactenolocical
examinations mn all eases of diphtheria or throat trouble of a
suspicions nature with very satisfactory results. Of eultures examined it was found that were negative thus saving
expense, danger and annoyance in quarantining many people.

The Board would request each physician to exereise care

- and promptness in taking swabs for diagnosis and. release.
In all eases when the clinical syinptoms indicate diphtheria
and the swab taken is returned negative, second swab for
diagnosis should be taken on the following day. Two consecutive negative swabs are the smallest number that should be
relied upon as an evidence that danger of contagion  passed

Im Cause.

The Board desires, as soon as arrangements can be made,
to furnish an opportunity for the examination of sputa in
all suspected cases of tuberculosis.

Appended is the report of the Bacteriologist.

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH  
UNDERTAKERS. ,

Thirteen licenscs have been granted to engage in this
business during the vear. The undertakers continue to be
prompt in filing the certificates of death, and are careful in
making their returns.

SLAUGHTER HOUSES.

All manufacturers of sausage and prepared meat within
the city have been granted licenses by this Board. Ten licenses
have been granted for the manufacture of sausage, prepared
meat and slaughtering.

, Le;

rhe supervision of these places of business has caused an
improvement in the character of the articles furnished to the
public for consumption.

BARBER SHOPS.

The Board ean state that all barber shops are doing work
In accordance to the rules and reeulations and there have
been no complaints. Two general inspections of barber shops
have been made during the vear and the same were found
provided with running hot and cold water and in good sanitary condition. There are at present sixty barber shops doing
business in the city, ten have been closed during the year.

FRUIT AND VEGETABLES.

We are pleased to state that there is no cause for eomplaint with local dealers and the city is practically free from
the sale of decayed fruit and vegetables.

INSPECTOR OF MILK, VINEGAR, AND PETROLEUM.

When the great consumption of milk is taken into consideration the importance of the work of this department cannot
be lightly estimated and the Board is pleased to report that

the duties of the office are performed in most satisfactory

|
|
  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH
manner. The general quality of milk is up to the standard,
There have been few complaints, and prosecutions have been
made only when absolutely necessary.

The bills of the Milk Department continue to draw heavily
from the finances of this Board as no extra appropriation was
made to meet this expense.

The report of the Milk Inspector is appended.

BARNS AND LIVERY STABLES.

Applications for the erection and oceupaney of buildings
to be used as barns have in all cases received the consideration
of the Board. The premises have been viewed and the requirements of the Jaw enforced. Fifteen applications have been
received during the year and permits have been granted in
most eases. Owing to unfavorable conditions, four applicants
for barn licenses were given leave to withdraw. We would
report that the barns in the vity are ina good general condition

at the present time.
BOARD OF PLUMBING EXAMINERS.

The examination and licensing of plumbers as required by
the laws of the Commonwealth, has been performed by the
Board according to the provisions of the act. There have been
no exmninations for master: but two for Journeyman plumbers.

The report of the Plumbing Examiners is appended.

DEPARTMENT OF PLUMBING AND SANITARY

INSPECTION.

The iuerease in the work of this department  an indication of the general prosperity and rapid erowth of the city.
The unusnal amount of new work with corresponding  nerease for alterations and repairs, marks an era in the work
of the department.

The weneral publie appreciate aud take advantage of the

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH  
benefits of sanitary inspection and large part of the Inspector’s time is taken up with nuisances pertaining to poor or
imperfect plumbing.

The recent epidemies of contagious and infectious diseases
in various sections of the Commonwealth would indicate that
some attention should be paid to our recommendations of
former years regarding house to house inspection of plumbing and the Board would again recommend that special
appropriation be made and the work commenced early in the
year.

The report of the Inspector of Plumbing is appended.

VAULTS AND CESSPOOLS.

The completion of the Highlands and Ingleside sewers has
enabled the Board to abate the nuisances formerly existing In
these loealities and the city is practically free from vaults
and cesspools, as the use of same have been eondemned whereever sewer privileges have allowed.

SEWERS AND DRAINS.

The reports of the State Board's analysis of water taken
from wells in different parts of the city shows that the water
from these wells contains more or less pollution and their use
for drinking purposes has been condemned. This would indieate that the soil is contaminated by the larze amount of
sewage discharged into and passing through the canals in their
course through the city. ,

In the opinion of the Board some other disposal of this
sewayve should be made as the use of the canals for sewers is
objectionable from sanitary point of view and menace to
public health. |

. The Board is pleased to state that there is evidence that

the outlet of the Walnut street sewer will be extended below

the dam in the near future and the nuisance from this source
be abated. |

| VITAL STATISTICS.

: The Board presents for consideration the following tables.

, resume of the Vital Statistics for the year ending November. .

— :

 There have been reported during the year deaths and
  stilbiriks, death rate cf per cent per thousand
inhabitants, which, compared with deaths and  stillbirths, death rate of per cent per thousand renorted

! during  shows decrease this year of deaths or more

: than three-fourths of one per cent. There have been deaths
of non-residents in the eity during the vear.

Table as appended shows the comparative number of
deaths, still-births and death rates for the past fifteen years.
It shows that during this period there have been deaths

and still-births in the city, an average of deaths per
yerur with an average death rate of per cent per thousand
population.

Table B‘ presents the number of deaths and still-births
occurring each month of the year, showing an average of  

. deaths month. By referring to the table it will be seen that
the greatest mortality occurred in May and the smallest in
D mber and November, but there has been little variation
from the average number of deaths.

Table shows that of the deaths recorded during the
year  or per cent, were males, and  or per
cent, were females and of the still-births  or per
cent were males and  or per cent, were females. By
referring to the corresponding table for we find that
the ratio is practically the same. ,

Table gives the sex and age, showing that of the  
deaths reported during the year,  or per cent, were
under one year of age, and  or per cent, were under
  vears of age. Sixty-nine, or per cent, died between the
aves of and years;  or per cent, between the
aves of and years, and  or per cent, were over
dU years of age.

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH  

Comparing these with those recorded for  we find
that there have been during  nineteen less deaths under
one year of age; more deaths under years of age; more
deaths from to years of age; less deaths from to  
years of age, and less deaths over years of age.

It  also interesting to note that of those under one year
of ave, were males and were females; of those under  
years of age, were males and females and of those over
  years of age were males and females. There have
been deaths this year of persons over years of age, as
compared with last year.

Table presents the number of deaths occurring at the
various ages in the several months and is interesting as showing the time of the year when the greatest mortality occurs
at the different periods of life.

Table presents the various causes of death reported
during the year, with the number from each cause. We find
a decrease in the number of deaths from tuberculosis, there
having been  as compared with during  There
have been deaths from cancer as compared with during
the preceding year.

In the various other divisions of causes we find very little
variation from the past two or three years.

Table gives the number of deaths occurring in each of
the institutions of the city and also the number of those
occurring in each ward. This gives an idea of the portion of
the city in which the greatest mortality is found. As for the
past few years wards and respectively have the greatest
mortality.

One hundred and seventy-six or per cent of
the total deaths occurred in the institutions of the city.
Thirty-two or about per cent of those dying were nonresidents.

SCARLET FEVER.

Searlet fever has been evident throughout the year with
the exception of September and November. It has been
reported from every ward in the city, but Ward has had onehalf of the cases. There have been no deaths from this disease.

MEASLES.

Three hundred and fifty-one eases of measles have been
reported with three deaths, death rate of  per cent. The

TYPHOID FEVER.

There has been reported during the year eleven cases of
typhoid fever with four deaths. These cases have been present
in eight of the twelve months and have been scattered throughout the eity.

- CONTAGIOUS DISEASE HOSPITAL.
The Board would once again eall attenticn to the imperative need of hospital for the care of diseases of contagious
nature, especially diphtheria and scarlet fever. The value of
such institutions  being realized more and more each year and
many cities of the state now have such accommodations which
greatly aid in the control of epidemics of such diseases. With
our large tenement districts, it  evident that we should have
such building at our command in the city.
HILLSIDE HOSPITAL.

fairly satisfactory as well as secluded place of confinement

for persons suffering with smallpox, but the former recommendations of this Board for improvements should receive
immediate attention. bath room suitably connected with a

dressing and disinfecting room should be installed so that a

patient may leave the hospital free from contagion from infected wards.

A proper disposal of the sewage should be made as in the
opinion of the Board there is grave danger of the pollution
of the water of the surrounding country in the present condition which is positively dangerous when the house is occupied
with smallpox patients.

Report of the Health Officer.
To the Board of Health:

GENTLEMEN: IT hereby submit report of your Health
Officer for year ending  .) During the past year the number
of minor nuisances, such as dirty cellars, tenements and yards
has decreased, also Jess amount of food product was de- )
stroved. This in itself is an indication that the people of our
city recognize the importance of sanitary surroundings and the
relation they bear to the pubhte health.

The maumber of old buildings still continues to deerease :
the number removed durme the past vear beme nine with
action pending on four.

[am happy to state that the improvement noted in my
last report in regard to the sale of decayed fruit and vegetables
and produce still continues. At the present time no fault can
be found with any of these articles for wholesale or retail in
the city and in only two cases was it found necessary to order
woods removed from unsanitary premuses,

Four places used for the manufacture of ice cream were
ordered closed owing to the unsanitary condition of the
premises, three of which places have comphed with the requirements of the Board, one remaining losed.

On orders of the Board, water was drawn from two ponds
In West Holvoke from which places ice is harvested, and same
thoroughly cleaned and are now in first class condition,

Other duties performed by vour officer are sufficiently set
forth in the accompanying tables. Several verbal and minor
complaints have been atiended to which were not of sufficient
Inportance to be entered upon the records,

All eases have comphed with the requirements of the
Board.

The unusual amount of new work during the past vear
shows the rapid growth of the work of this department and in |

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH  
conjunction with the examinations of imperfect plumbing and
nuisances pertaining to same, places the department work in
its entirety on much larger comparative scale than in most
cities of this size. |

I am pleased to state the completion of the Ingleside and
Highland sewers has enabled this department to abate the
nuisances formerly existing in these localities.

Two general inspections of Barber shops have been made
during the year and in most cases they have been found to
meet the requirements of the Board. Five warnings of minor
offenses were sent to owners of these shops and am pleased to
state that all shops at the present time are in good sanitary

: condition.

The recent epidemics of contagious and infectious diseases
in certain sections of the Commonwealth would indicate that
some attention should be given to my recommendation of 
former years as regards house to house inspection of plumbing.

I would again eall attention to the sanitary condition of
Hillside Hospital. fumigating and bath room should be
installed for the use of convalescent patients and proper
disposal made of the sewage. The continued use of the privy
vault in its present location is to be condemned, and in the
opinion of the writer there is grave danger of the pollution
of the water of the surrounding country by the present general
sanitary conditions, which are positively dangerous when the
house is occupied by smallpox patients.

In conclusion desire to thank the members of the Board
for their courtesy and co-operation.

Respectfully submitted, |
F.L. AVERY,
Inspector of Plumbing.

MILK.

There have been ten prosecutions this year, all for selling
milk of not good standard quality. Three parties were fined
$  each, six were fined  each, and one .

All these paid their fines except one, who appealed to the
Superior Court on the grounds that the milk was not sold.

I have sent out warnings and all but the ones that have
been fined, have paid attention to them and these escaped
prosecution.

A sample of milk brought to me for examination appeared
to be milk taken from cow too soon after calving. Upon.
investization this proved to be the fact.

The way milk is brought me for test or examination is to
say the least, unsatisfactory. In one ease the milk, one-half
ounce, was in dirty medicine bottle: another, about four
ounces, in half-pint flask that was stained with dirt on the
inside and smelled of wintergreen. Of course nothing can be
done with samples of this kind. Bring me all the milk just as
you receive it, in the same container, and as soon as possible
after you get it, then can test it.

The license of one peddler was revoked by order of the
Board of Health, for having dirty wagon, and was renewed
only after he had obtained another wagon that was acceptable.
Almost all the wagons are in good condition, but few are not
in good shape. }

The wooden plug does not come to Holyoke any more. I
have been able to find but three in the past year.

I have been with Health Officer Linehan few times, and
he has helped me several times.

The Babeock tester operated by electric power has been in
use now for over vear, and enables me to do more and better
work than IT eould with the old hand machine.

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH  
| VINEGAR.

I have tested samples of vinegar and found them all
up to the standard, except two that were brought in by dealers
who wished them tested before they bought.

OLEOMARGARINE.

I have issued but two licenses for oleomargarine, one for

a store and one for peddler.
BUTTER.

One party was fined for selling renovated butter, not being
properly marked. This party was prosecuted by State Agent
Harwood. In March found renovated butter in tubs from
which the revenue stamps had been removed, in seven stores.
These cases turned over to KE. L. Kirtland, Deputy Collector.

PETROLEUM.

I have tested samples from tank cars and found them
all lawful oil. There has been no attempt to send poor into
the city this year, as has been the case almost every year of
late. ;

I have had great assistance from the Health Officer and
the Board of Health, also from my Collector of Samples.

I thank the City Marshal and the patrolmen for the help
they have given me.

Respectfully submitted,
JAMES K. MORRILL,
Inspector of Milk and Vinegar.

Report of Bacteriologist.
To the Board of Health, City of Holyoke, Mass.:

GENTLEMEN: have the honor to submit the following
report for the year ending November .

There have been referred to me during the past year
cultures from the throat or nose of persons, to determine
the presence or absence of diphtheria bacilli. total of  
cultures have been examined from these cases. The work
of the year shows an increase of in the number of cases
examined, and an increase of in the number of cultures
made and examined.

Diphtheria was somewhat more prevalent throughout the
past year than during  more positive cases being reported
for each month of the year except in March, April, and November. The number of eases for diagnosis showing diphtheria
bacilli was  and cases were negative on the diagnostic
culture. Thirty-five eases were submitted for release only, and
of these showed diphtheria germs and did not show
them.

A noteworthy fact to be mentioned in connection with the
year’s work  the very high percentage of positive cases which
have been released only upon the finding of negative eulture.
There has been steady improvement in this line from year to
vear, and during practically all positive eases have been
so treated. It seems to me that this praetice cannot but tend
to prevent the spread of the disease. Numerous positive eultures have been taken before release negative could be
obtained in very many cases, and in one case cultures in all
were made.

Below will be found the monthly record of work.

REPORT OF THE
SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

To His Honor, the Mayor, and the Citizens of Holyoke:

The School Board, through its sub-committee, offers this,
ifs annual report for the year  .

As the duties of the Sehool Board are to attend to the services to be rendered the schools, to look after the physical
equipment of the schools and see that the same has been provided for financially, so in this report we will speak cf the eonditions involved in these departments. To note the results
and to suggest betterments, your committee therefere offers
the following:

Some of the duties are pleasant; ethers, no matter how
impartially the school committeemen may act, have unpleasant
sides. Yet the beard feels that it has been faithful to the duties intrusted to it and that all ef its members have united in
the perfermance of their duties for the general good of the
city.

The school force is now ina eondition of distinet improvement, the physieal equipment is being enlarged and more
adapted to the needs ef our growing city, and all of this has
been brought about ina properly economical way. healthy
growth marks the school census of Holyoke. Starting with an
inereased number of pupils of one hundred and cighty-twe
the first of the year, that increase has constantly grown.

Some changes have urred during the year, the prineipal one being that of the superintendent.

The committee on attendanee, census and truaney reeommended, and the board thought wise to elect third truant

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE  
officer. The inereased corps your committee believes will be
able to diminish the truaney in our schools very materially, 
and such services will, we believe, more than compensate the
city for the small inereased expense. If number of truants ,
shall be kept away from the truancy school and not tainted
with anv criminal stain we believe that the benefit given to
their young lives and their usefulness as eitizens will be money
well spent for the higher hfe of themselves and for the inereased welfare of our city.
Our High School corps has been increased, and your committee believes that it could be further inereascd for the benefit of the city by the reopening of the department of domestie
science. All of the apparatus and equipment necessary for
this department is now on hand; the only inereased cost would
he that of the teacher.
The ecommereial department had so grown that it became
necessary to appoint an additional teacher to that department,
so that we are now eapable of properly handling the inereased
demand for commercial work. This age seems to be business
age and the commercial work as evidenced in our TTigh Sehool
grows faster than many other departments.
The quantity of clerical work that had been done by the
prineipal of our Tigh School grew to such size that if would
occupy the greater part of the prineipal’s time. The committee, therefore, deemed it wise to select elerk whose chief
funetion is to reheve the prineipal from elerieal work and enable him to perform the more advanced duties which his position demand.
As the needs of the section about the South Chestnut
Street School seemed to require the establishment of kindervarten, the committee has opened cne for the accommodation
of that neighborhood.
A new building, structure that promises well for the
South Holyoke educational center, is in the course of construetion. Its need was imperative. Four outside rooms are being
used, and they are not such quarters as the committee believes

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE |

would be best for the pupils. They are, however, the best
available, and the new building will give relief to the teach- |
ers and pupils and materially diminish thé expenses of that

school district.

While much has been done, there are many things yet to
be done. The most prominent need that has impressed itself
upon the committee is the need of complete new modern
school to take the place of the oft-repaired, decrepit building
now doing service at North Chestnut street. Here is structure representing neither the size of the building required nor
a reasonably healthful sanitary condition. It is impossible to
give the proper ventilation to its rooms or any other healthful
condition that ought to obtain and be greatest in our school
life. There are two outside rooms hired in this district, the
cost and maintenance of which would be great help toward
the construction of the much needed school quarters here. A
fence is much needed in the rear of this building to prevent
vagrants and others from using that as common passageway
and interfering with school pupils and school work.

In the High School, reoms  and should have the
full quota of desks, twenty-nine in each, to accommodate the
growing needs.

A simple closet should be constructed on the first floor to
be used for the storage of janitor’s implements.

The elock system should be inspected and new storage
batteries supplied.

Under room there should be some sheathing to prevent the coming through of coal dust into that room; and outer
dvors should be placed upon the three entrances as the needs
during certain seasons are very obvious..

In the Appleton Street School the sanitaries are insufficient te accommodate themselves to the needs of the pupils,
and this could be overcome very easily by extending the walls
of the present sanitaries one story higher and placing sanitaries therein. This seems to have been anticipated when the
others were plaeed there since the plumbing seems to have been
done with that end in view.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE  

Here, too, the old rusty drinking cup is in vogue. This
condition here should be eliminated, as well as wherever it exists. The habit of drinking water from those unhealthy vessels should be stamped out and followed by the more hygienie
drinking fountain.

One important need of the Elmwood School is new hall.
Pupils have no place in which to assemble, nor have their parents any place in which the general exercises of the school
children can be properly heard. Either two rooms should be
converted into limited hall, or some provision should be made
in the unused school to allow the pupils to properly gather together within hall. The first seems preferable as school
children ought not to be compelled, especially in inclement
weather, to leave their own building and go to another.

Many of the seats within this building should be re-varnished. It would greatly add to the neatness and attractiveness of the building; and the hallways should be re-tinted.

In the West Street School one thing demands attention.
The boys’ sanitaries are not only poor, they are constant
menace to the health of the boys as well as to the health of the
school. New sanitaries should positively be substituted for the
present dangerous ones, and the ventilation increased. Much
of the rest of the building should be re-tinted.

In the Highland School, once more we reiterate the request made to remove the gas engine. The vibration going
through the building when this engine is in use is direct interference with the school work.

The South Chestnut Street School is over-crowded, one
class being compelled to go to the High School and another
class to an outside building in that district. Without any material outlay building of four or eight rooms could be constructed in the South Chestnut Street School district and
thus ample provisions made to meet the demands of that neighborhood.

In this building the Board of Public Works could do
much benefit by repairing the windows; the gutters and waste
pipe, too, need immediate attention..

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE
At Springdale sterm door would greatly benefit the pupils during the winter. The walls in this building should be |
brightened and much of the furniture therein should be varnished and made mere attractive. |
At Park Street there should be new furniture for rooms
  and  the present furniture is not of such size as should
be used in grades one and two, it is too large and its usage
would have bad effeet upon the pupils.
The blaekboards should be painted throughout the build. ing, the eeiling repaired. and permanent wall should be
placed between rcems and instead ef the present sounding
board between. the same. An ircn fenee should be placed
around the building, and if pessible stone wall at the rear of
the building.
At West Holyoke there is prenouneed need of new
souree of supply for drinking water. The children are eompelled to go leng distanee to well, which well seems exposed
to the drainage from barnyards. This seems to your comnnittee
such menace to health as would require its rapid removal
and the construction of well in quarter not exposed to any
sueh danver.
The numbers in the Elin Street Sehool are growing and
the rooms now being used by the Sehool Department are
needed for the school purposes, and larger and greater quarters more suitable to the needs of the superintendent, the office
eorps.and the beard are required. Sueh building could be
properly built upen the lot now owned by the eity south of the
Elin Street building.
It is recommended that His Honor, the Mayor, petition the
Legislature to change the law relating to the taking of the
sehcel census so that the truant officers will. be permitted to
take this census during the vacation period. The economy of
this suggestion is apparent. ,
; The evening schoel committee has put into reality the desire to make our evening schools the best. possible, and in domg
this determined that while there were trained teachers

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE  
who were willing to undertake the evening school work no
others should be allowed to do this important work, and until
the hst of candidates of trained teachers was exhausted no
others were considered.

Through the committee on printing and supplies an inventcry of all the supplies eonnected with our school system
has been made, with the purpose of aseertaining our sehool
assets and using this information as basis for future needs.

This ecmmittee, tceo, has exereised rigid care in the expenditure cf the schcol appropriation, has met regularly, and
is ina great measure responsible for the sound economy of the .
department, accentuated by the fact, that although the appro- .
‘priation was decreased materially, the beard has nevertheless lived within its appropriation; and while much money has
been granted by your Honor and the citizens of Holyoke, the
rapid growth in the number of pupils, the importanee cf the
sechcel to the ecivie life, the increased ecst of school eommodities, and the urgent need for large inerease in our facilities,
together with the desire to seeure such quantity of books,
supplies, and such teachers as will keep our schools in touch
with modern life. all these things demand that the coming
year will see our appropriation enlarged.

, Respectfully yours, |

REPORT OF THE
Superintendent and Secretary.
To the School Committee of Holyoke:
GENTLEMEN: have the honor to offer for your consider‘ation the forty-sond annual report of the superintendent of
schools.
The department over which you preside should be work
full of high purpose, should contain methods, principles and
processes that tend to develop real character; it is the ground
. work of true civie life.
SCHOOL BUILDINGS.
The activities of our department during the year have
shown themselves in many marked ways.
In Ward One the East Dwight Street building was giving unsatisfactory service because of improper heating. The
pupils were transferred to the Bridge Street School, whose
equipment besides costing much less than the proper equipment would have ecst for the East Dwight Street building
ives much more satisfaction, especially in its sanitation.
The inadequacy of school rooms in the South Holyoke district was more pronounced during the present school year,
since it beeame necessary to open two new outbuildings in that
district for the overflow. This increase leaves that district
with five out-rooms at the present time. An attic, too, is in
improper use at the Hamilton Street School building. Whatever preparation or care is exerciscd in making the most of
those outer rooms, it  still impossible to so arrange them that
they will in proper measure approach the real school room

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE  
for air, light or health. Fortunately these present conditions
promise to be brought to an end before the expiration of the
year  when the sixteen room modern building now under
construction in that district ought to be in full operation.

Another portion of the city in which the numbers are constantly growing is the South Chestnut Street School district. There is here at the present writing one tenement doing service for school room, together with an attic room in
the building, also one class properly belonging to the South
Chestnut Street School utilizing one of the High School rooms;
and while no serious conflict arises in this use, it would be far
better to have these outer rcoms part of the South Chestnut
Street School proper. An addition to that building suggests
itself as the mcst expedient means for relief of the situation.

In the North Chestnut Street district the annual announcement is at hand, that the school building at North
Chestnut Street is physically unfit for school service. This
long used structure has become menace to the children’s

health on account of poor ventilation, absence of hallways, bad
light and unfit sanitaries. To recommend repairs upon this
building would seem to be mistake for it has gone beyond the
stage of repairs, and into that stage where its complete anni. hnlation is the only thing that would meet the situation; and
while it is more strictly within the province of your committee to make such recommendation, your superintendent has
noted not only the facts above mentioned of the condition of
the building, but also the figures which prove that the per
capita running expenses of such building exd by far the
per capita running expenses of better equipped building;
and the building, too, retards greater educational results.

The issue is raised in other quarters whether structures
shall be erected to accommodate the pupils or whether they
shall be transported on the street cars or by other conveyances
to make complete use of the buildings that are already lighted,
heated and ventilated. Wherever the distances are not too
great and the modes of transportation are convenient, it would

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE
be well in view of the growing population of our city, and the
changed conditions that might arise, to use such facilities for
transportaticn rather than to erect buildings which will ere
long be empty. oo
: PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. |

Lceal eonditicns here bring out as strongly as in aly city
the relationship between the publie and parochial schools.
During this sehccl year bond cf comity has been observed
between these two instituticns. It seems almest hke an unknow fact that the state takes cognizanees of parochial schools
only inasmuch as their curriculum receives the approval and
sanction of the city’s schoel. board. |

One serious impediment to edueaticn in both of these
schools was the constant shifting of pupils from the parechial
to the public or vice versa. This was done often at the eaprice
of the pupil whese grievance at either institution often was
Imaginary, and the sehcel werk cf the pupil, as well as the
work of the class into which the pupil was placed, was interrupted to the less of both. This matter has been brought to
an end by the complete understanding that during the school
term changes from one school to another would not be allowed.

EVENING SCIIOOLS. 

Never before was the need of an evening school zreater
than that of the present time, for the child labor law providing fer the welfare of children makes it’ impessible in our
commonwealth that any child under the ave of sixteen years
shall be permited to work unless he has an ability to actually
read and write. The necessity of the evening sehool to a
varied population whese knowledge ef English is so Jimited
Is then at the present time mest obvious. and the children emploved in the different manufacturing and mereantile establishments, realizing this, are attending the evening school more
and mere.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE  movement of much importance in our evening schools
was adcepted and put into execution during the current school
year, which rule provided that as long as there were normal
schce] graduates appheants fer pesitions in our evening schools
no other applieaticn would be considered, and the committee
exhausted the lst of normal school applicants before any other
applicaticns were even eonsidered; so that the teaching corps
of our evening schools has been improved much during the
present sehcel year.

Our evening High School, too, has taken step forward
from its experimental stage and become valuable and much
appreciated institution of learning fer these net so fortunate
as to be able to enjoy our day High School. The eurrieulum
is eompesed of chemistry, physics, bookkeeping, typewriting,
shorthand, advaneed Enelish, the medern langitazes, algebra,
Latin and mechanical drawing, and wherever sufficient nuin) ber of earnest students show continued desire for any other
of the day High School advanced studies, provision is made
so that the eourse In our evening sehool ean be adapted to
mect this need.

COURSE OF STUDY.

A modern eourse of study compiled as working basis ,
to guide our local teachers is thing much needed, and to get
a complete one under way is work of no small magnitude.
This should operate as general outhine. It should not be so
stringent as to destroy the originahty of the teaeher, should
be expansive enough to be adapted to the needs of the pupils
in the different localities, should show maximum and minimuni of work to be done, should allow great latitude on the
part cf the teacher, but all of the works accomplished ought to
be in measure uniform, capable of being tested, and where a
weakness exists such weakness ought to be exposed, for no
teacher can do her full duty unless she understands not only
her studies, but the particular object of given study. An
outline of the description stated could be referred to as guide
and help, as something to let the teacher understand what

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE

the pupil coming to her is supposed to know, as well as what

the pupil going from her room is supposed to know. brief

outline of course of study is now under way.
TEACHING.

One aspect of our school system merits unusual attention,
the surplus of normal school graduates that are upon our waiting list. Almost all are teachers who have in addition to their
normal school course served an apprenticeship as teachers in
various towns throughout the commonwealth. Some of these
are the sole earning power of their families. The question
now arises, what method in the selection of these teachers to do
service in our school system is the best for our city’s welfare?
Shall we select giving precedence to those who were graduated
from the normal school at an earlier period than the others;
shall we select on basis of work done in the normal school and
in the apprenticeships; or shall we select them by means of an
examination held, in which the principals of the different
buildings and the superintendent would be judges’?

To adopt the idea involved in the first question would
mean on investigation that the poorest of the preceding class
must take her place in the school work before the best of the
subsequent class, and therefore the city’s interest would not be
subserved. To select on the basis of work done in the normal
school and apprenticeship would be bringing number of
elements difficult of solution into the determination, some of ;
these elements oftentimes impossible of determination. The
third way, having an examination, while it is by no means a
perfect solution, and while number of elements must be taken
into consideration, seems to be the best known solution. It is
certainly true that large number of effective teachers would
then at least have some definite criterion to determine their
appointment. .

Our active teaching force throughout the city consists of
eighteen male and one hundred and seventy-seven female teachers. To speak indiscriminately and say that all are giving exREPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE 
cellent service would be scarcely doing justice to many, but the
vast majority of our teachers are men and women devoted to
their work, exemplary in their character; they bring into the
school room an atmosphere that must resuit in pupils healthier
both mentally and physically. Perhaps the force of these teach: ers in our city would be increased by each of the principals organizing into body whose work would be the advanced study
of teaching. The coming into contact with the different other
teachers in the building, the study that would be required to
take an active part in the discussions at these meetings, the
spirit that would be awakened along educational lines, and
the more intimate knowledge of the pupil’s capacity, would
increase, it seems to me, the efficiency of the different schools.

Another force that might be used to bring betterment to
our city’s educational work would be the ‘‘ Teachers’ Organization.’’ This is an institution devoted to and accomplishing
much for the happier understanding between the teachers. Its
objects are very worthy, but could they not be enlarged and
made more effective as an intellectual agency for the welfare
of our schools? There is at the present time wealth of hterature devoted to the school work. Discussions upon the
merits of these works, lectures or essays from the different
members or others relating to the most effective results in their
particular schools, and comparison of these means with the
well known edueational principles, would seem to come within
the province of the Teachers’ Association. It could in this
way have much to do with enlarging the foree of the teacher
In our municipality.

I commend for your eareful reading the reports of the
principal of our high school, of our evening high and grammar schools, and the supervisors of drawing, writing and
niusiec.

Respectfully yours,
JAMES J. DONNELIE.

REPORT OF THE
Supervisor of Drawing.
Mr. James J. O’Donnell, Superintendent of Schools:

Dear Sir: No radical changes have been made in the
department of drawing during the past year.

It has always been the aim of the supervisor tu be progressive in conservative way, tc be reasonably sure before
making change of any kind that the proposed change in
methcd or in subjeet matter would really be an improvement;
eonsequently there has seldom been oceasion to regret the
course taken, although it is certainly true that supervisor
needs to plan very carefully eourse in drawing that on one
hand shall avoid the sheals of alluring fads and felhes and
con the other hand shall steer clear of the quicksands of cut
and dried methods that will utterly destroy the pupils’ interest
and enthusiasm.

It is clearly large part of supervisor’s duty to place
each problem as it comes up in night relation to the main purpose which underlies the whole subject, in order that pupils
may be given an all round training whieh will become part
of their own lives and fit them, as far as possible, to beeome
intelligent and valuable eitizens.

A brief explanation of the work that we attempt to do in
our course In drawing was given in the sehool report of last
vear, and we are still working at similar problems.

An attempt has been made to sunplify the eourse as much
as possible, to give as much consecutive time as we ean to obJect drawing and to secure as much time as possible to work
out different problems in design.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE  

As the years go by it becomes more and more evident that
the subject of design is vital question. Schools of design are
springing up all over the country and interest in the subject
is everywhere being awakened. As some one has remarked,
‘‘Design is in the air,’’ and intelligent study along this line
may mean much for the country as well as for the individual,
for there is no greater need in the industrial world than that
for skilled designers; while as regards the individual pupil,
there is nothing in the whole school curriculum that aifords a
better opportunity than the study cf design for the development of individuality and creative ability, or for enabling the
pupil to realize what President Elict says is the new motive of
cur edueation, ‘The mcetive of joy through achievement. ’’

An endeavcr is made to eonnect the lessons assigned,
whenever it is pcssible, with the needs and interests of the
pupils. For instanee, near the elcse ef the last school year,
the time appreached for eolleeting the results of the year’s
work in drawing, eover for the papers seemed desirable.
Ilere was an cpportunity for lessen in design that would
meet an aetual want, and aecordingly every pupil in the intermediate and grammar grades was asked to make an original
design for cover or portfoho for his own drawings.

There was much studying of magazines and other covers by
the older pupils, and much interest manifested In many ways,
and finally some exdingly good covers and portfolios were
made, much better in design than would have been the ease if
they had not been made for speeifie purpose.

The timeliness of any partieular lesson has much to do also
in awakening interest. Pupils will struggle much more cheerfully with the difficulties of good lettering when it is to be ap, plied to some special Thanksgiving, Christmas or Easter work
than would be the ease under other ecireumstanees. ‘* Interest
in the product should be the cause of interest in the process.’’

All of these points and many others must be taken into
consideration in planning course of study by means of which
pupils shall be trained to the best advantage as far as lies
within our power.

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE |

The intermediate and grammar schools are visited by the
supervisors once in every two weeks, the other lessons being
given by the regular teachers.

Teacher’s meetings have been held regularly throughout
the year and the attendance, with few exceptions, has been exeellent. It seems especially important that all teachers of
Grades and II should be present at their grade meetings to
receive directions as there is no other opportunity for them to
do so. \

Many of the classes in the High School are larger than ]

usual, not so much because of larger number of pupils as
because many of them are devoting more time than usual to \
the subject. While this is gratifying as denoting increased in’ when the time appreached for collecting the results of the
terest, it makes some of the classes so large that there is little 
time for the individual criticism that becomes necessary where
every pupil is working out his own problems.

Notwithstanding this disadvantage, however, we have had
eonfirmation several times during the last year that the work
accomplished in our High Sehool compares favorably with
that done in other places, as several prizes were awarded to
pupils in our school, in competitions that received responses
from High Schools all over the country.

Reports ived from our pupils who have entered higher
institutions have also been very encouraging.

While it is pleasant to acknowledge this much of success—suecess attained should prove only an incentive to pupils
and teachers to strive for further advanee.

Tn conelusion wish to express my appreciation of the
intellhgent and cordial co-operation of the prineipals and teachers, and of the interest and consideration shown by the Superintendent and members of the Sehool Board.

Respect fully submitted,
ISABELLE H. FERRY.

REPORT OF THE
Supervisor of Wniting.
Mr. James J. O'Donnell, Superintendent of Schools:

Dear Sir: The department of writing, during the past
year, has been carried on upon the same lines as the preceding one, the medium slant system of penmanship being used.
Besides the regular book work, have prepared special line
of copy work for the various grades and introduced many oriwinal exercises. This renders the subject more interesting.
Special stress has been laid upon securing good results in composition, language and spelling, with the result of marked
improvement in this direction. At regular intervals samples
are prepared so the improvement of each pupil may be noted.
A feature of the year’s work which has been the cause of gratification was the enthusiastic co-operation of the teachers with
me in making this department one of the best in our schools.
With thanks for the courtesy and consideration afforded me,

Very truly yours,
ESTHER A. MacDONNELUE.

REPORT OF THE
Supervisor of Music.
Mr. James J. O'Donnell, Superintendent of Schools:

Dear Str:—There has been no change of importanee during the past year in the music course as taught in our sehcols,
but we have tried to emphasize the important phases cf the
work. Although there are several weak spots, as whole we
have made progress. The great drawback to the musie at present in our schools is lack of time.

For several years the State Board of Education has been
interested in the instruetien in musie given in the publie
schools of Massaehusetts. Seme members cf the Board have
felt that music was one of the essentials of education reeognizine that the ability to hear is as universal gift as the
ability to see; and that while training is provided in observatien, it is no less that the sense of hearing should be cultivated.

President Caroline Lazard, cf the State Beard of Edueatien says. *'Threugh the spoken word, by the living voice we

) eome into the closest possible commumoen with our fellows and
when the common elements of sound existing in the world all
about us are raised and glorified by the art of musie, an avenue of life is open whieh knows no end.”’

Especially in matemalistie age does the art of music
became cf great Importance in the providing of food fer the
erowth of that spiritual hfe. without which free ecomimonwealth cannot exist. If this is faet, does it not deserve more
than sixty minutes weekly for study?

The graduation exercises of the grammar schools were
held at the Opera House. The musical program was exeeuted

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE  
in satisfactory manner, giving pleasure to the pupils and
general satisfaction to all present.

At the High School the musie has been advancing steadily. The graduation exercises were well arranged and executed.

The Boys’ Glee Club has been doing good work, singing at the Prize Speaking contest and on several other oceasions to the pleasure of the scholars.

Allow me in conclusion to express my thanks to the principals and teachers, also the School Committee and Superintendent for their hearty co-operation.

Respectfully yours,
IUGH CRAIG.
