MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
Gentlemen of the Board of Aldermen :-—
I take pleasure in thanking the citizens of this municipality
for the confidence they have reposed in me by electing me to the
high office of Mayor. hope by my administration to continue to
merit the approval of the taxpayers.
In we organized our first city council, and for twenty-two
years we lived under the charter adopted in our incorporation. We
prospered, our city increasing in population from to  ,
our valuation increasing in like proportion, and like all successful
business corporations, with an increasing business. ‘The citizens,
who are our stockholders, took new departure by voting in the
year eighteen hundred and ninety-six to adopt new charter recommended by commission composed of some of Holyoke’s most
influential taxpayers, who believed that it was for the city’s best
interest to make achange. They thought that under the new charter
the various departments that were not controlled by commissions
created by the City Council or State Legislature could be simplified
and conducted on more economical basis by placing them under
the control and jurisdiction of the Board of Public Works, body
of administrative officers created by section  title  of the act
to revise the charter. ‘heir duties are defined in section  title
 the same act. The Board of Public Works will speak of
hereafter. The experiment of the new charter, for consider it as
yet an experiment, was put into operation by the City Council of
the year  And it is for you, as the representatives of the
citizens, the custodians of the people’s money, to judge from the

  MAYOR'S ADDRESS. 
reports of the different departments now operating under the new
charter whether or not the revenue of this corporation has been
expended for the best interest of the citizens and taxpayers. hope
you, the members of this year’s council, will carefully examine the
receipts and expenditures of these departments so that you can
vote intelligently on the appropriations. feel it is your duty to
assist me in giving to the citizens of this city an economical ad| ministration, and, in order to do so, you and must be prepared to
' prevent the heads of departments from experimenting with the
city’s money. We must also use our power as legislators to compel
the departments to live within their appropriations. You will find
by studying the financial reports of the different departments that
a majority of them have overdrawn their accounts, which would not
occur if the commissions were to transact the business of their
offices in as conservative spirit as some of them conduct their own
business. The trouble with most of the citizens elected or appointed
to office is that they feel that because the money appropriated for
their departments is public money it can be used for any extravagant purpose, and their only thought is to cater to the whims of
some of their constituents who assisted in putting them into office.
Officers of this municipality should take into consideration that the
wave of business prosperity has not reached our city, and the manufacturers and business men have not recovered from the hard times
of the past four years. And they must not be burdened by heavily
increased rate of taxation caused by extravagant expenditure of
public money by the City Council, which hold responsible for the
extravagance of the government of the year  .
We raised by taxation last year some thirty thousand ($ )
dollars more than we raised in any previous year in the history of
our city, and, instead of defraying our expenses and having surplus in our treasury, we are borrowing money and increasing our
net debt, condition of things which, in my opinion, it is the duty
of your Mayor to avert by means of that close and active supervision
of the conduct of city officials and departments expressly required |
of him by the city charter. ‘This duty shall honestly endeavor to.
perform. |

 it has paid all its running expenses, interest on its bonds,
paid for its construction account, over half million dollars above
the amount borrowed, and placed enough in its sinking fund to
pay for the original loan of besides furnishing water to
the inhabitants of Holyoke at lower rate than any other city in
Massachusetts, with one exception. But considering the large
growth of the city in the last twenty years, and the prospects for its ,
future developments, the Commissioners thought it wise to increase
the supply of water, and in consequence permission was secured
fromthe Legislature of to use the water of the Manhan
River and the Tucker and Manhan Brooks,” and they feel confident that when this is done the water supply of Holyoke will be
second to none in the State, and enough to supply city of

inhabitants, and with only the small debt of less than one-fourth
million dollars.

The stock of the Holyoke and Westfield Railroad, owned by
the city, is worth more than par value; it has paid per cent

Holyoke, with its great water power, during the coming summer to be mide forever safe and secure by stone dam to cost
nearly its numerous manufacturing industries and ra lroad facilities, its magnificent city hall and schoolhouses, its asphalt
paved streets, sewers, parks, bridges, electric railroad, and its industries and enterprising population, may well claim to be one of the
most prosperous cities in the Union.

BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.

The Board of Public Works is creation of the new charter,
for the purpose of controlling the departments of highways and
bridges, city property, sewers and drains, sidewalks, fuel and street
lights, and other departments formerly managed by joint committees of the City Council appointed by the Mayor and the President
of the Board of Common Council. Their report ts voluminous
document without any special features that would be of interest to
the citizens, except their promise that the coming year the various
departments under their supervision can be conducted on more
economical basis. We hope they will see the wisdom of economy,
or the judgment of the taxpayers, who are now groaning under a
heavy burden of taxation caused by the extravagant waste of the
public money by the departments of the city, will be pronounced
against them. We find that the total receipts in all departments
and accounts of which the Board has had control during the year
 is and the total expenditures for the year  
was showing an unexpended balance of |
With overdrafts of  deducted, there would appear to be
a net unexpended balance of But this apparently
excellent result is brought about by including as items in its receipts
the High School and Ward One School appropriations, created by
legislative enactment and acquired by this department from former
administrations. The amount of these two appropriations as received by the Board, was ‘The amount expended
from them was leaving an unexpended balance in these
funds of Deducting this last named amount from
$ the amount claimed by the Board as its net unexpended balance, we find that its actual unexpended balance is only
$ For the ordinary work of their departments this Board
received by appropriation, transfer and otherwise, of
which they expended The report does not indicate
how much of their receipts was by original appropriation and how
much by transfer from other departments. .

 

MAYOR’S ADDRESS. ,
STREET PAVING.

Paving, and the material used in the paving of streets, have
claimed the attention and thought of the road masters and engineers of the country for number of years; and at present it is
conceded by experts that vitrified brick is the cheapest and most
durable, as streets paved with this material are easily repaired at a
small expense and are free from the noise and dust that granite
paving occasions. ‘The Board recommends that the city wait and
see how the Cabot street paving wears before paving more streets
with vitrified brick. The Board asserts that the Holyoke Street
Railway Company refused to pay for the cost of paving eighteen
inches outside the tracks on Cabot street between Main street and
the Willimansett bridge. After conference between the Board of
Public Works and Mr. Loomis, president of the Street Railway, the
Board of Public Works entered into an agreement with Mr. I.comis
that if the Holyoke Street Railway would pay its portion of the cost
of the paving on Cabot street between Main street and the Willimansett bridge, the Board of Public Works would exempt the company from paying like portion of the cost of paving on Cabot
street between Main and High streets, an agreement which think
is not advantageous to the city. say to the Board of Aldermen
that the above condition of affairs, where corporation like the
Holyoke Street Railway obtains its valuable franchises with little if
any restriction, and no cost, is not as it should be. And my advice
is, that if the Holyoke Street Railway is seeking for further privileges, the conditions be such that the city will derive the benefits
it is entitled to for the granting of such privileges.

The net receipts of the department for the year are  ;
the expenditures for the year are .

SIDEWALKS.

Some portions of our city are badly in need of sidewalks and
curbing. The Board of Public Works should see that petitions
from the older and more thickly populated streets for curbing and
sidewalks should be granted in preference to petitions from sparse»

  MAYOR'S ADDRESS.
ly settled districts. The laying of curbing and sidewalks, while
greatly improving the streets, also enhances the value of property.

The receipts for the year were the expenditures,

CITY FORESTER DEPARTMENT.

This department is in charge of D. H. Newton. The receipts

for the year were the expenditures were .
HIGHWAYS AND BRIDGES.

The highways of our city are in excellent condition. Many
streets have been graveled during the year. The recommendation
that wheels of all heavy vehicles should have tires six inches wide
is good one. If adopted, it would be great saving in the wear
and tear of the streets. The washing of our paved streets by water
from the hydrants improves the sanitary condition of the highway
and neighborhood. The iron work of the bridges leading to Willimansett and South Hadley Falls has been repaired and painted.
St. Jerome avenue was opened between Sargeant and Dwight
streets. High street was widened between Fountain and Prospect
streets. ;

The receipts for the year were the expenditures
for the year were .

STREET WATERING.

The watering of our city streets the past year has given general satisfaction. believe that instead of having the drivers make
postal card reports of the number of trips made daily, it would be
more systematic and more economical] for the Board of Public
Works to appoint foreman whose duty it would be to keep the
time and number of trips the drivers make each day.

The receipts for the year were the expenditures

' were .
FUEL AND SfREET LIGHTS.

The Board of Public Works reports that the contract between
the city and the Holyoke Water Power Company for the lighting
of streets and public buildings terminates July and it is
obligatory on the part of the city to make some arrangements

MAYOR'S ADDRESS.  
whereby we can continue to light our streets and buildings until
‘such time as we can establish the municipal lighting plant.

The cost of the electric street lights for the year was .

CITY PROPERTY.

This is department of the city that is under the supervision
of the Inspector of Public Buildings, who has the management of
all improvements and repairs on the buildings and grounds owned
by the city. consider it one of the most expensive departments
of the city, and know, having acted as chairman of the committee while member of the City Government, that great portion
of the expense incurred in this department is brought about by the
too accommodating spirit of the Inspector of Public Buildings, who
will order work done and give employment to people at the request
of some member of the City Government. hope that the
Inspector of Public Buildings will realize this year that the citizens
of this city elected the present government to protect their money,
and that he will see that it is expended judiciously. The amount
of repairing on the various public buildings the past year was enormous, occasioning large outlay of money.

The receipts of the department were  the expenditures for the year were .

CITY ENGINEER.

The report of the City Engineer is an able and well-arranged
document, reflecting credit on the Engineer and his department.

The receipts of the department for the year were ,
the expenditures being an increase in expenditures of
$  over the previous year. He accounts for the extra expense by the new work and additional duties devolving on his department by the provision in the charter designating the Engineer
to perform the duties of clerk to the Board of Public Works. believe it is for the interest of the city and the department of
engineering that the City Government petition the Legislature to
change section  title  of the charter so as to provide that the
Board of Public Works be empowered to elect clerk, whose duties

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
will be to keep the accounts of all departments under the management and control of said Board. Cabot street, between Main
street and the Willimansett bridge, has been paved with vitrified |
brick on the recommendation of the City Engineer. The recommendations that Cabot street, between Main and High streets,
should be paved, and that Pleasant street, between Dwight street
and Beacon avenue, should be widened, should receive your
earnest consideration. The report advises that the bridge over the
third level canal is in dangerous condition and ought to be removed. believe if the bridge is not safe to travel upon, we
should consider the advisability of erecting new bridge to be
built at the expense of the Holyoke Street Railway Company. The
City Engineer attended meetings and hearings in the year
 .

FIRE DEPARTMENT.

Holyoke is fortunate city in its freedom from fires; not so
much because of the excellence and efficiency of the Fire Department, but on account of the construction of its buildings and the
prudence of its inhabitants, notwithstanding all previous reports of
our chief executives to the contrary. The members of the Department themselves are competent and capable if not hampered by
their superiors.

It has become custom of late among the members of the
different companies to divide into factions, brought about, am
told, by the actions of the superior officers of the Department, who
have established system of tale-bearing and spying which if
allowed to go on will demoralize the effective work of the whole
Department.

The High Street Engine House, located in the center of the
business portion of the city, contains chemical engine, permanent force of firemen, an aerial truck, and steamer without horses.

If there should be large fire in the immediate neighborhood,
in order to-have the effective assistance of this steamer, horses
would have to be hired or men procured to draw the engine to the
scene of action.

MAYOR’S ADDRESS.  
The number of permanent men in the Department is twentynine. The number of call men is  The Commissioners report that they have thirty-two horses in the Department and state
that most of them are in good condition. They have purchased
seven new horses during the year. They report that the houses are
in excellent condition and will not need great amount of repairing this year.

They have connected in the Ward One Engine House the
heating system with the new Silsby heater and assert that by so doing they are saving large amount in the coal used for heating purposes in this house. They trust that their appropriation will be
increased this year so that they can appoint from three to five more
permanent men to the force. do not doubt but that this request
may be in the interest of better protection, but the Commissioners
must understand that the cost of their department is now about
one-ninth of the entire amount of money raised by taxation. And
I believe without crippling the Department that it is the duty of
the Commissioners to live as near within their appropriation as
possible.

The total appropriation for the year was .

BOARD OF HEALTH.

The Board of Health reports an improvement in the public
health, and decrease in the number of contagious diseases, as
compared with the year  The city has been comparatively
free from smallpox, there having been only one case, of which the
Board reports that it was notified ‘‘about the month of March.’’
I would suggest to the Board the expediency of reporting the data
of an epidemic disease of so serious nature as smallpox with more
care than they have shown in this instance. The Board discusses
at some length the question of garbage disposal and calls for the
utilization of Elmwood park for this purpose, on the ground that
Springdale is the only available place at present, and that the department would be enabled to reduce its expenses about 
per day, that sum being the difference between Springdale and
Elmwood park in cost of hauling. An annual saving of about

  MAYOR'S ADDRESS.
$  is worth making and the suggestion should receive our
careful consideration. The Board defends such use of the park
in their report, and commend that part of the document to your
perusal. The report sets forth the statistics of illness and deaths, |
but does not contain statement of the department's financial
operations and condition, an omission which the Board will be
called upon to explain to your executive. Since writing the above,
the Board has filed supplementary report supplying the omission,
but not in time to permit discussion of the same in the address.
CITY PHYSICIAN.

The City Physician reports that owing to the hard times he
visited great many outside patients, but is unable to state the
actual number except for the months of January, February and
March, during which time he made calls. This does not include the calls made at the almshouse, the city hospital and the
House of Providence hospital. He reports the general health of
the poor of the city as being very good, but says that the number
of his calls is increasing from year to year, which he ascribes to
the general depression in business.

MILK, VINEGAR AND PETROLEUM. |

The report of the Inspector is clear and concise statement
of the duties of his office. heartily agree with his suggestion that
the office and its duties do not receive the attention they deserve.
For by the faithful performance of his duties he undoubtedly saves
the city, by preventing the sale of oil of low quality, from considerable
loss. He also undoubtedly does much toward warding off disease
by preventing thesale of impure milk. He reports the total number of licenses granted for the year as  divided as follows: To
peddlers,  to keepers of stores,  He has paid into the
city treasury  in license fees. very interesting feature of
his report is his statement that the value of milk and cream sold
in the city for the year ending November was about
$ .

MAYOR'S ADDRESS.  
SCHOOLS.

We rely for information concerning the educational department of the city upon the annual report of the Superintendent of
Schools, which have not received. find, however, that the total
appropriations for the school year was the expenditures being The total enrollment in the public schools
for the year ending in June,  was  an increase over the
previous year of  .

CITY SOLICITOR.

The City Solicitor reports that the different departments experienced considerable difficulty in comprehending sections of the
city charter, which necessitated the preparation of many opinions
on the sections not understood. He reminds us that our city is
very fortunate in that we have had but very few personal injury
cases brought against us. He reports that there is now controversy existing between the Lyman mills and the city regarding the
amount of tax which the corporation has been assessed for the
years and  He follows with list of cases which have
been disposed of or are now pending.

BOARD OF ASSESSORS.

The Board of Assessors reports that it raised by taxation for
the year  more than they raised by taxation
for the year  The number of polls is  .

OVERSEERS OF THE POOR.

The Overseers state that owing to the continuous hard times
and the inability of the laboring man to obtain employment, they
have to report an increased expenditure in their department for
the year. They report that the number of families aided during
the year was  an increase of over the year in the
mumber of families aided. The number of persons aided during the
year was  an increase of in the number of persons aided
over the year  The total receipts for the year were  MAYOR'S ADDRESS.

large increase when we reflect that this department cost the city

almost one-tenth of the entire amount raised by taxation.
LICENSES. :

‘The granting of liquor licenses should not be question of importance in mayor’s inaugural address, except as it involves the observance or violation of the laws by citizens who are engaged in the
business. In the Mayor of this city induced number of
Holyoke’s heaviest taxpayers to assist him in procuring the passage
of bill by the State Legislature creating boards of license commissioners in cities. He represented that if such commissions were
created the liquor question would be taken out of politics, They
petitioned the General Court, which granted the petition on close
vote. The local Board was duly appointed and honest citizens were
hopeful that the liquor question and the liquor man would cease to
be factor in the politics of our city. But six months after the
passage of the bill the liquor men were compelled to organize in the
interest of candidate for chief executive of this city. Again in
  they were organized in support of another candidate for the
same high office. But last year, licensed dealers who pay  a
year for their privilege and are required to keep their doors closed
on Sundays and holidays, began to realize themselves how farreaching were the effects of the organization of the liquor business
as political force, when they discovered that the same power was
organizing illegal dealers, who, in return for their political influence were given police protection and permitted to sell in violation
of all law every day in the year. They protested and were inclined
to revolt against further coercion. But the element which has controlled our politics for several years past induced two members of the
licensing board to resign, and by holding the vacancies thus created
over their heads, again sucded in driving the licensed dealers
to support and financially contribute to their cause. But thinking
citizens, realizing that the liquor question was too much in evidence
in the affairs of our city, voted to relegate this class of our citizenship to political oblivion. now say to. them that under my administration there will be no illegal selling of liquor, if it is in my

MAYOR’S ADDRESS.  
power and the power of the police department to stop it, and that
I shall appoint as License Commissioner citizen who will not require liquor dealers to take an active part in politics on the one
side or the other in order to retain their licenses.

POLICE.

The police force of our city is well-appearing and is, ordinarily, well-behaved body of men; and if it were not for the dissensions that have divided it for some years, would consider it as ;
good as any force in the State. The differences now existing have
been brought about by the political activity of some of the officials,
—an evil which hope to be able to correct by making some
changes. Such changes think will be helpful to my administration and beneficial to the department. The Marshal reports that
the force as now organized consists of marshal, an assistant marshal, captain, lieutenant, police matron, and forty-one patrolmen, two of whom are detailed for special duty.

The total receipts of the department were The
expenditures are accounted for by the pay roll, and a
“ miscellaneous”’ item of ‘The regular salary of the
force would be which would be reduced somewhat by nonpayment of regular salary during the interval between the suspension of three dismissed officers and the appointment of their
successors. find by examining the pay roll, though the
Marshal’s report is silent upon the subject, that he has detailed to
regular duty an unnecessary number of special officers, some of
whom know to be unfitted physically and mentally to do police
duty. It is the popular belief that these men were given employment in this department for political purposes. assure the citizens
that shall see to it that the treasury of our city shall not be taxed
this year to further the political ends of any man or set of men. It
is hardly necessary to assert that such use of the department is a
menace to the good order and well being of the community. Indeed it appears from the Marshal’s report that he himself was not
wholly free from the influences that pervaded this department

during the closing days of the past year. For example, find that
he reports the whole number of arrests as  in enumerating

  MAYOR'S ADDRESS.
the arrests by sex, he reports males and females, total
of  He also gives table of arrests by months and this table
shows onlya total of arrests, discrepancy in the whole number of  Such carelessness on the part of the Marshal must not
occur while am chief executive. may add that it was my intention to summon before me the Marshal of  who acquired some
fame as State Senator by almost sucding in imposing upon usa
state police commission in the interest of good government, to
. make explanation of some of these things, but he evaded that unpleasant experience by tendering his resignation, to take effect two
days before the change of administration.
MUNICIPAL LIGHTING.

The citizens by an emphatic vote have declared that it is expedient to construct, purchase, lease or establish and maintain, to
quote the Statutes, “A plant for the manufacture or distribution of
electricity for furnishing light for municipal use and for the use of
such of the inhabitants as may require and pay for the same.” Believing that public service of this character ought not to be source
of gain to any member or group of members of the community at
the expense of all the other inhabitants, heartily indorse the
action of the citizens at the recent city election but the execution
of the popular will presents the most serious municipal problem of
the year. The first question which calls for our serious consideration is the manner of acquiring and establishing plant. While
the law provides that cities and towns may construct, purchase or
lease plant, this authority is restricted by further provision that
the person, firm or corporation owning an existing plant in the city
or town voting to engage in municipal lighting, may require, if it
so elects, in conformity with the requirements of the law, the city
or town to purchase its plant. Thus it will be seen that we can
neither build nor lease if the Holyoke Water Power Company elects
to sell its plant, course which we have strong reason to believe
the company will pursue. It will be further observed that although
we have voted in favor of lighting by electricity, we are required to
purchase from the company, if it decides to sell at all, both its

.

MAYOR’S ADDRESS.  
electric and gas plants. That portion of section  chapter  ,
of the act of  relating to this point reads as follows: ‘If in
such city or town single corporation own or operate both gas |
and electric plant, such purchase shall include both of such plants ;
but otherwise such city or town shall only be obliged to purchase
the existing gas plant or plants if it has voted only to establish a
gas plant, and shall only be obliged to purchase the existing electric
plant or plants, if it has only voted to establish an electric plant.”
According to this law, it would appear that if the Holyoke Water l
Power Company decides to compel the city to purchase its electric
plant, it must also part with its gas plant, and that we must engage
in the business of lighting by gas as well as by electricity. On the
other hand it would seem that if the company desires to continue
in the gas business it may do So by refusing to sell its plants to the
city, thus leaving to the city the right to furnish light by electricity
only, and to build or lease plant for that purpose. As much depends on the attitude of the company, and, as we are not positively
certain as to its state of mind, further consideration of this part of )
the subject at this time would be merely speculative. When the
manner of acquiring the system shall be fixed, however, we must
not forget our obligation to begin the performance of this new
function at the least possible cost to the city. In any event earnestly
request your honorable body to invest me with authority to appoint
a commission of our leading citizens to co-operate with the municipal authorities in this important matter. Payment for the system is subject which should receive our careful attention.
By the original act it is provided that the plant may be paid
for by the issue of bonds payable in term not exding thirty
years and bearing interest at rate not exding five per cent,
and that the indebtedness thus created shall not be included in the |
limit of indebtedness fixed by law. The interest on the bonds and )
a sinking fund to meet them at maturity must be provided for as ,
required by section of chapter of the Public Statutes, and the
bonds so issued cannot exd in amount two and one-half per
cent of our total valuation of estates as fixed by the last State valuation. This would enable us to raise in this way about ,
which would appear to be sufficient for the purpose. It is also

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
provided by chapter of the acts of that instead of issuing
these bonds we may pay the debt incurred by making annual payments of such amounts as will inthe aggregate extinguish the debt
within term not exding thirty years, and issue bonds, notes or
scrip therefor; but that the amount required each year shall be
assessed by the assessors in the same manner as other taxes are
assessed until the whole debt shall be paid. These questions re| garding the mode of payment will leave to the consideration of
your honorable body, hoping that you will give the subject your
earliest opinion and introduce an order empowering your executive
to appoint commission of citizens to act in conjunction with the
officials of this government in making all necessary arrangements
for the purchase and operation of the system. |

CONCLUSION.

. Gentlemen —Since our election to office the management of
some of our departments has been changed by resignation and new
appointments. hope such change will be for the public welfare.
As we start the wheels of legislation for the year in motion,
I appeal to you to work in reason and harmony on all questions
and measures affecting the public good. Let us keep uppermost in our minds the thought that if we would give the best govstnment we must be governed in the discharge of our official
obligations by the will of our constituents, who are the real lawmakers and whose will is the foundation of our municipal structure.
For my own part, it will be my constant aim to be true to my purpose of giving the citizens an honest, economical and  business-like
administration.

REPORT I.
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON
ANNUAL REPORT.
Crry oF HoryoxeE, Mass.,
OFFICE OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE,
. December .
To the Honorable, the Mayor of the City of Holyoke: |

Dear Sir :— The School Committee herewith tender to you,
and, through you, to the citizens of Holyoke, the following report
of the School Department.

Dep rting somewhat from the custom of other years, this
report is largely made up of the reports and recommendations of
the various sub-committees of the School Board. municipal report should be carefully prepared statement of the exact condition
of the department. It should give history of the year’s prodings, render to the public faithful account of what has been
done toward the furtherance of public interests, and leave record
of findings for the guidance of those who sucd to the conduct of
affairs. Actuated by this thought, each of the fifteen sub-committees, under the approval of the School Board, has prepared its report ;
and the entire budget of reports constitute business document
which should be read by every citizen of Holyoke.

The report of the School Committee contains :—

 Report of the Committee on Attendance.—Your attention is especially called to the marked increase in the enrollment,
membership and attendance of pupils in our schools. The increase
this year has been ten per cent over the year preceding. This is a

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

fundamental factor to be considered in determining requisite provisions for the needs of the sucding year. The report also
presents the needs for more school buildings and points to neighborhoods of greatest urgency.

 Report of the First District Committee, showing the
condition of the West Street School, the Dwight Street School, the
Bridge Street School, the Lyman Street School, the Chestnut Street
School, the Ewingville School, and the West Holyoke School. The

 report, in particular, contains important information and advice to
the Board of Public Works and to others charged with the responsibility of our school buildings.

 Report of the Second District Committee, showing the
condition and needs of the Appleton Street School, the South
Chestnut Street School, the South Street School, the Back Street
School and the Elm Street School. The report, in particular, contains information of importance to the Board of Public Works and
to others whose duty it is to provide adequate and satisfactory
buildings for the accommodation of the school children.

 Report of the Third District Committee, showing the
condition and needs of the Hamilton Street School, the Park Street
School, the Nonotuck Street School, the Sargeant Street School,
the Springdale School, and the Ingleside School. The report, in
particular, contains information of importance to the Board of
Public Works and to others charged with the responsibility of providing adequate and suitable schoo] accommodations.

 Report of the Committee on Tratning School, giving its
history and the reasons of its discontinuance.

 Report of the High School Committee. This report has
special importance at the present time. Because of the prospective completion of our new High School building and the demands
of the times for comprehensive school of larger usefulness, we are
now ata point where the situation asks that this year should be
characterized by the centralization of every possible and consistent
effort in the expansion and enrichment of the High School. The
anticipatory action taken during the past year has met the pronounced approval of the patrons, as shown by the increase of the
High School fully twenty per cent. The promise is even more

. REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE,  
marked that the occupation of the new building will call forth an
attendance making even greater demands. We are now entering
on period of great opportunity. Our new High School, as “the
People’s College,” should be temple devoted not simply to the
lines of work pursued in the past, but to an education in literature,
science, industry and art of wider usefulness to the entire community. The present, past, and prospective costs of the High
School are plainly stated, together with comparisons with other
cities. Particular attention is called to the plans for the improvement and expansion of high school work.

 Report of the Committee on Evening Schools, holding
sessions in the West Street School, the Appleton Street School,
North Chestnut Street School, Hamilton Street Schoo], Lyman
Street School and Springdale School. The plan of the evening

. schools has been greatly improved, and yet, as will be seen, without
material increase in cost of maintenance. The committee suggests
even greater improvements.

 Report of the Committee on Rules, being brief resume
of the changes going into effect January .

 Report of the Committee on Text Books and Courses of
Study. This report shows the cost of text books purchased last
year, with classification by months and by studies. The names of
authorized books are given and the changes in the courses of study
are described. It will be interesting to note that the entire cost of
all expenditures for text books, maps, teachers’ helps and libraries
was only an average of  for each child.

 Report of the Committee on Supplhes and Printing.
This report shows the cost of all supplies purchased under the
authority of the committee, with detailed classification by buildings
and departments of study. ‘The entire cost of all educational supplies, during the year, was  (average) foreach child.

 .—A Report of the Committee on Music. This report shows
the changes made during the year. The entire cost for supervision, ‘
books and supplies has been twenty-five and one-half cents per
pupil.

 .—A Report of the Committee on Drawing and Writine. In
drawing, the average cost per child (including two supervisors and

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

all material) has been sixty-five cents. The improvements in the
plans and course of study are indicated. In the department of
writing the average cost (including two supervisors, books and
material) has been forty-three cents per pupil. The reasons for the
adoption of vertical writing are presented and the results discussed.

 .—A Reportof the Committee on Manual Training and Kindergartens. During the yearthree kindergartens have been opened.
‘The results are discussed. The law governing instruction in
manual training is stated, and the plans for next year’s work are
indicated.

 .—A Report of the Committee on Health and Physical Culture. This is in reality one of the most important reports of the
entire budget. The defects, at least as far as concern sanitation of
our buildings, are indicated; attention is called to places where
improvement should be made and recommendations are presented
for more careful safeguards around the health of the children. The
average cost of the present work in physical culture for the past
year has been seventeen and three-fourths cents per pupil. The
report presents many important facts, needs and recommendations
for consideration all of which should be carefully weighed by the
Board of Aldermen, Board of Public Works, the Board of Health,
the School Committee, and the teachers of our schools.

 .—A Report of the Committee on Salaries, This report gives
our present scale of salaries and the increases of the past year, and
also comparative tables, showing salaries paid in other cities in
Massachusetts.

 .—A Report of the Committee on Finance and Accounts.
This report states the entire appropriation and receipts of the year
and carefully analyzes all expenditures. Comparisons are made
with other years; and also with the schools of other Massachusetts
cities. ‘The report gathers in its several tables the cost of all the
working committees of the Board, and indicates in very complete
manner the financial costs of the department. In growing city
like this there are many growing needs which are absolute. Great
pains have been taken during the year to make every dollar expended produce the greatest possible amount of good to the schools.
The action of every committee has been marked by careful, systemREPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
atic economy. ‘The report tells its own story. It is hoped the
report will be read in detail by every person contributing to the
support of our schools.

 .—A Report of the Superintendent of Schools. This report
gives brief summary of school statistics. It discusses child life
and the needs of greater flexibility in school gradation. Statement
is made concerning the appointment of teachers during the past
year, and what has been done for the improvement of teachers.
The need of trained and experienced substitutes is presented. The
report discusses the curriculum and the characteristic needs of the
several departments of study. The kindergarten, the primary schools,
the grammar schools, the High School, and the evening schvols, all
receive careful attention. Description is given of the annual festivals
of the schools: The Spring Festival, the Autumnal Festival, the
Patriotic Festival. Statement is made concerning the Christmas
Annual, published by the school children, and argument is offered
for an annual exhibition of school work, and in particular, an Educational Congress on the opening of the new High School. The
storm signal receives attention, and also the building needs of the
schools. ‘The report concludes with some pertinent remarks concerning the policy of the present administration and what must be
done to make the work of the Holyoke schools as it should be.

 .—Reports of the Principal of the High School, the Supervisor
of Music, the Supervisor of Drawing, the Supervisor of Writing,
and the Supervisor of Physical Culture. These all contain vaJuable
information concerning the ideals and plans of these departments,
and should be carefully read.

 .—Estimates for the Ensuing Year. In order that the purposes and needs of the department may be early before the people,
room will be given in the concluding pages of this year’s report for
the annual estimates of the incoming School Committee, the publication of which estimates herewith is permitted by the time of this
report going to press. Indeed, these estimates will be best understood in the light of the information presented in this report.

In Conclusion. The Committee on Annual Report expresses
the belief that this form of report has great value to the schools and

to the community. As it is somewhat critical, and does not hesitate

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
to point out the weaknesses of the schools, it may not be the best
kind of adocument tosend abroad but as an honest, straightforward
statement, it is well calculated to lead to improvement wherever
improvement is necessary. This much the School Committee has a
right to expect, that the report will be faithfully read by the citizens
of Holyoke. The members of the School Committee have given
much time to the management of school affairs, without salary, and
frequently at great deal of personal sacrifice. That this report,
prepared with great care, should be carefully studied, is little enough
toask. Considerable has been done during the past year for the ]
improvement of the schools; much yet is necessary. ‘To this end
the earnest co-operation of the entire community is invited. The
books of the department are always open. The meetings of the
Committee are invariably public. The members of the School
Committee, the Superintendent of Schools, and the teachers, will be
only too glad to talk with patrons concerning questions of school
interest. The doors of the schools are ever open, and the work of
the schools invites the closest inspection. Good schools, necessarily,
must cost money; but the greatest factor in the making of great
schools is not money, but the earnest co-operation of the entire community, and the recognition of the truism that the rights and just
privileges of the child must be entitled to pre-eminent consideration
in determining what shall be done for the child. To the end that
the plans of the School Committee for the continued improvement
of the schools may be understood and appreciated, this report should
be widely distributed and carefully read.
 For the School Committee,

of analysis would rob every other city of the New World of
its American character. The report, in fact, shows that there are
  Indians in the Holyoke schools, which is unfair. The committee contends that the child of an American citizen is an American and that his nativity should be indicated by the place of residence of his parents. It might be well to collate information concerning those who cannot speak English, but the table as it stands
is misleading.

As the statistics require, our Attendance Officers by personal
inspection made careful examination of the manufacturing, mechanical and mercantile establishments of the city, to see if the
laws are enforced relating to the employment of minors under
sixteen years of age. The inspection of mills, shops and stores,
made in December,  was very gratifying, and shows that the
overseers and employers are strictly complying with the law, as
regards the employment of minors. Only eighteen certificates
were issued to minors under fourteen years of age; and, of that
number, twelve had reached the ages of fourteen before the certificates had expired.

The committee would call attention to the excellent service
rendered by our attendance officers, Mr. T. W. Doyle and Mr.
Edouard Cadieux. These officers are required to take the census
of the city annually; to visit and inspect the mills, shops and stores,

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
to see that children are not employed contrary to law; to visit daily
all the schools of the city, and to immediately investigate all
absences to issue employment certificates, for which regular office
hours must be maintained in both morning and afternoon; to
make arrests and secure committal of all delinquents to daily visit
the health office, and to immediately quarantine all contagious diseases to carry communications between the Superintendent’s office
and the various schools; and to perform innumerable acts of effciency and convenience to the department. As our officers are
charged with the responsibility of all children named in the census
they visit the parochial schools as well as the public schools. The
high regard in which our service is held in other cities is evidenced
by the official positions held in state organizations. It is generally
conceded that Holyoke hasthe best system of attendance inspection
and enforcement in the state. This and the complexity of the
work made by the large number of mills, and the gradual reduction
of our assessments for the support of the County Truant School,
entitle the request of our officers, asking for remuneration consistent with the growth of the work, to very favorable consideration.

The committee would recommend :—

 That the recommendations of the State Board of Education, looking to the substitution of State Parental Schools for our ,
present system of County Truant Schools, and the change of name
‘truant officers’’ to ‘‘ attendance officers,’ be endorsed.

 That the name of this committee be changed to “Committee on Attendance.”

 That the petition of the School Committee to the Board of
Aldermen, passed December asking for new school buildings on the Highlands, in Oakdale and in Springdale, be reiterated.
We would also call attention to the rapid building development in
Elmwood and in Engleside.

 Thatthe salary of our Attendance Officers be increased
to  each.

 That questions affecting the boundary lines of districts
and privileges of attendance be referred to this committee.

 That careful attention be given to the motion now pending for mature consideration, which motion provides that, on the

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
opening of the new High School building, the Ninth grades shall
be transferred to the new High School building. The present
enrollment (December ,) of pupils in the Ninth grades is
as follows: Appleton,  Elmwood,  Hamilton,  West,
 Chestnut,  Nonotuck,  Ingleside, West Holyoke,  .
Scattered as these schools are, it is impossible to equalize enrollment or opportunity. Consolidation, as proposed, would doubtless
reduce the cost of instruction, and, more than that, would greatly
relieve the overcrowded condition of several of the larger buildings.
The question should be carefully considered.
Very respectfully submitted,
. THOMAS J. LYNCH,
WILLIAM A. MOORE,
HERMAN HEINRITZ,

REPORT III.
SCHOOLS OF THE FIRST
DISTRICT.

The First District contains the West Street School, the Dwight
Street School, the Bridge Street School, the Lyman Street School,
the Chestnut Street School, the Ewingville School and the West
Holyoke School. The average daily membership of pupils for the
term ending December,  was  the number of teachers
was fifty-one.

THE WEST STREET SCHOOL.

This magnificent new building, first occupied in October,
 has no superior among the grammar school buildings of the
state. The school consists of all grades from the kindergarten
through the Ninth grade, and is under the principalship of Mr. J. JLynch, who is assisted by fourteen regular teachers and two kindergartners.

The work in this building is very excellent. The principal and
teachers are devoted to their work and the pupils are full of zeal
and determination to do good work. In this school is being
demonstrated the ethical value of attractive surroundings. The
building with all its appurtenances  an object lesson of superior
worth to all the children fortunate enough to here attend. Even
the flood of pure air, changing in entirety every four or five minutes, has its happy influence for good school work. All of this is
manifested in the cheerful disposition of the school, the willingness
and energy displayed in work, and in the general atmosphere of,
good will and happiness pervading the many rooms.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  

The work is regular and well systematized. In some instances
there is an interchange among teachers, making it possible for certain branches in several rooms to be carried by teacher of special
interest in such work. Sewing is taught in all grades above the
third. One room is especially equipped as geographic and science
laboratory. The interest in all the subjects of study is good. The
large, fine auditorium on the third floor promises to be of great service to the school. With the opening of the fall term, kindergarten was established in the building, which is adding much to the
efficiency and happiness of the school.

More than one-half of the rooms of the West Street School are
equipped with adjustable furniture. The pupils are measured frequently and both desks and seats adjusted to the needs of the child.
The satisfactory results arising from the use of this furniture lead
the committee to recommend its more general adoption wherever
buildings are being equipped with new furniture.

The Board of Public Works should be requested to protect all
the basement rear windows with screens and to place gas or electric
fixtures on the stage. ,

Tne following pupils were graduated from the Ninth grade on
June The table also shows what they are doing at the
present time.

DWIGHT STREET SCHOOL.
The Dwight Street School contains two First grades, two
Second grades, two Third grades and two Fourth grades. During
the first seven months of the fiscal year the building was under the
principalship of Miss Abbie M. Morgan, but, with the opening of
the school in September, Mr. Henry W. Kirmayer was elected to its
management. Besides the principal there are eight teachers.

The schools in this building are pretty well equalized in
attendance. The principal has introduced many excellent plans ;
the teachers are deeply interested in their work and the improvement amongithe pupils, though gradual, is marked.

Up to the spring vacation the building was very unsightly and
unsanitary in its condition; but the improvement made by the
Board of Public Works, though not sufficient, has been of great
value to the school. The committee recommends that the Board
of Public Works be requested :

 To place the walls of the corridors in better condition.

 To varnish the sheathing and casings of the building.

 To add picture moulding to the rooms so as to avoid the
driving of nails for the hanging of decorations.

 To enlarge the sanitaries of the building to at least double :
the present capacity. This is imperative.
 To place the gutters about the building and also the fence |
in better condition. |
 To furnish the building with ventilation.
The committee would also recommend, to the School Board,
the removal of the old furniture in the lower southeast room and
the equipment with something of modern character.
BRIDGE STREET SCHOOL.
This school is within two blocks of the West Street School
and also the Dwight Street School. The building is planned for
eight rooms, all of which are occupied, there being two First
grades, two Second grades, one Third grade, one Fourth grade,
one Fifth grade, and one Sixth grade. The school is under the
principalship of Miss Mary J. Brainard, who is assisted by eight
regular teachers.

No chang? whatever has been made in the teaching force of
this school during the past year, except that made temporarily by
sickness. The teachers have been faithful in the discharge of their
responsibilities and the work has een gradually improving on the
standard of other years. The principal reports: “The number of
truants has lessened surprisingly, and the pupils, with very few exceptions, have shown deep interest in all their school work.” ‘The
school is to be congratulated on the rarity with which special cases
have been reported to the office.

The building has some very pronounced needs. The ventilation in the closet system is very bad. ‘The closets are near the
entrance and empty their foul air into the corridors to an insufferable extent. This condition must be corrected at once. No small
expense will rectify the difficulty the change must be radical. In
some of the rooms, the windows have never been weighted, in
others they cannot be opened. The northwest room on the lower
floor is excessively cold. We would recommend that storm windows be added to this room and that the floor or basement ceiling
be tightened. We also ask that the yard be properly fenced and
the grounds put in good condition. It is eminently important that
provisions be made for principal’s room on the ground floor,
instead of the present place in the attic where there is no possible
oversight of the grounds or opportunity to be accessible.

LYMAN STREET SCHOOL. |

With the opening of the West Street Grammar School and the
readjustment of boundary lines regulating the attendance of pupils

at the Dwight and Bridge Street Schools, 'the old Lyman street
property was abandoned for school purposes. Since that time it
has been discovered that children below the age of eight years (the

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE. |
age of compulsory attendance) were not attending school as they
should, owing to distance from. assigned building. It was therefore
thought best to re-open the Lyman street building, using the same
for primary school purposes. Miss Abbie M. Morgan, who for
many years had been principal of the Lyman Street School, was
returned to the principalship, besides whom there are two teachers.

The cost of maintaining this school for three months, and for
care of property during the preceding months, was as follows: For

educational supplies, for janitor, for building supplies, for truant officers, for gas and water,  ;

The Board of Public Works has paid: For repairs, for

Unless the attendance promises decided increase over present enrollment, the committee recommends the discontinuance of
one teacher at this building.
Not only the reason stated for the re-opening of this school,
but the fact that there has been an increase of thirteen rooms in
the schools of this section of the city during the past few years,
shows clearly that the Lyman street property should be put in good |
condition for school occupation. Anticipating its probable abandonment, the former City Property Committee allowed the building |
to get considerably out of repair. The principal, in her annua
report, says: The condition of the Lyman Street School is such
|

that cannot enumerate the needs. Your visit of investigation to
the building will prove the above statement.’”’ The committee
carefully investigated the condition of the building and recommends
that the floors, walls, ceilings, blackboards, cloakrooms, heating
apparatus and the ventilation, be put in good condition the coming
summer vacation. The building is also used for evening school
purposes.

THE CHESTNUT STREET SCHOOL.

This building was planned for eight schoolrooms, all of which
are occupied. The plan of the building is bad, but the interior has
been made to look quite attractive, owing mainly to the interest
the teachers have taken to supplement what has been done by the
city. The principal is Mr. F. J. Riley, besides whom there are
eight teachers

The principal and teachers in this building deserve great
credit for the excellence of the work accomplished under circumstances of some difficulty. The enrollment at the building represents many nationalities, quite number of whom, on entrance,
cannot speak English. The enrollment is fluctuating and, in part,
transitory. Notwithstanding this, the visitor cannot help being
impressed by the evidence of good work and the deep interest
manifested by the pupils.
The committee recommends: Book closets in rooms and  ;
small shelves in the chimney corners of each room; the substitution of curtains for inside blinds; the whitewashing of the basement; the cementing of the closet floor and repairs of basement
floor checks on the closet doors; locks on the book closets and
teachers’ desks; an outside electric gong; two small cases for
library books loam for the lawn; gas in the closet rooms, and a
suitable desk for the principal. The gas main entering the building should be enlarged. The principal also requests the addition
of an office room and emergency room, both of which would be |
very desirable. Request is also made for an organ or piano, made
all the more necessary by the removal of the piano formerly rented
by Mrs. Megrath.
This building is used also for evening school purposes, to the
very great inconvenience of the day school pupils; particularly as
much valuable time is lost by the necessary removal and packing
up of all the books and supplies each evening and in the distribution next morning, causing loss of fully half an hour each day.
Your committee recommends the gradual equipping of these rooms |
with closed desks, in which the pupils’ books and working materials
can be locked and left undisturbed. |

June The table also shows what they are doing at the

The school work of this building is very good indeed. The
teachers are faithful and the pupils interested. During the year the
school has been seriously inconvenienced by the frequent presence
of workmen, and by the lack of many needed improvements. The
teachers should be commended for their patience and fidelity.
Owing to the light enrollment which has characterized this building
for several years, the committee recommends the consideration
of the reduction of the teaching force at this building to two
teachers.
Much has been done by the Board of Public Works, during
the past year, to render this building fit for school occupancy, and
much is being done now. Your committee calls attention to the
following essential needs: The floors of the entrances and the
stairs are worn out and should be replaced. The schoolrooms
must be re-floored. ‘The blackboards must be repaired. case
for preservation of specimens and gifts, already collected, is needed.
The doors should be refitted. ‘These improvements would place
the building in fairly good condition.

During the year there was presented to the school by its
patrons, in recognition of the eminent services by Principal Lawrence, magnificent collection of art pictures and casts, being
probably the best graded collection of art decorations in any grammar school in America. This most worthy memorial to the fidelity
and efficiency of most worthy educator is delight to all who

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

breathe the atmosphere of the Appleton Street School, and will be
‘‘a thing of beauty and joy forever.”’ Most appropriately the
afternoon and evening of the  th day of June, the anniversary of
Mr. Lawrence’s connection with the school, were made the fitting
occasion for presentation to the school, at which time probably
  people called at the building to pay testimonial to the honored principal and to enjoy the beauty of the art collection, which
is now the property of the pupils of the Appleton Street School.
The collection has attracted the favorable comments of many educational magazines, has been visited by many educators from other
cities, and is no doubt establishing ideals in the decoration of schoolrooms and in the study of art that will be very suggestive to other
cities. fine art catalogue has been issued by the school which is a
valuable contribution to any library.

Attention should also be called to two other special monuments built by Principal Lawrence and his enterprising assistants,
both teachers and pupils; namely, the large and well-selected
professional and general library of famed books, the best of its kind
in Western Massachusetts; and the fine natural history collection
mounted in the upper corridor.

The work in this building is too well known to need special
comment. This is indeed one of the very best grammar schools in
all America. Departmental work has here reached high success.
Any person interested in visiting schools will find the atmosphere
of the Appleton an inspiration.

Beginning with September, kindergarten was opened in the
building, which has been attended by as many children as the two
kindergartners could instruct.

The building needs relief by accommodation of one hundred
pupils elsewhere.

The lower grades have been so overcrowded that many children have been compelled to spend three years in doing work which
should be done in two. The school should be reduced to the
maximum number of forty in room. When the school hall is
vacated by transfer of pupils elsewhere, the building will need a
piano.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  

The principal reports: ‘From time to time have called the
committee’s attention to the fact that the discipline and health of
the school are impaired on account of the noise of the motor and the
improper draughts, occasioned by old and imperfect windows. It |
is the opinion of competent judges that the motor should be placed
in the basement, that new windows should be put in throughout the
building, and that rooms and should be refurnished. respectfully call your attention to these three important matters, mo/or,
windows and furniture.”

The committee endorses these recommendations. Otherwise,
the building is in good condition.

SOUTH CHESTNUT STREET SCHOOL.

This building, under the principalship of Miss Belle O. Goldthwait, is limited necessarily to pupils below the Eighth grade. The

building is planned for eight schoolrooms, and yet, by the aid of
unsatisfactory sittings in unsanitary attic rooms and one storeroom,
four additional schools are housed. The number of teachers is
twelve with three regular assistants.

During the year the school has been greatly inconvenienced
by the lack of ventilation, the overcrowding of pupils, and the
necessity of working two teachers in the room. The pupils promoted in June from the Seventh grade were compelled to enter
the Eighth grade at the Hamilton School or the Elmwood School.

 This made the distance so great that many of these pupils have
quietly dropped out of school. Some of the higher grades have
been excessively full. Other rooms of entirely different grade have
had an irregular and therefore light enrollment; but the character
of the temporary rooms has not been such as to make desirable
adjustment easy. At the present time there are two schools which
might be consolidated, but this would probably complicate the
situation few weeks later. ‘lhe principal and teachers of this
building deserve very great commendation for the patience with
which they have sought to secure good school results under very
trying and disheartening circumstances. It is earnestly to be hoped
that relief will come soon, so that the education of deserving children may be accomplished under normal conditions. At least
should the city recognize the prime necessity of providing good
ventilation in overcrowded schools. ‘The sickness of teachers is
perhaps greater in this building than in any other in the city.

The committee recommends:

 That the building be equipped with some system of
ventilation.

 ‘Lhat the ceilings and walls be repaired and tinted.

 That the woodwork be re-varnished.

 ‘That gas fixtures be placed on third floor and in the office.
This is necessity because of the limited light on dark days.

 That the sanitaries in particular be better ventilated. ‘This
is very important.

 ‘That the building be equipped with an outside electric
gong.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
SOUTH STREET SCHOOL.

This school is usually called the Elmwood, but the growth of
Elmwood and the prospective need of more buildings in year or
two make distinctive name desirable; hence, it should be called
the South Street School. The Elmwood School now fills the new
building of eight rooms, the old Charlton street building of two
rooms, and rented storeroom on Harrison avenue. The principal is Mr. G. H. D. L’Amoureux, besides whom there are eleven
teachers.

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

From the report of the principal it is seen that few radical
changes have been made during the year, the main effort having
been directed to gradual systematizing of work already in progress. Advancement has been made in all lines, with least satisfaction in English. This is partly because of the great distance the
school is from the public library. The lack of literary material and
library facilities also seriously affect the work in English. During
the year an inexpensive form of manual training has been established
for the boys of the four upper grades. The outfit consists of a
working tray, which fits on the top of the regular school desk, and
is equipped with drawing tools, tri-square and jackknife. One
hour per week is given to this exercise, during which time the girls
are taught sewing; excepting that sewing is taught in all grades
above the third. This work in manual training and sewing is taught
by the regular teachers.

The closet system of the new building is exdingly objectionable. The closets are near the entrance and the draughts of the
building fill the halls and sometimes the rooms with foul and
unsanitary odors. This should be condemned by the Board of
Health. The lives of the children and teachers are too precious to
allow the continuance of this condition longer. The Board of
Public Works is now equipping the old building with new closets,
but this does not help the greater nuisance in the new building.
Attention is also called to the bad floors in many of the rooms, and
also to the need of better window curtains throughout the building.

Recommendation is made that the city should recognize the
growing school necessities of Elwmood. Steps should at least be
taken to immediately secure desirable piece of building land.

The Hamilton Street School is one of the best schools in the city
and is much sought by visiting teachers from other cities. The
principal is known all over the country as an accepted author of
text books and helps in arithmetic and geography. The work in
these two subjects is exceptionally strong. This was the first building in the city to introduce sloyd and sewing; in which, without
special teachers and without very much expense to the city, most
excellent results have been attained through the energy and willingness Of the principal and teachers. During the past year an exhibition of this department of industrial work was made, which

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

attracted the favorable comment of all who were fortunate enough
to see it. At the beginning of the fall term kindergarten was
opened in this building, which has relieved the First grade membership very much and has been source of much satisfaction to the
people. ‘The opening of the Park Street School as regular school
has also done much to relieve the usual congested attendance at the
Hamilton School, so that the rented room in use for year was discontinued in October.

While the work at the Hamilton has attained high standard,
there are some limitations to the full measure of good results. The
school is in section of the city where there is considerable fluctuation in residence and, consequently, in school membership. ‘There
is also great deal of shifting of pupils back and forth between the
public and parochial schools. ‘This is now in part obviated by a
tentative agreement between the several schools; but the changes
at the beginning of the year will still greatly affect the constancy
of the school’s membership. Also, there exists an unfortunate disposition among many of the people of this locality to early withdraw
the children from school to assist in the earning of the family’s livelihood. ‘This is shown in Table XXIX, by the respective memberships, and  in Grades Five and Nine. ‘This is greatly to be
deplored, for it denies the children the opportunity to arise, in
later years, to higher values in earnings and happiness. The halls
and cloakrooms of the building are inexcusably dark, which is a
matter of profound regret to all who enter the building. The long
distance which children must travel, in getting from Springdale to
the Hamilton, forces the bringing of lunches. For this accommodation there is no provision at the Hamilton Street School. The
committee recommends:

 The ventilation of the closets. ‘The stench is at times
unbearable and can be detected in all parts of the building.’’ This
condition is inexcusable.

 Understripping of room  which is immediately over the
cold air room. Many complaints have been received, stating that
sickness has been the result of this lack of protection. |

 ‘lhe walls and ceilings of the rooms and corridors of the
upper floor should be whitened.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  

 The transoms should be frosted, so as to exclude direct
sunlight, but let in diffused light.

 An examination should be made to see why the present
boilers do not properly heat the building in cold weather.

 sink should be placed in the hall to accommodate the
work in science.

 The platforms should be removed from the schoolrooms.
This is earnestly requested by the teachers.

 Bookcases are needed in rooms and  and linoleum
and principal’s desk in the office.

 Something should be done to afford more light at the
front entrance.

 place should be provided for storage of coal near the
boilers, and basement room should be converted into lunch
room and waiting place for use in stormy weather.

To sucd training school, containing model departments,
with regular school of less pretentions is no easy matter; but the
work of the new organization so far has been very satisfactory.
Indeed, the school presents some of the very best primary work of
the entire city. While all the work is averaging well, that in geography, science and reading is worthy of special mention. Excellent results are being obtained in sewing and in adapted work from
the kindergarten. The teachers are anxious for equipment for the
work in sloyd.

During the past year extensive repairs have been made by the
Board of Public Works, so that the rooms of the building are really
in very excellent condition. The pressing needs are :—

 Painting of the walls and ceilings of the corridors; and
also the sinks.

NONOTUCK STREET SCHOOL.

The Nonotuck Street building was originally planned for eight
rooms. Later third story was unwisely added to the building,
increasing the number of rooms to ten schoolrooms and hall.
Three years ago the hall was sub-divided into two schoolrooms.
All of this increase has been placed on an inadequate building, with
no enlargement of stairs, entrances, or conveniences for the care
of children. Besides these twelve rooms, the school is occupying
six tenement rooms in the immediate neighborhood. The principal is Mr. John A. Callahan, who is assisted by seventeen teachers.
As will be seen, there are three First grades, one mixed First and
Second grade, two Second grades, one Third grade, two Fourth
grades, two Fifth grades, one Sixth grade, one mixed Sixth and
Seventh grade, one Seventh grade, one mixed Seventh and Fighth
grade, one Kighth grade, one mixed Eighth and Ninth grade, and
one Ninth grade.

The Nonotuck is equipped with the greatest and most potent
factors in the making of school; namely, an attentive, efficient
principal and good teachers. ‘lhe spirit of the school is very progressive and the ideals and plans for growth and improvement
decided and admirable but the work is carried on under many
discouraging circumstances. The building is an architectural monstrosity, of poorly lighted and poorly ventilated rooms, of narrow
halls, dangerous stairs, dangerous fire escapes, and sanitaries not
one-seventh the accommodation of those at the West Street School.
The six outside tenement rooms, five for regular schools and one
for overflow work, are too small for even the reduced number of
pupils assigned to such rooms, and are located in three cases in
places of great danger. Many of the other rooms are overcrowded
and the teachers heavily laden with work. Nothing has been done

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
to renovate the walls for fifteen years so that the interior is dirty and
unsightly, excepting as the teachers have made attempts at decoration, which only make the uncleanly background look all the more
unfortunate. It seems strange that this school, by nearly fifty per
cent the largest in the city, should have been neglected so long ;
particularly after the faithful and strenuous appeals which have been
made by the principal, the superintendent and the school committee
in the successive reports of several years. Counting out the extraordinary expenses of tenement schools, the Nonotuck has received
proportionately less financial consideration than any other school in
the city.

It is credit to the principal and teachers that so much has
been accomplished under such circumstances. The work of the
school averages well. Much has been done by the teachers and
pupils to awaken an interest, throughout the entire city, in Nature
work. Popular lectures have been given, under the auspices of the
school, by capable, scientific persons. The work in history is
exceptionally strong, and great interest has been manifested in
arithmetic. Some of the teachers have raised money in various
ways and purchased pictures for schoolroom decoration. It is
expected that way will soon be found for furnishing the whole
building with first-class works of art. Sewing has been introduced
during the year and is now taught to the girls of grades Four, Five,
Six and Seven, the exercise taking one hour per week. This work
is under the charge of Miss T. D. Reardon. ‘The school looks forward to many movements for extension and enrichment of the
work as soon as the building limitations permit.

The following statement of needs is urged on the consideration of all concerned :—

 There must be relief by another building; but the city
should not forget the obligations due the teachers and pupils who
must continue to live in the old building. Certainly ten years is
long enough to wait for needed improvements, which have been
repeatedly requested.

 The heating system is dismal failure.

 Steps should be taken to equip the building with stairways
of less danger. Only the constant vigilance of the principal, who

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
never fails to take his stand where he can avert danger, while the
pupils are passing out, saves this school from great disaster. Ifa
panic ever arises in this school, the stairs are so contrived that such
panic will be uncontrollable. The present so-called “fire escapes’”’
should be improved or removed in the interests of common safety
from the building. These dangers are so great that the committee
has hesitated to speak of them ina public manner for fear of creating alarm, but the time has now come when the recommendations of
other years must be made the positive demand of the present. It
should be further said, that besides the front door the only exit for
this enormous school is through the boys’ closet. The windows in
the third story are so dangerously near the floor that an iron guard
should be placed across the lower sashes.

 The sanitary condition of the building is miserable because
of the closets. The girls’ closets are practically in the hallway and
have accommodations for only three. The boys’ closets are equally
limited and cannot be heated.

 place for the storage of coal, more convenient to the
furnaces, should be provided.

 Protection should be made against drainage into the building at the rear wall.

 The fence and the roof should be repaired.

 The water main in the building is too small. Water will
not flow at the drinking hydrant on the third floor when the lower
faucets are running. Several of the faucets need repairing.

 crosswalk on West Hampden street is very much needed.

 The northeast room on the top floor is not protected by
storm windows. They should be provided at once.

The needs at this building are so radical that it might be well
for the Board of Public Works to compare the aggregate cost of
the probable changes of several years with the cost of new building. Itis said that such necessary changes in the Appleton Street
School cost over leaving an old building in the end. The
committee urge the immediate consideration of these needs, and
for more detailed statement, refer to Principal Callahan's recommendations, contained in the Annual Report of  .

The Sargeant Street School has an idividuality of its own, the
distinguishing feature being the marked interest the principal and
teachers take in the personal welfare of each child. This makes the
school happy home and gives most excellent basis for good work.
The language work is greatly to be commended. The school is also
very proud of their well won possession of the contest piano, for
which they are greatly indebted to their many friends, and especially
to Mr. P. J. Kennedy, proprietor of the Holyoke Daily Democrat.

The repairs made by the Board of Public Works have been most
excellent in character. Unfortunately the building has no system
of ventilation. New floors are needed, and the sanitaries should be
repainted. The heating apparatus does not seem to be sufficient to
properly warm the building on cold days. Picture moulding should

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
be placed in the rooms. Since the repairs made in building the
school pictures have not been hung. The basement should be whitewashed. Request is made by the teachers for the revarnishing of
the furniture, case for supplies and four tables.

Particular mention is made of the neatness of the building, the
careful attention to matters of small detail, and the beauty of the
lawn and flowers in summer time. For this, commendation is
largely due to the efficient janitor of the building. The grounds of
the Sargeant Street School are the pride of the locality.

SPRINGDALE SCHOOL.

The Springdale School is under the charge of Miss Agnes C.
Kelley who is assisted by two teachers. There are two rooms in
the sc hool building, besides which there is an overflow room in the
adjacent hose house. The grades represented are the First, Second
and Third but there are many children who should be accommodated at this building, but because of lack of room are compelled to
travel over mile to the Hamilton Street and other schools.

The work in the Springdale schools is good, and the interest of
the teachers and pupils is to be highly commended.

If the building accommodations in this section of the city are
to remain the same, the following needs should receive attention :
The walls and ceilings should be whitewashed, the blackboards

repainted, and the plumbing inspected. The operation of the
" water motor is too noisy. There should be board or other walks
made, so the teachers and pupils may be in no danger of disappearance in trying to reach the building in muddy weather. As is
shown by the report of the Committee on Health, the basement is
very damp and unsanitary, the back wall being covered with a
dangerous mould. stove placed in this room would dry the basement and make it convenient for model room. closet should
be builtin the basement for the storage of the janitor’s tools and |
supplies. Theclosets are out of doors and should give way to
something that can be called sanitary. The furniture should be
revarnished, and bookcase is needed in each room. The school
grounds should be fenced.

One school is at present accommodated in the hose house, the
hose-reel occupying the same room. If the use of this room is to
continue it should be equipped with blackboards and curtains, and
a board walk should lead to the entrance.

However, the committee urge that the Springdale schools
have already outgrown the building, that the engine house is not a
proper place for school, that other children should be schooled
at Springdale instead of being sent to the Hamilton, Park and Sargeant buildings, and that the prospective growth of Springdale
points to rapid increase in school membership. We therefore
recommend the erection of an eight-room building at Springdale ;
or of four-room building so arranged as to permit an acceptable
addition of four rooms later on.

The committee in their inspection of buildings found the
Springdale building inexcusably dirty, which finding at that time
has been verified by general reports. We therefore recommend
a change of janitor.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
INGLESIDE SCHOOL.

The Ingleside School is the oldest school building in the city.
The teacher is Mr. Thomas McCoy, whose pupils, in October, were
in classes asfollows: Grade IV, seven pupils; grade V, six; grade
VI, five grade VII, two; grade VIII, one; grade IX, one; total,
 Mr. McCoy’s salary is .

janitor, building supplies,  truant officers, ;
miscellaneous, total, making the average per
Capita cost The Board of Public Works has paid: For
repairs,  fuel, The property is appraised at ,
not including furniture.

During the early part of the year the school was greatly disturbed by the sickness of the regular and supply teachers assigned
to this building, said sickness, it is claimed, being caused by the
lack of proper protection in the building against cold. This
increased the cost of instruction above the regular salary. Some repairs have been placed in the building since then, and Mr. McCoy
has been appointed to the charge of the school. The school has
been doing well. |

The building needs: New panels in the outer doors, and new
latches to the doors. The boys’ closet should be put in proper
order. The roof must be repaired.

The rapid growth of Ingleside makes the building needs at this
point somewhat problematic. An ungraded school should not enroll
over thirty pupils; already thirty-nine are enrolled, and the prospect for next year is for decided increase. If there could be any
way by which the old Springdale building could be moved to this
point, in case of erection of new one there, this part of the city
would be accommodated for several years.

The Third District Committee have had charge of rented rooms
during the past year as follows: Nonotuck, six rooms; Hamilton,

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
one; Sargeant, one; beside the school in the Springdale hose
house. The only relief during the year has been by gaining the
Park Street building for regular school purposes. This has enabled
us to discontinue one room, and we are trying to find ways of discontinuing one other.

At meeting of the School Board, held August vote
was passed authorizing the establishment of Training School, and
a principal teacher was ultimately elected for it. Miss Bertha
Pierce of North Attleboro was duly elected to the principalship,
which she was compelled to decline because of her previous
acceptance of appointment in Nashville.

Efforts to obtain suitable teacher were not relaxed, and were
at length crowned with success in the authorizations voted February and for opening the school and the engagement of
Miss Katherine Hurlburt of Weathersfield, Conn. The Training
School was opened March and twenty-one students, all

to the Third District Committee for regular school purposes.

In anticipation of the closing of the Training School, the
School Committee, on December passed the following
rules determining the qualifications of teachers eligible for appointment in the Holyoke schools :—

 Candidates for appointment in the High School must
present equivalence of graduation in some reputable college.

Candidates for appointment below the High School (graduates
of the Holyoke Training excepted) must present equivalence of
graduation in the Holyoke High School and also equivalence of
graduation in one of the Massachusetts State normals. Candidates
for first primary grades should also present some knowledge of the
principles and practices of the kindergarten.

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

Candidates for appointment in the kindergartens must present
equivalence of high school graduation and also two years’ successful
training in some reputable kindergarten normal.

Candidates for appointment as supervisors must give evidence
of eminent preparation in higher schools devoted to specialized training, and of pronounced success in other high standard schools.

years president of the Throop Polytechnic Institute of Pasadena,
Cal., was elected principal. Mr. Keyes brought to the school a
thorough scholastic training, large administrative experience, and a
national reputation. Anticipating an early transfer of the school to
the new building, the corps of High School instructors was also
largely re-organized. |

Total salaries for year ending July 

The cost of maintaining the High School during the year has
been: For teachers, supervision, including instruction by special teachers,  text books and educational supplies,  janitor, building supplies,  ;
census and attendance office, furniture, rent,
$ gas and water, miscellaneous, total,
$ making the average cost for each student, .*
The Board of Public Works has expended: For repairs and necessary changes in old building,  for fuel, .

Whatever may have been the successes of the past, this much
is plain—a new era in High School work began with the inauguration of Principal Keyes and his capable associates. The old building was arranged, by the sub-division of rooms, so that greater
number of classes could be accommodated. New courses of study
were constructed, giving pupils the most generous opportunity for
individual selection. An effective system of conferences with the
pupils and patrons was inaugurated. The courses of study were
brought more into line with the colleges and the demands of life.
At once the new plans met with the most emphatic endorsement on
the part of the patrons of the school. An examination of tables XVII,
XXI, XXV, XXVIII, XXX and XXXIII will show that of the  
pupils graduated from the grammar schools June  are now
(December) attending the High School, one is abroad, fourteen are
at work, and five are at home. This, in an industrial city, is an

exdingly good showing. Besides these, the admission from other
sources swelled the entrance class to students. The opportunity for advanced work has also caused the return of twenty-one
graduates and others for more extended work. Even under the
continued bad environments of the old building, where the classes
are compelled to work in unfortunately large sections, the number |
of pupils of the fall term shows an increase of eighty-five over the
average daily membership of last year, which is the strongest possible endorsement of the policy of the committee in seeking to
enrich the High School with better opportunity. ,

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
It will be seen that the average per capita cost of the High
School, on basis of fall term standard, is now as compared
with  in  making an increase of seven percent. The
vital question to be considered in this comparison is not, has the
per capita cost in the High School increased seven per cent, but has
the improvement in the High School kept pace with the increase in
cost? Is the High Schoo] producing more or less results now than
it was producing before the teaching force was increased and
enriched ?

By this table it will be seen. that our present per capita cost
(school year ending July of  is entirely within the
precedents established by the high schools of Massachusetts cities.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  

These statistics were obtained from information furnished
direct from the schools represented. It is probable that some of
these schools have reported enrollment of pupils instead of average
daily membership, which latter is made the basis of all the Holyoke
population. The effect of such discrepancy, if any, would be to
lessen the per capita showing in such cities below what the cost
really is. Furthermore, it might be added that the Holyoke High
School is now running (for school year ending July ,) on an
average per capita cost of It is definitely known that many
of the high schools in the other cities named have made proportionate or greater increases.

The first year of entrance of high school on new building,
so large as ours and so full of opportunity to do good to greater
number of people, would naturally be marked with some increased
expense for salary. The expansion of the school from old quarters,
where the work was necessarily done by Jarge classes in few class
rooms, and consequently with few teachers, to building of adequate opportunity to do work advantageously in smaller classes,
would certainly make some demands. Added to this, the change
from course of study, largely college preparatory and of limited
choice of study, to seven courses of study, each containing the most
generous opportunity for variation and for adaptation to the demands
of modern life, would certainly be attended with enlarged costs.
But it was for this reason that Holyoke built its magnificent new
High School, not simply to be an architectural structure, but an
institution of greater usefulness in the upbuilding of Holyoke. In
expression of this manifest intent of the will of the people, the plans
of the committee contemplate not simply classical school, but a
comprehensive school of classics, modern languages, literature, history, economics, science, business training, industry and art, all
under single roof, and affording liberal training for any and all
the demands of modern life. The building will be the natural
center of the community’s culture. Not only pupils of the typical
high school will here find advantages, but extension courses of
study will give opportunity for those who wish to remain longer or
return for continued study. The High School, with doors open
and with supplemental sessions both afternoons and evenings, must

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
be the character of the new school. The evening High School will
probably occupy the same building and be guided by many of the
same instructors. The great auditorium will be utilized in bringing
to the people, young and old, systematic course of popular
instruction while the art, science and economic rooms will give
opportunity for specialized training. Foreseeing all this and more
in the up-building of greater high school of greater usefulness
and greater contact with the masses, the High School Committee
has sought to bring, to the charge of the several departments, professiona] educators who could be of great service in the unfolding
and development of this policy, and who could be of great value to
the community in broader sense than is comprehended in the
school of older type. The increase of nearly one hundred pupils
has also made many additional demands. These several factors in
the work of transition, expansion and enrichment have justified
the committee in increasing the salary budget of the High School
from an abnormally low standard of  to With
the entrance of the school to the new building, the addition of manual training, domestic science, extension of the science, English
and business courses, and also the necessary provision for one hundred additional pupils, the committee recommends an appropriation for High School salaries, for the year ending Nov. ,
of This would mean an increase to standard in the following year of which would give us school fully equipped
with teachers in all departments of work. With this coming standard reached, it is not believed that there would be need of anything
but minor increases for several years. Contrasted with what other
cities are doing and propose to do, these estimates are not excessive; and it is believed that the greater usefulness of the High
School and the opening the doors to larger numbers will abundantly
justify these improvements and show that the people are with what
will be The People’s College.’"” The committee takes it that it is
for this the new High School is being built.

As has been intimated the regular courses of study in the
High School have been greatly increased and enriched.

FIXTURES FOR LABORATORIES AND OTHER

DEPARTMENTAL ROOMS.

During the past year the superintendent and committee have
spent much time in preparing for the completion and equipment of
the new building. Acting under the appointment of the Board of
Public Works and under the approval of this committee, the superintendent made careful study of all the modern high schools in the
country, visiting many of the high schools of Massachusetts in
person. Detailed drawings and specifications for the laboratories
and advised finishings of other rooms were prepared, and were submitted to the Board of Public Works, but the complication in the
building contract has delayed action until the present time. The
committee regretted this:

 Because of the strenuous need of early completion of the
building.

 Because we are fearful the changes that will be enforced
by the doing of this work after the building is completed will greatly
increase the cost of such necessary work.

 Because the work could be done with better finish at time
of original construction.

 Because the interests of the High School have been delayed
so long already that we wish to avoid further interference with
successful work.

However, we have faith that the Board of Public Works has
acted and will act for the best interests of the school, but we hope

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
the day is close at hand when prompt attention can be given to this
necessary work. The superintendent and committee have placed a
great deal of time on the specifications of this work, which it is
believed will be matter of satisfaction to the people of Holyoke.

For purposes of present information and future reference, the
laboratory and other finishings so requested are here briefly

SPECIAL NOTE.—
It should be borne in mind that these laboratory necessities
require many water supply and drainage pipes, and especially large
and independent gas pipes, distributed in many cases over all parts
of the room. These gas pipes, water pipes, and drainage pipes |
must reach mains descending through many rooms of lower stories
and pass in twenty-one courses through the basement. The
laboratory fixtures also require numerous changes in wall finishings,
and omissions and additions of blackboards. It is positively necessary that this work should be attended to before the final finishing
of the building. As these mains and pipes descend through other
rooms of the building it is apparent that the necessity affects nearly
the entire building.

The committee once more urge the absolute necessity of the
immediate completion of this work, for which there have been
received by the Board of Public Works  by appropriation and
six thousand dollars ($ by change in recommendation concerning staircases. The School Committee have thoroughly investigated these necessities and specifications and are in position to
realize how much is dependent upon this work. There are involved
the saving of greater expense than if done at later date, the saving
of time in completion and occupancy of building, and the preservation of the beauty and finish of the building itself.

EQUIPMENT FOR HIGH SCHOOL.

On the  th day of January request was made, asking the
Board of Aldermen to appropriate  for the furnishing and
equipment of the new High School, which petition was unanimously granted. The following plans were presented, showing in
detail how this money is to be expended.

IN CONCLUSION.

With our new building, including laboratories and furnishings,
with our efficient corps of teachers, with the largely increased membership of the school which we feel justified in expecting, and with
the extended scope of the school as an institution of larger usefulness, it is believed we are now entering upon an era of great educational opportunity, which will make Holyoke known far and near
as city of culture, civic pride and progress.

of the High School, the reader is referred to the Superintendent’s

The sessions of the evening schools have been held on Monday,
Tuesday, Thursday and Friday evenings. ‘The Chestnut, Hamilton,
Lyman and Springdale schools are for elementary pupils, many of
whom are illiterates. The work in these schools is steadily improving, but much yet remains to be done.

The evening grammar school held in the West Street building
is very satisfactory school, not so much in large numbers as in the
earnestness and work of the student. No pupils are admitted excepting those qualified to enter the sixth grade school work. These
pupils are not required to come to school and are very regular, the
difference between the membership and the attendance being made
almost entirely by the fact that some must work on certain nights of
the week. The studies pursued have been: Writing, business forms, .arithmetic, grammar, geography, history, algebra, bookkeeping and
mechanical drawing. Added to this instruction, lectures have been
given on occasional Friday evenings. At the end of the forty
nights seventy-four of the pupils presented requests for continuance
of the school for additional months as follows: For three months,
seventy-four; for four months, fifty-five; for five months, thirtynine for six months, thirty. ‘This number has since been increased
to one hundred and eight.

The evening drawing school is maintained for sixty evenings
of the year. Classes are two in number, meeting on alternate evenings; so the attendance on any one evening is only half the recorded number. The change in the plan of the school, having two
classes meet each twice per week instead of three classes each once

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
per week, has been an excellent thing for the school. The school
will begin January with thirty-four pupils.

The committee urges better provision for the evening schools
as follows :—

 The term of evenings should be gradually lengthened.
While many come to school because of legal compulsion, we are
not doing enough for others who are anxious for greater improvement. The term is so short that beginners gain almost nothing
from the school. With greater length of term perhaps it might
also be good thing to make the session three evenings per week
intead of four. Thursday being pay night always brings depreciated attendance.

We would recommend that the number of evenings of the
elementary schools for the next year be increased to sixty, providing the interest justifies. This would not affect this year’s estimates.

 Earnest consideration should be given to what can be done
to provide larger furniture for these pupils. The majority are grown
persons, or nearly so, and yet they are crowded into furniture in
some instances intended for pupils five and six years old. Itisa
matter of surprise that so much can be accomplished under such
circumstances.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  

 It would probably be well to bring the few pupils who
attend the Springdale evening school by street cars to the Hamilton
street building. Twenty-eight dollars would have paid the entire
cost of transportation this year, while the cost of maintaining the
Springdale school has been .

 Something should be done to provide the elementary
evening school with more suitable books. The books in use are
those discarded years ago by the primary day schools. Baby stories
and baby thoughts do not appeal to adult persons of practical life,
even if they are beginning the study of English. Much study
should be put on this consideration, for it will not be an easy thing
to find books well adapted for use in such schools.

 We would recommend that the evening drawing school be

. placed under the care of the Evening School Committee and consolidated with the evening grammar school.

 We would recommend that the evening grammar school
be continued twelve weeks beyond January  with meetings on
Monday, Wednesday and Friday evenings.

 We would recommend that all appointments for the evening schools be for such time only as the size of the school justifies.

 We would recommend that pupils of the evening grammar
school completing the grammar grade course of study be granted
graduation and diplomas the same as pupils in the day school.

 g. We would recommend that the estimates for the coming
year should include: For books and educational supplies, seventy
cents for each pupil of the average membership in the evening .

school;  for each pupil in the evening drawing school; and
$  for all advanced far enough to enter upon high school classes.

REPORT IX.
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE
ON RULES.

Beginning with January the following new rules have
been in effect.

 The election of chairman, the Mayor formerly acting in
that capacity.

z. Election of new committee on manual training and kindergartens assignment of music and physical culture to separate
committees designation of committee on physical culture as committee on health and physical culture.

 Definition of duties of standing committees.

 Election of superintendent to occur in April and cover a
period of two years.

  Centralization of responsibility in hands of superintendent.

 ‘*The superintendent shall be the head of his schools,
and as such, shall have voice in the councils of the board and of
the various committees. He shall nominate his assistants and the
teachers, make all assignments and transfers of teachers, and have
entire charge of the classification, examination and promotion of
pupils.”

 Change of plan in appointment of teachers, with
definition of eligibility.

 ‘Teachers desiring positions in the Holyoke schools shall
make their applications to the superintendent, preferably on blanks
which will be furnished for that purpose.”

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  

 ‘Candidates for appointment in the High School must
present equivalence of graduation in some reputable college.”’

‘Candidates for appointment below the High School (graduates
of the Holyoke Training School excepted) must present equivalence
of graduation in the Holyoke High School and also equivalence of
graduation in one of the Massachusetts state normals. Candidates
for first primary grades should also present some knowledge of the
principles and practices of the kindergarten.”

‘Candidates for appointment in the kindergartens must
present equivalence of high school graduation and also two years’
successful training in some reputable kindergarten normal.”

‘* Candidates for appointment as supervisors must give evidence
of eminent preparation in higher schools devoted to specialized
training, and of pronounced success in other high standard schools.”

“These requirements shall not apply to teachers now in the
Holyoke schools, but such teachers shall make advance preparation
as the superintendent may designate.”

 ‘To determine the equivalence of specified requirements
governing the eligibility of teachers, the superintendent shall
arrange two regular examinations, to be held the second weeks of
May and December, for such applicants as desire to give evidence
of equivalence in qualifications. He may also arrange special
examinations of applicants at time and place subject to his
discretion.”

 ‘As specified in the statutes of the Commonwealth,
every teacher, prior to entering upon the duties of the school, must
obtain from the school committee certificate in duplicate of his
qualifications.”

 ‘*The superintendent shall make all nominations of
teachers, presenting, for the confirmation of the board, the name
of single candidate for each position to be filled. In case a
candidate so nominated is rejected, the matter will be considered
referred back to the superintendent for another nomination.”

 “When teacher is appointed prior to the regular meeting in June, such appointment shall terminate at the close of the
school year then current.”

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

‘‘At the regular meeting of the board in June, the teachers for
the ensuing school year, so far as is practicable, shall be appointed.
The board may, however, at any time remove any teacher when in
its judgment the best interests of the school demand. Within ten
days of the receipt of notice of appointment, teacher shall file a
written acceptance, otherwise the position will be vacant. A
teacher in resigning must give one month’s notice.”

 ‘The assignments and transfers of teachers shall be at
the discretion of the superintendent.”

 Provision whereby teachers may, without loss of pay, be
absent on account of personal illness, or on account of death of
certain members of immediate family.

 Provision for appointment of three regular substitute
teachers so that the schools may be supplied with experienced
workers on days of absence of teachers, and particularly that
schools need not be dismissed on days of visitation of teachers to
other schools.

 Prohibition of book agents, advertisements and collections in the schools.

 ‘The number of pupils assigned to single teacher ina
primary or grammar school shall not exd forty; in the High
School, twenty-five in the ninth grade, thirty.”

  Regulation of admission of pupils outside regular
district.

 The auditorium in any school building shall not be
used for any purpose not of educational value.”’

 Definition of duties of janitors.

There were also some other but minor modifications of previous
rules; but this resume indicates all the characteristic changes.

The new rules have all been in satisfactory operation during
the year, with no amendment or deviation. The main purpose of
the new rules was the centralization of responsibility and the entire
removal of the schools from the environments of politics. Undoubtedly so radical change as this naturally centralizes more or
less criticism on the one charged with such responsibility, but the

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE. 
change has worked good to the schools. Plans, similar in effect to
these, have been in operation in the schools of Cleveland, Ohio,
for several years, have lately been adopted in New York City, and
are being favorably considered in Boston. The committee recommends no change. .

In order that book may be authorized for use in our schools
the rules require it must be recommended by the superintendent

Study. Following this, notice of such proposed authorization must
be given at regular meeting of the Board one month, after which
the book may be placed on the authorized list, provided it receives,
at regular meeting, two-thirds vote of the entire School Committee. This rule applies to all text books and other supplementary
books of instruction; but it does not apply to teachers’ helps and
library books, which, however, must be approved by the Committee
on Text Books and Courses of Study.

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

The expenditures for text books during the past year have been
$ making total average cost of  for each pupil of
the average monthly membership of the schools, including the
evening schools; or of  without the evening schools. The
expenditures for text books, and other supplies classed as text
books, during the past five years have been as follows :—

TABLE XLVIII —COST OF TEXT BOOKS—BY YEARS.

 

A Mechershin®.  
Text Books,   
Per Capita Cost,*  

It will be readily seen from the above table of years that the
per capita cost for text books, maps and library books has been less
this year of than in any other year since  Necessarily
the computation of the membership of the school is made on the
average monthly membership of the school year ending June  ,
while the year of expenditures is for year of greater needs, ending
November  This does not make much difference ina city of
stationary conditions but ina city like Holyoke, where the increase
in the schools runs ten per cent or more in single year, it does
make difference. If the state reports on membership comprehended year identical with the fiscal year, then the cost of last
year would show less per capita expense.

Based on similarity of needs and proportionate increase of
pupils the same as last year, the situation would demand an apportionment of  for the text book supply of the coming year.
Your committee recommends that the appropriation be made
$ based on the following approximate estimates :—

* Not Including eveniog schools in calculation.

This would make the average per capita cost for text books,

The apportionment of the  estimated for the High
School is made as follows: English books, history, ;
science, mathematics,  German, French,  ;
Greek, Latin,  business department, .

COURSES OF STUDY.

During the past year no great change has been made in the
courses of study below the High School, but great deal has been
done toward the improvement and enrichment of existing work.

The opening of kindergartens has been attended with extension of the work of the schools in that direction, which has been
done through the usual work of kindergarten character.

In reading, number work, language, science, music and drawing, the Superintendent has sought to have the schools make more

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITEEE.

, progress in the early years of the course. For instance, in reading.
the pupils should be ready for the second reader by the beginning
of the second year; the third reader at the beginning of the third
year. Also in arithmetic, the slow work of pupils, dependent entirely
upon the limited work the teacher can place on the blackboard,
is giving way to more rapid progress resulting from the use of wellgraded books. So that the schools are in reality making more progress each successive year by the gradual elimination of waste
work, and by the presentation of work favorable to greater economy
of the child’s energy.

In writing, considerable change has been made by the introduction of vertical writing, concerning which report is made in the
statements of that committee. ,

The Superintendent has in preparation plans for very decided
improvement of the work in English all through the curricula, for
an intimation of which reference is made to the Superintendent’s
report.

Under the direction of Prof. Draper, head of the science
department of the High School, the science work of the lower
grades has been greatly improved. Laboratory tables and inexpensive apparatus have been placed in the ninth grades. By lessons
twice per week the pupils are being gradually introduced to scientific methods and manipulations, and are taught the exding value
of exact measurements and exact determinations, which cannot but
have happy influence over all the other work.

During the year considerable extension has been made of work
previously commenced along industrial lines. Through the regular
teachers and without great expense, manual training and sewing
have been finding their way into the schools with excellent results.
The principal and teachers are entitled to great credit for the work
already done in this department. With the coming of special
instructors for the conduct of manual training and domestic science
instruction in the High School, it is expected that such expert
instructors will also be available for direction of the work in lower
grades.

Elementary Latin has now been taught in the Appleton Street
Grammar School for two years. At regular meeting of the School

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
Committee held in September,  it was voted to make Latin
permissable in the ninth grade of the Appleton Street School, and
in any other ninth grade on petition of the patrons when supported
by the endorsement of the Superintendent. The Appleton School
ninth grade is the only one where Latin is being taught.

As will be seen by the report of the High School Committee,
the changes in the High School curricula have been quite radical.
Seven courses of study, with almost unlimited opportunity for substitution and modification, are at the choice of the capable pupil.
No matter for what college the student may be preparing, he here
finds plans adapted to his purposes. On the other hand, the pupil
who is not going to college is given the work that makes for him
the High School finishing school, or direct preparation for the
demands of business, social or home life. There is probably no
other High School in America presenting so many options for the
consideration of students and parents. Certainly these plans have
not reached maturity in single year, for the work commenced
necessarily in lower grades has not reached in full detail the higher
classes, and considerable abridgment has been necessary owing to
the inadequacies of the old building. The improvement, however,
is well shown by the remarkable holding of pupils within the school,
which is always the test of high merit in school plans. The High
School of to-day must reach larger numbers than the High School
of few years since. (See Report VII.)

The needs of the evening schools for improvement in both
course of study and text books are very pronounced. It is not
right to equip these schools of nearly adulf persons with the discarded baby books of the primary schools. These pupils have
some maturity of thought and very different English vocabulary.
At the present time there seems to be few books published, adapted
to the kind of work necessary in the elementary evening schools;
but careful attention .to this matter may lead to gradual equipment
of these schools with something better. ,

The course of study for the evening grammar school is necessarily tentative. The opening of this school awakened promising interest in very worthy young men and young women. The
work is all above the sixth grade standard, and much reaches into

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
the High School. Based on the results of this year, it is expected
that plans for still further improvement will be ready by the opening
of another term’s work.
Very respectfully submitted,

REPORT XI.
PRINTING AND SUPPLIES.

During the past year there have been expended: For printing
and advertising,  for typewriting, for educational
supplies, for building and janitors’ supplies, .

It has been the custom of the committee for many years to
authorize the Superintendent to make purchase of all supplies,
that are regular and established by the custom of the schools;
all special or unusual supplies are passed upon in advance, item
by item, by the committee. Every bill presented must show its
entire history, including the Superintendent’s authorization, and the
receipt of the receiving person, and is never presented to the
Finance Committee until it has previously been approved by the
chairman of the Committee on Supplies, or by special committee.
The fact that the blanks and practices of this committee have been
adopted by other departments of the city government is evidence
of the merit of the plan.

Previous to the year now closed the expenditures of the
department were not minutely classified, and the large contingent
expense of other years shows that many articles of educationa]
supplies were probably included in expenditures marked contingent.
Desiring that future committees should have closely figured data
on which to better equalize apportionments, the expenditures of
this year have been carefully classified. It can now be seen at a
glance what studies or buildings should be curtailed in costs and
wherein others should be better favored.

REPORT XII.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON
MUSIC.

The department of music should be one of the brightest in the
schools. ‘Through the music exercise there is ever the opportunity
for appeal to the nobler impulses of the soul, and it helps to glorify
all the other work of the schoolroom and of practical life. Not
only does it lift the student into higher atmosphere of worthy
resolve, but through the blending of voices and the harmony of correlated action it is powerful instrumentality in inculcating the
practice of the highest of all socialistic principles, that of relation,
interdependence and co-operation. Of great value in the teaching of these higher spiritual lessons, it also has its important
intellectual benefits. The nice discriminations in tone perception,
in time and rhythm, the exercises in concentration of thought, quick
observation of musical representations, interpretation of signs, the
translation of thought and expression of voice—all these through
the co-operation of eye, ear, voice and soul, afford mental training
which recognizes no superior. The fact that these higher, intellectual activities are not always utilized is no reason why they are
not possibilities.

Realizing this high and art side of musical instruction, the
committee felt that the needs of the schools demanded the employment of supervisor of music who could give his entire time to this

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

work. Prof. Friedrich Zutchmann, for twenty-two years in charge of
music in the Holyoke schools, and whose time was partly engaged
elsewhere, retired with the appreciation of his services on the part
of all concerned. Prof. Charles S. Cornell, formerly of St. Albans,
Vermont, but recently of Los Angeles, California, was appointed
supervisor of music, with employment for full time at salary of .
This change has made it possible for the supervisor to visit all the
schools every week, besides the daily direction of the entire High
School in chorus drill. Many teachers’ meetings have been held ;
the work is being closely supervised, as is shown in the printed program of visits to buildings the pupils have been well instructed, and
all have had the advantage of great ideals presented by the magnificent voice and singing of an artist supervisor. Month by
month the schools are showing rapid advancement in music, the
work is filled with enthusiasm, and the promise is that the
schools will surpass even their former reputation for excellence
in music.

The spirit of the supervisor's plan is to place before the schools
nothing but the best musical, selections. To that end there has
been gradual introduction of more leaflet music, particularly in the
High School. The schools are now working on music that would
do credit to choral societies. The value of this bringing children
to the study and appreciation of master thoughts cannot be too
strongly endorsed by the Committee on Music. There has been
some equipment of the schools with new books, but this has been
done by exchange, so that improvement in this line has been practically without cost to the committee.

Not the least of the good work being done by the supervisor
is the series of monthly recitals before the High School. These
recitals were planned as an education for the pupils of the school but
although held at the early hour of in the morning, they have
been attended by an appreciative audience of patrons and citizens,
that has taxed the galleries and standing room of Temperance
Hall to the utmost. ‘To keep the audiences within present building
limitations, these recitals will be continued at this early morning
hour, but when our high school moves into the new building and
the great auditorium is then available, it is probable these recitals

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
will be arranged to better meet this spontaneous demand which is
seeking to express itself. The Committee on Music wish to express
its satisfaction at the manner in which our Supervisor of Music,
through the schools within, and classic recitals and oratorio society
without, is seeking to uplift the entire community into high realm
of vocal music.

' During the past year the entire cost of music in the schools
has been: For instructors,  for books, charts and supplies,
$ total, making an average expense of twentyfive and one-half cents for each pupil coming directly under the
supervisor’s instruction.

The committee regrets that the schools are so poorly equipped
with musical instruments. At present time the schools own a
very excellent grand piano at the Nonotuck Street School, purchased by the pupils’ earnings ‘a grand piano at the High School
(badly used and out of repair) very old and inferior square
piano at the Appleton Street School square piano at the Hamilton Street Hall; and new upright piano at the Sargeant Street
School.

This last-named piano was won by the pupils of the Sargeant
Street School as result of voting contest, held by the //olyoke
Daily Democrat. The piano, without cost to the department,
was turned over to the school on condition that it should always
remain in the Sargeant Street School. .

The School Committee is also paying rent ($  per quarter
on each piano) for piano used in the West Street Kindergarten,
and for one used at the Hamilton Street Kindergarten. These pianos
are in the kindergartens, and are not of service in the general music
of the schools. During the past year this committee was authorized
to purchase piano for the West Street School Auditorium, but the
funds of the department were so low that it was thought best to defer action until the beginning of the next fiscal year. The committee recommends that the piano for the West Street Auditorium be purchased at once; that concert grand be purchased
at the proper time for the new High School Auditorium (for
this fund of  is already available), and that piano
also be purchased for the music room in the same building.

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
The old piano now belonging to the High School will be needed
in the gymnasium. There is also need of pianos at the other
large buildings.
Attention is called to the report of the Supervisor of Music,

presented in Section XIX of this Annual Report.

REPORT XIII.
DRAWING AND WRITING.

The Committee on Drawing and Writing expresses pleasure
at the general progress of the work in the schools, and ask the
consideration of the Board to the following discussions.

DEPARTMENT OF DRAWING.

This department is supervised by Mrs. Isabel H. Ferry, to
whose responsibility the work is charged. In execution of plans
she is assisted by Mrs. Rose A. Dougherty. As the official head of
the department, Mrs. Ferry is expected to keep pace with the rapid
growth of art education, to prepare plans for all the schools, to
personally instruct the advanced classes, and to give general supervision to the whole work. However, on account of the large
election of drawing by the pupils at the High School and the consequent heavy demands for class instruction there, Mrs. Ferry is
compelled to spend every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at the High School, making it impossible for her to personally
instruct any school excepting the Eighth and Ninth grades, which
she visits once per month. Teachers’ meetings are held every
second and fourth Tuesday. In execution of the Supervisor’s plans,
Mrs. Dougherty, the assistant, visits all the other rooms twice each
month, excepting the First and Second grades, where the visits are
once each month, and the rural schools less frequently. Under the
circumstances the work has been highly commendable, but condi  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

tions have presented great limitations. Drawing is subject that
cannot be supervised or taught with lessons few minutes long. It
requires time. The institute at the beginning of the year was of
incalculable benefit.

In view of the great burden of class work devolving on the
Supervisor under the present plan, the impossibility of holding sufficient meetings for the instruction of pupils, or properly supervising
the work, and in view also of the embarrassment to both the High
School plans and the general work because of such division and
confliction of responsibility, your committee would recommend a
change of plan, by which there shall be appointed at the next annual election supervisor who shall instruct teachers and personally
supervise the work, and teacher of drawing who shall be assigned
to the execution of plans in the High School.

During the past year the cost of the drawing department has
been: For salaries,  for material and supplies,  ;
total,  making the average per capita cost cents.

The committee desires to call attention to the report of the
Supervisor of Drawing. (See Report XIX.)

DEPARTMENT OF WRITING.

This department is under the direction of Miss Esther A.
MacDonnell. The rapid growth of the city and increase in schoolrooms have accumulated great deal of difficulty during the first
seven months of the year, making it impossible for the Supervisor
to visit the various schools oftener than once month; and even
then the first primary schools were omitted. In September, Miss
Katie J. MacDonnell was appointed assistant, with employment for
three days per week. Since then, the Supervisor has visited grades
Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight and Nine every third week, and
the assistant has visited grades One and Two twice per month.

During the last five or six years remarkable changes have been
made in this country in school systems of writing. Massachusetts
schools, almost without exception, have changed from the timeREPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
honored slant writing to vertical script. Your committee gave this
important matter very careful attention, taking full year for examination and, as result, vertical writing, with the unanimous
consent of the School Committee, was introduced into all grades
below the High School.

The arguments that influenced the committee to this decision
might be briefly stated as follows.::—

 Vertical writing had its first advocacy among physicians and
physiologists. It requires an evenly-balanced position of the body
and tends to hold the writer in more upright posture. It maintains uniform focal distance for both eyes. The letters being
larger, simpler and bolder in form, the strain of manuscript work
becomes less exacting to the eye. It follows more logical development of the physical child, appealing more to the larger
brain areas and not so much to over-constraint through exercises
on matters of minute detail.

 Vertical writing is much more easily acquired than
slant writing, as has been abundantly proven by this year’s experience. The progress that has been made by the younger children and those of the more advanced grades has been remarkable.
The greatest difficulty in the transition has been in grades Three
and Four, but that is being rapidly overcome. It has been interesting to note that many pupils who formerly accomplished miser- 
able results in penmanship have found new life in vertical script,
which appears so much more natural.

 Thethird element of virtue in the new system is its
extreme simplicity. Every superfluous movement is discarded. It
is an approximation of print. This gives it great legibility,
which is of the utmost importance, and is highly appreciated by
the teachers, who must examine much examination manuscript, as
it doubtless will be by others who read the children’s writing.

A very interesting result appeared in the evening grammar
school. ‘There the pupils were not required to conform to the newer
form, but were given copy books in which vertical text gave the
words to be written. The pupils were told to use any system they

" REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

desired, for it was not thought best to attempt to change the
crystalized forms of pupils who averaged fully twenty years
of age. Strange to say, the entire school readjusted itself
to the vertical script, great interest and enthusiasm developed in
the work, and drill in the new writing became one of the most
favored exercises of the school; so that now, at the end of two
months’ schooling, some of the bookkeeping manuscript of the
evening grammar school ranks high as works of art in the Holyoke
schools.

The Committee on Writing is pleased with the results in
writing during the first term of this year, and desire to congratulate the Supervisor, and the teachers and pupils, on the high
excellence of the work attained in very few weeks of time.

The cost of the Department of Writing during the past year
has been: For special teachers, for books and supplies,
$ total, This makes an average cost of cents
to each pupil of the primary and grammar grades of the schools.

Attention is called to the report of the Supervisor of Writing.

MANUAL TRAINING AND KINDERGARTENS.

The past ten years have been marked by very pronounced
and growing sentiment in favor of more industrial education. In
consequence of this, drawing now occupies prominent place in
the curricula of to-day kindergarten instruction has become part
of the work of the best public schools; and manual training, by the
Statutes of the Commonwealth, is now made compulsory in high
schools in all cities of over population.

KINDERGARTENS.

The kindergarten is now recognized as possible and powerful factor in the solution of the great socialistic and civic problem
of the country. It takes the child at an earlier age and utilizes
educational opportunities otherwise largely lost. It bridges the
distance between the home and the primary school and creates a
home for many. It trains the child to keen observation, to ability
to handle himself to advantage, and to the recognition of his relation to others and to the harmony of universal law. It develops
creative faculty, critical judgment and quickness in thought. The
result of kindergarten training is, the child better prepared for
adjustment of himself to the duties of the regular school, and better
able because of trained observation, quicker thought and ready

  REPORT OF SCHOOL CUMMITTEE. .
manipulation, to do the work of the school in less time than without
such preparation.

Not in advance of the times, but following the established
custom of other first-class schools, Holyoke has this year made a
beginning in kindergarten instruction. Without changing the
school age, kindergartens were opened in September in the West
Street School, the Appleton Street School and the Hamilton Street
School, making one in each general district. The adopted salaries
have been: For director,  per month; for assistant,  per
month. The enrollment has been: West Street kindergarten,  
pupils; Appleton Street kindergarten,  Hamilton Street

kindergarten,  .

Your committee recommends :— |

 That these three kindergartens be continued.

 That pupils be admitted in September who become five
years of age before January  st; and in April rst, all who become
five years of age before September rst.

 That, beginning with April rst, an afternoon session be
opened in kindergartens already equipped, for entering pupils, provided there is assurance of thirty additional pupils for which additional work directors shall receive  per month extra and
assistants  per month extra.

 Your committee calls attention to the desirability of opening
kindergartens in the North Chestnut, South Chestnut, Nonotuck,
E]mwood, Sargeant, Lyman and Springdale schools, but opposes the
opening of kindergartens in rented rooms or to the inconvenience
of regular schools. The committee thinks three of these kindergartens can be well added in September and would so recommend.

The adoption of these recommendations would increase the
cost of the city’s kindergartens  for the year  making the
total amount to be appropriated for such salaries, .

The reports of neighboring cities just received show the
following costs of kindergartens for the year now ending. No
doubt nearly all of these cities are planning enlargements for the
year  .

MANUAL TRAINING.

On the fourteenth day of June,  the Legislature passed
an act providing that after the first day of September,  every
city of or more inhabitants, shall maintain, as part of its
High School system, the teaching of manual training, the course to
be pursued in such instruction to be subject to the approval of the
State Board of Education. The State Board of Education has
issued abundant instructions and suggestions concerning this work
(see Report pages to  ). Other cities have
hastened to meet the requirements of the law and have now passed
the special cost of first equipment.

Holyoke for three years has escaped this added expense to the
regular budget, but the completion of our new High School before
September tst gives no further excuse for evading the law. Manual
training must have its place in our curriculum September rst. Fortunately the funds for the expense of the first year’s equipment,
($ are now on hand; but provision must be made for a
teacher in the wood-working department and teacher of domestic

science, including cooking and sewing. In order to provide for
this required instruction, it will be necessary to add to the salary
estimates of the High School the sum of  for the running
expenses of September, October and November.

For plan of work in the mechanic’s arts and domestic science
departments, see report of the High School Committee and also
the High School Bulletin.

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

While industrial education is required in the High School, the
law makes it permissive in the lower grades. Doubtless good
deal of valuable industrial education will be engrafted on the work
of the lower grade schools as soon as we have present at
the High School special instructor who can give such
work its proper direction but considerable has already been done
by energetic teachers without such help. The Hamilton Street
School has had system of sloyd instruction in operation, with
some surprisingly good results. The Elmwood School has also
introduced sloyd during the past year. In sewing, good beginning has been made in the Hamilton Street, the Park Street, the

. West Street, the Nonotuck, the Elmwood and the South Chestnut
‘schools. The time given to such work is one hour per week.
The cost is very inexpensive, the entire cost for the past year being:
For sloyd,  for sewing, .

. REPORT XV.

HEALTH AND PHYSICAL CULTURE.

Your committee regrets that regard for the proper physical
training of our school children is each year being encroached on
more and more by unfavorable conditions. With constantly
growing number of pupils, we still have only one specially trained
teacher in charge of this work. Our schools are in many instances
so crowded that proper places for such exercises are impossible.
At the High School the work has been necessarily omitted, owing
to the conversion of the High School hall into small recitation
rooms. The entire cost of this department during the year has
been making an average cost to each participating child in
the day schools of cents. Even without the High School,
the Supervisor has time for only twenty visits to each building
per year.

From the report of the Truant Officers the following information
is learned concerning the contagious diseases that have affected
the schools.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  

Your committee desire to call your earnest attention to the
following statements, suggestions and recommendations :—

 We deplore that so little is done toward better sanitary
provisions in some of our schoolhouses. The Lyman, Ewingville,
South Chestnut and Sargeant Street schools, have practically no
ventilation whatever. The closet systems in the Nonotuck, Elmwood, Bridge, Hamilton, Dwight and Springdale schools are very
bad indeed, and merit the condemnation of all persons interested
in the cleanliness, good health, and good morals of school children.
The basement of the Springdale School is covered with mould,
which may be the source of disease at any time. In several of the
buildings the walls have not been purified for many years. Frequent
kalsomining would be very desirable.

 We disapprove of schools in tenement rooms. Whilesuch
rooms are costly in dollars and cents, the greatest cost is in sacrificing
the good health of children. Tenement schools have no ventilation,

miserable light, and poor sanitaries. health examination of
pupils in these rooms at the end of the year would probably reveal
 some surprisingly bad results.

 We approve of the recent introduction of adjustable furniture, on the score of health and economy. Pupils in these rooms
should be measured at least once per term, and their desks and
chairs adjusted accordingly. Of course, the city cannot afford the
expense of such equipment of rooms excepting as new ones are
formed but we would commend the Boston practice of gradually
placing one row of adjustable furniture in each room for the accommodation of overgrown or defective children.

  Weregret that the membership in many of the rooms is so
greatly in excess of the maximum number recommended by
the Board in Rule  .

 s. We commend the Superintendent’s desire to gradually
equip the windows of the schoolrooms with translucent curtains,
admitting light purely white, in large quantities, and from higher
level.

 We commend also the abolition of slates, the use of indi  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

vidual drinking cups and individual towels. We are glad to see the
greater use of soap and disinfectants, and the high degree of cleanliness characterizing the most of our school buildings.

 We regret that few of our buildings have basement play- rooms for the use of pupils on stormy days; and that, with better
ventilation of rooms by overhead registers, we are losing the
opportunity to dry the feet and clothing on days of wet weather.
The Fitchburg plan of granting the truant officers few hundred
dollars for the purchase of overshoes for poor children might be
worthy of consideration. .

 We would recommend that some inexpensive plan be
adopted, whereby there shall be an annual examination of the
eyesight and hearing of pupils, and health examination of all
special cases reported by teachers. We commend the Superintendent’s desire to keep health record of each child, and hope
facilities will be given him to put such plan into practice. The
Boston and the Brookline movement by which competent physicians
visit school buildings daily, in case of flag signal, is suggested for
consideration.

g. We appreciate the gratuitous services of our truant ofhcers in the quarantining of diseases and labeling buildings of contagious diseases with danger cards; but we raise the question as
to whether it is proper for these officers, who must mingle daily

 with thousands of children, to expose themselves to the danger of
carrying contagion.

 We recommend that teachers be instructed to more
careful observation of the direction given by the Supervisor of
Physical Training.

 We recommend that the Supervisor’s request for light
apparatus for the West Street School be granted.

 We recommend that some inexpensive form of paper
cover for text books be adopted, whereby the possible danger incident to the transfer of books at the close of the year may be
lessened. |

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  !
 Werecommend that physical training in the High School
be resumed as soon as the new building is entered; and that a
thoroughly trained lady teacher, who is also qualified to make careful health examinations and to teach physiology, be placed in charge
of the girls’ gymnasium.

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

The Committee on Salaries calls attention to the following facts
shown by the preceding tables :—

 Boston, Worcester, New Bedford, Springfield, Holyoke,
Newton and Brookline each pay their superintendent salary of
$  or more but in Holyoke the superintendent is also secretary
of the School Committee and is given little special assistance.

 The scale of salaries paid Holyoke supervisors is comparitively not large.

 The salaries paid teachers in the Holyoke High School are
Jess than the average salaries of Massachusetts high schools.

 The salaries paid principals of the Holyoke schools are
less than the average salaries of principalships in Massachusetts
cities.

 The salaries paid experienced grade teachers in the Holyoke schools are about the same as those of other Massachusetts
cities; but the salaries paid teachers before they have reached

, graduated experience are greater. If the salaries of teachers of
incomplete experience were reduced to the Springfield scale there
would be saving of about  per annum. The committee is
not in favor of less compensation for experienced teachers. We
suggest that entering and inexperienced teachers might be started
on less salary and advanced more gradually.

 The salaries paid our kindergarten teachers are less than
the average.

 Table LXIV shows that Holyoke deals generously in compensation of janitors.

The committee regrets that the adopted scale of salaries tends
to the development of sentiment among the teachers that there is
no promotion excepting as teachers pass from the lower to the
higher grades. This tends in particular to impoverish the work in
some of the first primary schools, where the need of experienced
and cipable teachers is specially important. We would therefore
recommend that only experienced teachers be placed in the first

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
grade, and that the salaries for this grade be made sufficient to hold
our best primary teachers in such positions.

While we are not in favor of increase in salaries excepting in
cases of unusual fitness, nevertheless we express our pleasure at the
superior worth of some of the educators who now honor the teaching force of Holyoke, and we hope that none of these will be permitted to leave the city.

Respectfully submitted,
EDWARD N. WHITE,
DANIEL F. DONOGHUE,
ODILON Z. E. CHAREST,
Committee on Salaries.

REPORT XVII.
- REPORT OF THE FINANCE
COMMITTEE.

Our schools are passing through period of growth and development. During the past year the enrollment of pupils has increased
eleven percent. the operation of State law makes certain demands ;
the spirit throughout the cities of the entire country is one of
advancement and progress; we have reached point of natural
increase in necessities, owing to the opening of the new West Street
Grammar school, the reconstruction of the High School preparatory to entrance to our new building, the conversion of the Training and Practice School into regular school; and we have been
forced to meet extraordinary expenses forced upon us in rents,
double costs of tenement schools, power, etc., etc. In view of
these natural factors operating to increase the cost of maintenance,
the affairs of the school department have been conducted with great
economy. There have been increases in running expenses, but an
examination of the following tables will show that these increases
are in items over which the committee has little, if any, control.
Indeed in all accounts subject to contro] there have been important
reductions, perhaps more than should have been made for the best
interests of the schools.

RECEIPTS.

The estimates furnished by the school department to the city
government for expenses of the year ending November ,
called for The appropriation was made ,
which amount has been subject to the expenditure of the School
Committee. In addition to this, there has been received during

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
the year: From dog tax, tuition and sales, making
total appropriation and receipts of During the
year, by mutual agreement, there was transferred from the credit of
the School Committee to the credit of the Board of Public
Works,  making the net amount available for the purposes of the School Committee, Besides this
there was appropriated  for the furnishing and expenses of
the new High School, but this can not be used for current expenses.

The expenditures of  even with all the improvements and
enforced necessities of the year, show an increase of only eleven
per cent. over  In view of the circumstances stated at the
beginning of this report, this increase is very little indeed, particularly when it is remembered that the number of pupils has increased
in corresponding ratio.

* The cost of educational supplies In should not be compared with other veare for
the reason that the classification is clorer, and less now charged to the miscellaneous
and contingentaccount. The committee approves the desire of the Superintendent to
eliminate lump contingent account,

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  

TABLE LXVII.—CLASSIFICATION OF EXPENDITURES.
The expenditures of the School Department may be classified
as Fixed Charges over which the committee has very little control, and Charges under Control and subject to some adjustment.

it has been prepared, it will tell its own story of the systematic
economy with which the management of our schools has been
conducted.

The Finance Committee calls attention to the system of books
which the Superintendent has had specially prepared for keeping
the accounts of the school department. The books show at a
glance, and at any time, the entire financial condition of the
schools, and yet with such careful classification that the committee can tell at once just where expenditures should be checked
or favored. These books and accounts are open at all times to
persons desirous of knowing the condition of the schools’ finances.

REPORT XVIII.
SUPERINTENDENT’S REPORT.

The past year has been an important one in the history of the
schools. The population of the city and the school census have
increased comparatively little, but the number of pupils has increased more than ten per cent. The School Committee, the
principals and the teachers have all been very earnest in desire and
co-operation for the advancement of the schools. The general
work has shown gradual improvement, in some cases slow, in others
more rapid. The changes in the High School in the partial
reorganization of the teaching force, in the introduction of better
methods, in the liberality of the courses of study, and in the
enrichment of the student’s opportunity have been very decided.
The kindergartens have been successfully inaugurated. Special
emphasis has been placed, in all the schools, on improvement of
the work in English. The pupils have been granted more
generous introduction to the pleasures of science and nature
studies. Manual training and sewing have been finding their way
more and more into the schools. Vertical writing, in few short
weeks, has shown its superior merits. The music instruction in the
schools has been greatly enriched, while the study of art has
received great impetus. Perhaps in no instance has the improvement been more marked than in the evening schools, where, however, the work is yet by no means what it should be. Altogether,
the tone of the year’s work has been healthy and progressive. The
results have not all been equally pronounced; but they have
probably been as good as circumstances have permitted. In many
imstances they represent beginnings, which are not expected to

s lh ow development and realization for some time to come.

By the preceding table it will be seen that there have been
forty-eight positions filled by appointments during the time of the
present administration. ‘These may be classified as follows :—

Three supervisorships: resident appointments,  non-resident,  .

Three principalships: resident,  non-resident,  .

Nine High School positions: residents,  non-residents,  .

Twenty-six grade positions: residents,  non-residents,  .

Six kindergarten positions: residents, none available; nonresidents,  .

NOMINATION OF TEACHERS.

All things being the same, it has been the Superin'endent’s
purpose and plan to name teachers from home candidates. However, schools are intended for the best education of the children,
and not primarily for giving persons employment. ‘Therefore,
when places of special responsibility and special needs have called
for special consideration, the Superintendent has not hesitated to
place the entire country under tribute to the schools. It will be

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

seen that two of the three supervisorships have been filled by home
teachers; one of the three principalships two of the nine High
School teachers and twenty-one of the twenty-six grade positions.
The six kindergarten positions have all been filled by non-residents,
for the reason that there were no resident applicants of the required
kindergarten training. No doubt, the kindergartens being established, graduates of our home schools will now be encouraged
to take the two-years’ course of normal training; so that in time
we will not need to seek elsewhere to so large an extent.

Under the rules which now confine the election of teachers to
persons nominated by the Superintendent, the following positions
of special responsibility have been filled :—

Principalship of the Hugh School. For this position Mr.
Charles H. Keyes was named and elected. Mr. Keyes is an educator of large administrative experience. graduate of St. John’s
College, he has had advantages of post-graduate work at the University of California and at Clark University. Experienced in high
school principalship and city superintendency, he had also won his
way to the front as president of Throop Polytechnic Institute of
Passadena, Cal., one of the foremost institutions of its kind in
America. As one of the managers of the Educational Exhibit at
the World’s Fair of  as an orator and lecturer of wide reputation, as member of the National Council of Education and of its
Executive Committee, as president of the Manual Training section
of the National Association, as institute instructor, high school
principal, city superintendent and college president, Mr. Keyes
commended himself to the Superintendent as an educator who had
no superior among the high school principals of Massachusetts,
and, without candidacy on his part, was invited to take the charge
of our High School. The high success of the year and the promise

| of still greater realization have abundantly demonstrated the value
of this choice.

Supervisor of Music. Realizing that the time had come when
the needs of our schools demanded the entire time of director of
music, the Superintendent sought to combine the following qualities
in the new appointment: man who would cast his whole weight,

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
influence and residence identity, for the up-building of Holyoke; a
supervisor who is, first of all, an artist of thorough training, acquaintance with the best musical literature and with musicians, and of
voice that would be an inspiration to both teachers and pupils; and
a musical director who could lead the singers of the city toward
great ideals and unite them in organizations and festivals for the
highest development of the community’s culture. As such supervisor, Mr. Charles S. Cornell, formerly of St. Albans, Vt., but more
recently of Los Angeles, Cal., was named. The tremendous energy,
artistic fire and over fidelity with which Mr. Cornell has thrown him- |
self into the work, as exemplified by his immense program of daily
work, his presentation of classic recitals, his preparation of the community for music festivals and his willingness to help in all public
gatherings, are all evidences of the superior work of the man.
Flead of the Science Department. For this important position
Mr. Jason T. Draper was nominated. Mr. Draper is graduate of
the Chauncey Hall and Boston University and post-graduate of
Harvard University. Like the Supervisor of Music, Mr. Draper
went from New England several years ago, at the call of the Superintendent to engage in the school work of western cities, and now
returns, thoroughly tried and thoroughly known, for co-operation
in the Holyoke work. Since his coming the interest in science has .
been intensified. The choice of science work on the part of pupils
really demands three or four teachers, where formerly was only one.
Valuable instruction has been given to the teachers for the direction
of the science work of the lower grades. scholar of unusual
training, teacher of ripe experience, an original worker of model
methods, Mr. Draper will enter upon the laboratory work of the
new building in way that will attract much attention from the
educators of other schools.
flead of the Classical Department. Fortunate indeed was

the Superintendent in finding so superior man as Mr. Edmund D.
Scott for the leadership of this department. Mr. Scott is graduate of Yale, and post-graduate of three years’ study and an
instructor at the same university. Subsequently, as student of
the American Classical School at Rome, he added to his superior

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

training and made valuable collections for illustration of the work of
his department. It would be difficult to find man better equipped
for the direction of the classical studies of high schools than Mr Scott.
He is prepared to make dead things breathe with living interest.

Head of the Department of Modern Languages. Another
appointment demonstrating its own fitness is that of Mr. Maro S.
Brooks. Mr. Brooks is graduate of ‘Tufts College and comes
from five years’ experience in charge of modern languages in Westminister School, an institute preparatory to Yale. Thorough college training, study abroad for two years, and successful experience
have well prepared him for his present work. student of ora- tory, Mr. Brooks has rendered important service in the literary
society work of the High School. Heisavaluable man and should
not be permitted to leave us.

Head of the Department of Business Training. Mr. M. H.
Sullivan was called to this position. Mr. Sullivan is graduate of
the Westfield Normal School. For several years in charge of the
practice department of Childs’s Business College, this city, he is
essentially Holyoke man. His department is doing as well as
the building limitations of the year permit.

Head of the Department of History. For this ‘position Mr.

‘ Charles A. Andrews was named. Of previous experience in the
schools, Mr. Andrews’ work is well known. He is graduate of
Amherst.

Principalship of the Dwight Street’ School. Mr. Henry W.
Kirmayer was nominated for this principalship. Mr. Kirmayer
is graduate of the Bridgewater Normal, where his father for many
years has been distinguished professor. Well trained and  prepared for his work, Mr. Kirmayer’s first year is proving very successful. He was called from the principalship of grammar school
at Rockland, Mass.

Princtpalship of the Park Street School. The transformation
of the Park Street School from normal training and model practice school to regular school made this appointment one of great
difficulty. Miss Jennie Ic. Scolley, for many years teacher in the
Hamilton Street School, was named for this principalship. The

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
result has fully met the most sanguine expectations. The Park
Street School is doing well.

Instructor in History and English. This appointment was
filled by Miss Rose M. Barton, who resigned the principalship of a
large grammer school at Fair Haven to accept the call. Miss
Barton is graduate of Cornell University, and is worth much more
to the schools than her salary of this year shows.

Instructor in Mathematics and English. Vhis position has
been acceptably filled by Miss Helen M. Slade, graduate of Vassar
College and formerly teacher in the Marlborough High School.

Instructor in Latin, Miss Maude A. Bonner received the call
as first assistant in Latin. Miss Bonner ts graduate of high honor
at Brown University, where she also assisted as temporary instructor.

Instructor tn English. Following the resignation of Miss
Turner, who because of sickness was able to stay only few weeks
in the school, Miss Jeannette S. Wendell was named as instructor in
English. Miss Wendell received special training in English at
Radcliffe College and also spent several years in study abroad.

Assistant Supervisor of Writing. Following the decision of
the School Committee to grant an assistant to the supervisor of
writing, Miss Katie J. MacDonald was nominated for three days
of service per week. Miss MacDonald is also supervisor of
writing in the South Hadley schools.

Concerning several of the preceding highly responsible appointments, perhaps it would be well to say that acceptances were made
on the expectation of more adequate salary recognition after the
value of services was demonstrated. In several instances the Superintendent made nominations for first year’s services at less salary
than the committee authorized, believing that the city would do its
duty by capable instructors. After the difficult constructive work

of the past year it would be unfortunate indeed if any of these capable
instructors should be taken from us, particularly at time when
they are very much needed. As it is, some ot them have left larger
salaries to come for participation in the presentation of representative methods; but they should not be expected to work for less
than their worth to the community.

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
OTHER DAY SCHOOL NOMINATIONS.

The other nominations made by the Superintendent, since the
passage of the new rules, will abundantly speak for themselves:
West Holyoke School, Mr. Fred L. Hooker; Ingleside School, Mr.
Thomas McCoy; Grammar Schools, Misses Rhoda A. Cook, Margaret E. Dixon, Katie A. Welch, Mary Sullivan; Primary and Intermediate schools, Misses Mabel C. Perkins, Margaret M. Green,
Clara M. Fuller, Delia M. Reilley, Katherine McCarthy, A. Belle
Smith, Katherine E. Browne, Katherine C. Scolley, Mary M.
Schmitter, Katherine A. Gleason; Kindergartners, Mary H.
Batchelder, Florence E. Goddard, Mabel S. Fuller, Grace H. Wagner, Mary H. Powers and Harriet D. Foster. )

While the nomination of teachers has been placed in his hands
by the rules of the School Board, the Superintendent has always
endeavored in advance to advise the proper district committee of
the nomination in contemplation. In many instances valuable
advice has been given; but, to the credit of the School Committee
be it said, no member has ever attempted to dictate to or to influence the Superintendent in the nomination of teachers, beyond
a mere statement of the qualifications of strong candidate, the
same as is the priviledge of any other citizen, and no disappointment has been expressed when it has been thought best to nominate
some other person. The Superintendent desires to express to the
members of the School Committee his sincere thanks and appreciation of the freedom from embarrassment granted him in this particular. The schools have been absolutely free from political obligations and the payment of personal favors.

EVENING SCHOOL APPOINTMENTS.

The evening school appointments are still made by the nomination of the Committee on Evening Schools, but the committee
has honored the Superintendent with close consultation so the
appointments are each year improving in general quality; although
no doubt, with the hundreds of applicants pressing for consideration, some very superior persons may have not been recognized.
At the beginning of this season the candidates were much sifted by

|

, REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
a meagre examination given those unable to show the equivalence
of high schoo] graduation. It would be well if this examination
should be made to apply to all appointments of the evening
schools, as it is almost impossible to discriminate justly between
schools the graduates of which ask for exemption. This examination would do much to protect the committee from the enormous
and embarrassing pressure every year exerted by candidates for

appointment in the evening schools.

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

A study of the preceding table, compiled from recent statistics
furnished by the superintendents of other cities, should entirely
free the Superintendent from the charge that he has not been regardful of the candidacy of home teachers. The Superintendent believes
in the encouragement of home teachers and expects to do his part
in their equitable consideration. He regrets, however, to see home
graduates narrow down their chances of high success in life to the
limited confines of one city; for the teacher, above all persons,
needs acquaintance with the world, contact with the methods of
other schools and the enrichment of mind that comes from versatile
surroundings. On the other hand, most school men, as exemplified
also by the above table, believe that the best school is made by the
fresh blood of many schools; that the school where the pupil of
one teacher becomes the teacher of another pupil and that pupil
the teacher of another, all in the same school system, inbreeds its
own weakness and fails to reach that high degree of proficiency

and suggestiveness where the best thought, the best blood and the
best experiences of many schools are all made to contribute to the
enrichment of the child’s opportunity. It must be ever remembered that the school is, first of all, for the child and not primarily
for the employment of teachers. Unfortunate indeed is any community where the employment of teachers degenerates into the
recognition that some have claim on the city fora livelihood. This
statement does not mean that the home candidate will not have full
consideration, for it is probable that the nomination of teachers
will still be confined to the home supply more largely than is the
case in other cities; but it would be very interesting to know just
which schools in Massachusetts are the very best and then to study
their practices in the choice of teachers.

VISITATION OF TEACHERS.

Directly in connection with this thought that school should be
enriched by the teacher’s versatile knowledge of the methods and
practices of many schools, this general criticism might be placed on
the Holyoke teachers: they do not visit other schools as they
should. Our school committee is very generous in this particular
and provides that any teacher may have one day eachterm, withREPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
out loss of pay, for the visitation of representative schools, during
which time substitute is furnished at the city’s expense. Comparatively few of our teachers avail themselves of this opportunity,
in some special cases for very good reasons. ‘The following table,
illustrating this point, may be of very great interest :—

This criticism should be tempered somewhat, for often the

but perhaps mistaken motive. From true spirit of fidelity, she
feels she serves her school best by being regularly at her post of

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
duty. Although permitted and encouraged to visit, she feels the
frown of the community is on such absence, and she does not like
the necessity for the apology which often must be made to those who
do not understand. Often the fact that experienced substitutes
are not available, deters her from asking for permission; and, even
if the substitute is experienced, she realizes no strange person can
do the work so well as herself. However this may be, the teacher
and the school need the enrichment brought only by an intimate
knowledge of the workings of other schools. The progress in
educational methods has been so pronounced that few teachers
can keep up with the times without such visiting. The best contributions of many schools are none too good for the work of any
one room. The teacher cannot afford not to visit. She must do it
in the interests of her school. This is particularly true in city
where the teachers are so largely those who have been educated in
the local schools. .
SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS.
But if all our teachers should avail themselves of their due
visiting privileges, the aggregate of absences from such cause would
be more than enough to occupy two regular substitutes. Again, the
rules of the School Committee generously provide that teachers
may be absent, without loss of pay, certain number of days,
because of personal sickness or because of the death of very near
relative. (See Rule  .) During the past year this in itself made
an aggregate of days of absence. For this and the preceding
reasons the rules of the School; Committee provide for the regular
election of three substitute teachers. The Superintendent has never
called for the election of but two of these regular substitutes, preferring to make the assignment in part by the employment of
special substitutes. As these absences of teachers do not evenly
distribute themselves throughout the two hundred days of the year,
it so happens that there are days when quite number of substitutes
are needed and then again, other days when the regular substitutes
can be used to assist in the office work.
There are some very just arguments why the regular substitute
plan should be continued. There is manifest advantage in having

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
at command those who are thoroughly acquainted with the work of
the schools, and who are ready for assignment at moment’s notice.
If teachers are to be encouraged to acquaint themselves with the
work of other schools by visiting, the regular force should be
increased rather than diminished. Great difficulty during the past
year has been in finding substitutes qualified for higher grammar
work and for high school, and even in finding others who could
take up the regular teachers’ work just where it is left off. Without the thoroughly qualified substitute, but little is done during
the absence of the regular teacher, except to encourage the pupils
to demoralization. In such cases it would be far better to dismiss
the school. If the community had the means to equip its schools
properly, it would be far better to place fixed regular substitute in
each of the larger buildings, who would know the pupils and the
character of each teacher’s work, and who could be of valuable
service on days of no teacher’s absence in specially helping backward
and other needy pupils. This plan your Superintendent has tried
elsewhere with excellent results.

ADVANCEMENT OF TEACHERS.

The quality of school is always determined by what the community does for the teacher’s advancement. The teacher who has
no great ambition for future promotion will do little more than
keep school and draw pay. For this reason am not in sympathy
with our present scaled schedule governing the salaries of teachers, |
which, however, is similar to the schedules of most Massachusetts
cities. Under this rule an inexperienced teacher of the lower
schools gets  the first year,  the second year and 

after five years, (Grade VII,  Grade VIII, Grade IX,
# ). The operation of this rule is not good. The objections to
it are as follows :—

 It recognizes no special fitness, preparation or faithfulness.

All teachers are paid alike, the only requisite being that of age.
After teacher passes certain limit there is no premium whatever
paid on special interest or special preparation. The teacher who
does barely enough to hold down her place is paid just as much as

@  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
the one who spends all her energies and money in advanced preparation. The problem of how to get rid ofa faithful teacher who
has outdated her usefulness in school, is always perplexing
problem and yet there are teachers of this kind, just inside the line
of consideration, who are paid more salary than some enthusiastic, modernly trained:and energetic young teachers whose services
are worth three times as much to the schools. With no recognition
whatever of special ability, and no premium for uncommon endeavor,
teachers in the course of mechanical time reach certain scaled salary and have all their ambition and high resolve stunted by the level; ing process of uniformity. That some teachers do keep alive their
youthful fire is to their high credit but all are not missionaries.

 The schedule does not recognize the fact that the burdens
of work are very different in different schools. teacher of  
pupils in one school is paid just as much as teacher of in another. (See Table IV.) The premium in this case is on the ability
ofa teacher to get snap.

 The entire spirit of the scale establishes dangerous sentiment that there can be no promotion, excepting as teacher passes
from lower grade to higher. This tends to impoverish the
primary schools where, in fact, we need the very best of teachers.
The transfer of teacher from lower to an upper grade almost
always lowers the standard of work in the room to which she sucds; while on the other hand, the best way to lift backward
school is by placing there teacher whose ideals belong to the next
higher grade. In consequence of this unfortunate trend of promotion idea many of our schools spend ten years in doing work
which should be done in eight.

These three objecticns are serious ones and would not be permitted to obtain in any business organizations except schools.

While have no reason to expect school community, governed by complex conditions, will be disposed to radically change
its plan of grading teachers’ salaries, do not hesitate to state my
convictions as to the desirability of some plan of better influence
on the schools. therefore present for consideration three plans,
each of which has certain distinguishing merits.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  

 PLAN SCALED ON EXCELLENCE.—This plan contemplates the
classification of teachers into five classes, known possibly as A, B,
C, and E, and recognized with salaries scaled as follows: Class A,
$ Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E,
$ In determination of the class of teacher, five points might
be taken into consideration:  health; scholarship;  specific
training  natural ability  professional spirit. To this might
be added the element, success in the schoolroom, but this is the
natural consequence of the five factors mentioned. Of course,
inexperienced teachers would be assigned to the lowest class. ‘The
operation of such plan would necessarily be vested in an executive head in whom there was the utmost confidence, or in small
Committee on Qualifications, from whose decision there could be
no appeal. Supposing school system of grade teachers was
graded the first year approximately with teachers in Class B,  
in Class C, in Class D, and in Class E, which would be about
the aggregate salaries of our present scale, what would be the resultant effects? Teachers would feel there was premium placed
on good work over mediocrity there would be an added incentive
for advanced study, special preparation, attendance on professional
gatherings and general excellence. The dead line would be largely
eliminated. Should teacher be rated low in salary it would be
because of fault in herself, for which there might be future amendment. Strong teachers could be assigned places where the work
was heavy, or where might be special need, without reference to
grade or years of doubtful experience. Promotion could come to a
teacher just as much in the first primary as in the ninth grade. There
would be the gradual advancement from lower class to the higher.
The schools would be filled with wide-awake, active endeavor, in
competition with which teachers of post-meridian usefulness and
questionable success would recognize their own weaknesses and
gradually disappear from the schools. ‘This is the natural plan of
life and practically is in operation in every large business organization in the country, excepting the schools. The Superintendent
has elsewhere had five years of experience with it in large system
of schools, without friction and with excellent success. Under poor
control, it would be miserable plan; but, protected by proper

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
safeguards, four-fifths of the teachers of school would recognize
its superior advantages.

would illustrate the fact-that teachers of co-equal salaries carry burdens of very different weights. One teacher has room of excessively light membership, another carries twice as many pupils. One
teacher, because of light burden, can drop her work with the closing of school; another is forced by the circumstances of numbers
to carry her preparation far into the night. This certainly is unjust.
Rule expresses the conviction of the Board that grade teacher
should not be assigned more than  pupils, and an unassisted ninth 
grade teacher,  but, practically, conditions make such rule
almost impossible. Supposing our present scale of salaries were
continued, how would it do to make the salary of given teacher,
say dependent on an approximation of pupils (excepting in Grade IX), with discount of twenty per cent should the
number fall below  and premium of twenty per cent, if it runs
above  This would tend to make teachers of excessively
large schools more contented under unavoidable circumstances and
would eliminate the injustice now prevailing. This plan might be
open to the objection that it would lessen the pay of some superior
teachers but, on the other hand, there would be compensation in
the fact that such teachers would naturally be assigned the places
where would be the greatest expectancy of premiums.

 BeETTER RECOGNITION OF PRIMARY TEACHERS.—Of limited
efficacy in lessening the impoverishment of the primary schools by
promotions all toward the higher grades, it might be well to at least
amend our present salary scale by making the salary paid for primary teachers better than intermediate salaries. This kind of rule
is in practice in many schools. As far as it goes, sucha rule is good.
In Holyoke we have some very superior primary teachers; but, with
the trend of promotions all toward the grammar grades, the beginning places are usually filled with inexperienced teachers. school
of older pupils would protest and revolt against inefficiency but
the child in the primary school knows no better, and the limited
results ot year in his school life are little recognized.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMIITEE.  
OUR KINDERGARTENS.

Beginning with the opening of school in the fall, kindergartens
were inaugurated in the Appleton Street School, the West Street
School and the Hamilton Street School. The results so far have
been very satisfactory. The kindergartens have been well attended,
the patrons have been pleased, and many requests have been made
for the establishment of such schools in other parts of the city. It
is very much to be hoped that such extension will be early made, for
the kindergarten is of great advantage to the pupil in his later school
life. Besides the inestimable values in sociological training, the
child gains quick perception, keen observation, knowledge of things
as they are, and better command of himself as working being.
A child can afford to lose year in the regular school for the sake
of capable kindergarten training; for in the end he gains time by
his better comprehension of truth and quicker mastery of results.
Beyond that, it touches life at an age when the numbers of school
children are greatest and does world of good in opening up the
young life to the world’s beauty, the harmony of law, and the richer
products of further study. Much as prize the values of the high
school (and recognize no man as its more ardent champion) do
not hesitate to say that, given the opportunity for only the one as
a part of the school system, would cast my vote for the kindergarten rather than for the high school. sincerely hope the day
will speedily come when the beneficence of the kindergarten will be
the possibility of every section of our city.

THE PRIMARY SCHOOLS.

Gaining from the suggestions of the kindergarten, our primary
schools are each year adapting themselves more and more to the
requirements of child life. The first grade should be made more
truly the connecting school and lead more gradually into the conventional school. Many of our first gradesare seriously overcrowded,
and in most instances are poorly equipped with working material.
In consequence of this, the work of the first grade, in general, is

not up to what it should be, and the children spend more time than
they should in doing this year of work. This is clearly shown by

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

Table IV, wherein the number of pupils in the first grade is given
as  while the number in the next grade was  This can
be accounted for only by the realization that the first grade children average more than year in doing year of work. The term,
‘‘Grade one and one-half,’ is an unfortunate misnomer for the
children who, at the beginning of the year, enrolled in grade one
and one-half are apt to be there at the end of the year. As already
intimated, the primary school can be improved by lessening the
number of children to teacher, by strengthening the inducements
for strong teachers to remain in these grades, by providing better
books and more working material, by preceding the schools by the
kindergartens, and by abolishing grade one and one-half.

THE INTERMEDIATE SCHOOLS.

These schools, which might be designated as grades IV, and
VI, have made marked progress during the year, many of them
gaining nearly half year of time. ‘This has been accomplished
largely by giving the pupils richer and stronger mental food. However, these schools are in many respects poorly supplied with
modern books and working material. Theoretically, it is all very well
to talk about the ideal teacher teaching without books, but practically the children who depend on the limited amount of work the
average teacher can place on the blackboard are only half fed with
mental pabulum. Every attempt to place in the children’s hands
working books containing an abundance of material has been
attended by corresponding gain to the schools. Ordinarily the
accumulated losses of backward years show considerably in the
intermediate grades; so that it is very important that capable
teachers should be supplemented by an abundance of material for
the pupils’ advancement.

THE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS.

While in all equity there should be no reason for less efficient
work in the lower grades, the greatest strength below the high
school is to be found in the grammar grades. ‘Lhis comes partly
from the smailer number of pupils given the teacher, partly from

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
the operation of better salaries, partly from better books and
materials, and partly from the fact that principals, supervisors and
departmental teachers give more time to assistance in these rooms.
Although good last year, the work has been rapidly taking better
form and character, so that pupils will this year pass from grade to
grade, and particularly to the High School, much better prepared.
My greatest criticism is on the examination which, under the
rules, still closes the ninth grade. The work is done too much for
the examination, and not enough for the work itself. The natural
spirit of healthy endeavor is sacrificed by the desire to drill on
questions which will probably be asked, and by the necessity of
lining up to technical requirements. Doubtless, this leads to over
stimulus and pressure, which is specially dangerous at this stage of
the adolescence period. ‘The Superintendent has evidence of this
through reports made by parents and others. would therefore

| renew my recommendation of last year: ‘That promotions to
our High School be hereafter made on the recommendation of the
principal under advice from the Superintendent, excepting in cases
| where examination may be demanded by the parent. ‘That
other schools, on given evidence of satisfactory course of study and
methods of instruction, be, on their request, placed on the list of
accredited schools, from which pupils will also be received on
recommendation such schools to remain on the accredited list so
Jong as their nominees to the High School shall prove of satisfactory
character. That stated examinations be held, as before, tor
all those not holding such credentials, and who desire to give
evidence of proper qualifications for admission. recommend
that this amendment to the rule be made at once, so that the
tension in the ninth grades may immediately give way to the normal
pursuit of an education.
THE HIGH SCHOOL.

The most radical improvement of the year has been in the
High School. ‘The evidence of the presence of master hand is
apparent. The loose control incident usually to the operations of
departmental work has disappeared at the assignment of each pupil
