MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
Gentlemen of the Board of Aldermen:—
The City of Holyoke holds to-day high position among
| the municipalities of Massachusetts. Its people are orderly and industrious. The business life of the community was never more
prosperous or on better financial basis. |
We have excellent schools, good system of streets and
sewers, one of the finest water systems in the state, splendid
standard of public health and most efficient fire department.
The credit of the city is high. We can borrow money read. ily and at reasonable rates. But best of all we have established
the principle of paying our bills and not spending money faster
than we earn it. This condition is due first to the people of
Holyoke themselves and then to their agents who in the different
municipal positions have worked together for the good of this
city.
Especially must credit be given to that gentleman who during the past six years has held the office of chief magistrate of ,
the city. The City of Holyoke owes much to Hon. Arthur B.
Chapin and whatever may be our political views we must admit
that in him we are losing an able executive while the Common- .
wealth is securing most efficient chief for its financial department.
A favorable view of the financial situation should not however blind us to other and less promising features. Nearly every —
department in the city is asking for an increased appropriation
while at the same time our receipts are decreasing, one single
item, the corporation tax showing loss the past year of 
ever  This means that economy should be one of the

  MAYOR ’S ADDRESS.
virtues we should practice during the coming year. In the management of municipal affairs am firm believer in the policy of
publicity. It is my personal opinion that the meetings of our
boards and commissions may with perfect safety and propriety be
open to the representatives of the press. There are, of course,
some matters which should not be made public, but with few
exceptions, it seems to me that the greater the publicity of city y
business, the safer are the interests of the people.
FINANCIAL STATEMENT.
The statement of the finances of the city is so well given in
the Auditor’s report that will merely give few facts regarding
it,
The total net debt of the city is 
The net debt exclusive of the Gas and Electric
Light Department bondsis  
The assets of the city are  
The excess of assets over liabilities is .. ;
| This is certainly an excellent balance sheet considering the ;
fact that Holyoke as city has had to do great deal in comparatively short time. In ccnnection with the financial statement
there is one very important matter which should like to call to
the attention of your Honorable Board and that is the advisability
| of selling the stock owned by the city in the Holyoke and Westfield Railroad. The city owes for its Holyoke and Westfield
 Railroad bonds the amount of As security for
these bonds it holds stock, the par value of which is .
This stock can be sold at handsome premium. With the prods of the sale provision could be made for the payment of the
bonds and large sum would be left which we could spend for
school houses, streets, parks or other municipal improvements.
The danger of not selling the stock is, that in these days of rail- |
road consolidation, the transactions of single day might make !
the stock of little value and leave the city with heavy debt and |
no sufficient fund to pay it. |

MAYOR’S ADDRESS.  
GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT.

The progress which has been made by the gas and electric
| department in the two years of its existence demonstrates the
| wisdom of the business policy which has been adopted by its
management. If this policy is allowed to continue for few
years longer, this department will be one of the most notable
instances of the success of the municipal ownership of gas and
electric plants which can be found in the United States. The
difficulties which have confronted this department have been and
are very great. The city took somewhat dilapidated system at

a large price. The first necessity was to build up and properly —
equip the plants. This is being done but it has required and will
require heavy outlay of money. During the past year numerous
improvements and repairs have been made at the gas works,
while the electric light station has gained efficiency by the installation of two Kilowat generators. When the additional
apparatus authorized last year is obtained this station will be in
fair condition to handle the business which is likely to come to
come to it. The great need of this department is new gas
holder. The present storage capacity at the gas plant  less than
  cubic feet. The average output of gas per day is over
  cubic feet with maximum output of over cubic
feet. This is not safe condition. If one of twenty accidents
should happen the storage capacity would be inadequate aid the
supply of gas would be shut off, while if an explosion should
occur the damage and loss to the city would be appalling, for the
supply of gas would be lacking for an indefinite period. believe that the first and most urgent duty of your Honorable
Board is to authorize the erection of gas holder. Notwithstanding the disadvantages under which the gas and electric
department has labored it has reduced the price of gas toa
reasonable rate and it has given the people of Holyoke the lowest
rate for electricity of any city in the state with perhaps one exception. This is certainly remarkable showing. It would
seem that the policy of the city tgward the gas and electric
department should be: First, to give it splendid equipment;

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
second, to enable it to give the citizens the lowest rates for gas
; and electricity consistent with the maintenance of the system;
third, when this point is reached, but not until then, to apply the ,
profits to the construction of public improvements. a
 SCHOOLS.
The school department is the most expensive and at the )
same time the most important department of the city. The work
of the past year in our schools appears to have been most successful. The attendance has been larger and the demands on the :
department increase with the growth of the city. think that
the department has made during the past year an earnest effort .
to practice economy and hope this tendency will continue.
The schools of Holyoke even with the present management cost
more per capita than they should. There is opportunity for the
most careful investigation along this line and the school board
would serve the city well if it should undertake some inquiry for
the purpose of decreasing yet more the cost of our system.
One of the best moves of the year has been the opening of an
evening High School and the popularity of the school is proof
that it filled along felt want. The superintendent, Mr. Nash, and
the corps of teachers have performed their duties in their usual
conscientious and efficient manner. POLICE DEPARTMENT. |
The report of the Police Department shows that we live in
an orderly and law abiding community. The number of grosser
crimes which are committed is comparatively small, the great
majority of offences being misdemeanors and violations of city
ordinances. Not only is the good order of our people shown in
the matter of offences and arrests therefor but it is proved by
the general decorum of the city. There is no part of Holyoke
which can be called unsafe by day or night. |
Probably no manufacturing city in the country can show a
better record in this respect. In every city the police department is the object of some criticism and Holyoke is no exception ,

: MAYOR’S ADDRESS. to the rule. Notwithstanding this, believe we have good
police force. The officers, in the main, are men of good habits
. and fine physique, and they perform their difficult duty with excellent judgment.
| FIRE DEPARTMENT.

The City of Holyoke can boast splendid Fire Départment.
It needs no praise of mine. The results of its work speak
for it. During the year the total fire loss was 
of which  was covered by insurance, leaving net

— loss of only The value of such department in its
influence on property values, insurance rates and the safety of |
human life can hardly be over estimated. The Commission, the

, Chief and his assistants and the members of the department deserve the thanks of the city. am heartily in sympathy with the
action of the Commissioners in arranging to give the firemen
one more day off month. believe it is move in the right
direction and is much wiser than to attempt too radical change
: at once. There is one feature of the department which must be
looked after and that is the matter of expense. In comparison
with the size of the city it is somewhat heavy financial burden
and the members of the commission would do well to carefully

avoid anv unnecessary outlay.

WATER DEPARTMENT.

One of the departinents to which we can always point with
great pride is the Water Department. We have one of the very
best water systems in the country and it is the most valuable
asset of the city. It may not be generally known but our water
rates are the lowest of any city of any size in America.

The principal work of the year in this department has been
the completion of the high service reservoir and the installation
of meters to measure the volume of water coming into the city.

- There is one feature of our water supply to which public attention should be called and that is our extravagant use of water.

 MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
The consumption of water in Holyoke is gallons per
capita per day, as compared with consumption of gallons per
capita in Fall River, gallons per capita in Lowell and  
gallons per capita in Lawrence.
According to the figures, with the exception possibly of
‘Springtield, our consumption of water is greater than that of any ‘
city in the state. If this use is excessive and such it appears to ‘
. be, it should in some way be checked. |
The condition of the department financially and otherwise is '
most excellent and the commissioners are entitled to much credit |
for their honesty, ability and faithfulness, especially as their |
labor is performed without pay or reward. ,
BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS. |
During tbe last year large amount of work has been done
by this Department. Wood block pavement has been laid on a
portion of the west side of Main street. portion of Appleton
street and Sargeant street has been paved with granite blocks
and number of streets have been re-surfaced with macadam.
The marked improvements are the relocation and macadamizing of
the Springtield road south of Berkshire street, the construction
of the Highland and Ingleside sewer systems and the beginning |
of the widening and draining of Northampton street. Public !
spirit, believe, demand that this work should go on. The widening of Northampton street should continue and other streets
and ways should receive attention. Personally hope that some
work may be done on our suburban roads. In these days of the
- automobile it is almost necessity for travellers that there roads
should be widened and there is the further advantage that almost |
all the work on suburban roads is matter of labor and the |
money expended goes into the pockets of the citizens. The .
streets and ways in the more thickly populated portion of the
city also need to be furthur improved and should personally
favor suitable loan for such purposes.
|

MAYOR’S ADDRESS.  
PARKS.

The Parks of Holyoke, although small in area, are credit
to the city. They are well kept and artistically laid out. The
Park Commissioners deserve much praise for doing so much with
so small an expenditure. Indeed the city is fortunate in the
caliber of the men who compose the commission. The principal work
of the year has been the completion of the entrances to Canonchet
Park. The matter of public playgrounds is one that properly comes
under the jurisdiction of the Park Board and it would seem that the
Board should be consulted if any consideration of this important
matter should arise. It isto be hoped that some provision may
be made, by reasonable loan if necessary, for the increasing needs
of this department and that some measures may be taken to enlarge and improve our park system while there remains the opportunity to do so.

HEALTH DEPARTMENT.

The report of the Board of Health indicates that the work
of that very important department has been conducted in the
usual efficient manner. It may not be generally known but our
Health Department with its various officials is regarded as one of
the model departments in the state and the health record of the

 ity shows ample foundation for such opinion.
OVERSEERS OF THE POOR.

The Overseers of the Poor have during the year attended to
the duties of their department in conscientious and able manner.
The duties of the department are performed with courtesy and
consideration and the accounts and records are kept witb accuracy and close attention to detail. do not know of any department where experience counts for more or is of greater value to
the city. The net expense of this department to the city for the
year has been .

: MAYOR’S ADDRESS
CITY ENGINEER’S DEPARTMENT.
. The City Engineer’s department has this last year performed

an unusual amount of work. In addition to all the routine labor

— it has supervised the construction of our roads, the Highland and
Ingleside sewer systems and the completion of the High Pressure
Reservoir. Mr. James L. Tighe, and his assistants execute their
work ina most able manner and in addition to this the department usually lives within its appropriation.

ASSESSORS. .

The Assessors perform their difficult task in generally
satisfactory manner. The business of the office is well systemized
and much information can be obtained in the matter of real estate

. titles if the citizens choose to avail themselves of it. The Assessors are to be commended for the good judgment shown by them
in the settlement of the Lyman Mills litigation.
LEGAL DEPARTMENT.
The average amount of work has been performed during the
| year in this Department. The chief accomplishment has been
the settlement of the Lyman Mills cases. In this connection I
desire to publicly thank W. H. Brooks, Esq., senior counsel, for
the assistance rendered by him in the adjustment of this serious
litigation. At the present time there is but one important suit to
which the city isa party, that of Mr. T. W. Mann against the city.
OTHER DEPARTMENTS.
| The office of City Auditor is each year becoming of more
value and the city is fortunate in the character of the present incumbent of that office.
, The City Treasurer, City Clerk, Tax Collector and City
Physician need no special commendation, for their excellent work
speaks for itself .

The other departments and officials are performing their

duties in faithful and honest manner and the absence of criti- cism is ample evidence of approval.

MAYOR'S ADDRESS.  
CONCLUSION.

As we enter upon the work of this year we find great number of different demands made by the several departments for
appropriations. The Fire Department desires new engine houses,
the School Board wishes new school houses and the friends of
our highly esteemed Company would greatly appreciate an —
armory. In the matter of an armory it would be of great assist- |
ance if site for the armory could be secured by private subscription.

It is for you gentlemen to carefully consider these various
matters and deal with them as the best interests of the city may
require. have purposely refrained from any extensive proclamation of my own purposes for the reason that prefer to be
judged not by what may say in advance but by the results which
I may, with your help and the help of the departments, be able
to accomplish.

The city of Holyoke is our home. Its interests are our interests, and in the spirit of co-operation hope that we may all
work together for the welfare of the city during the year which
lies before us.

. REPORT OF |
|
FIRE COMMISSIONERS. |
i |
OFFICE OF FirE ComMISSION, |
Hoxryoxker, Mass., Dec. :
To the Honorable Mayor and City Council: !
GENTLEMEN: In accordance with the requirements of the |
 City Ordinance your Board of Fire Commissioners present their |
report for the year ending December |
The Board organized January by the election of |
Charles L. Newcomb as chairman, G. J. Prew as vice-chairman :
and John Hildreth as secretary. Your Commissioners have held
twenty regular meetings and many informal meetings during the !
. past year. |
There have been fires and alarms during the past year, |
|  with total damage to buildings and contents of .
Of this amount the insurance companies have paid ,
leaving net loss to our citizens of only an average loss
| per fire above insurance of  detailed account of the fire .
! and losses will be found under the head of fires and alarms. ,
: This is the third year of the permanent fire department
| and the Commissioners are satisfied that the year’s record fully
| ‘justifies the change from call to permanent department. ‘The
change was largely in the nature of an experiment for city of |
Our size, but the three years’ experience we have had with the
Permanent department would make it very unwise to return to
- the old system. J'here have been many fires during the year
Which had in them dangerous possibilities, but by the splendid
work of the department they were promptly controlled. T'wo
ee

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.  .
fires, which added largely to the fire losses, should not really
figure in the losses as the department received no notification of
these fires until the property was destroyed—namely, the Holyoke
 Ice Company’s house, where damage was done to the extent of
$ and the wood pile of C. F. Schuster where damage was
done to the extent of leaving balance of little over
$  for the remaining fires. The Springfield Blanket
Company also had fire to which the department was not called,
which resulted in loss of The fires in the building owned
by Harriet A. Squires and the Holyoke Savings Bank were hard
fires to manage, but they were controlled with comparatively
little loss. ,
We regret to have to record the loss of three human lives by
fire, namely, Michael Sullivan, who was burned as result of an
explosion of kerosene lamp; Eles Koringker, who was burned
to death as the result of playing with matches, and Marjorie Hill,
who lost her life while endeavoring to save some pet birds.
These fatalities emphasize the necessity of all citizens assisting in
keeping the streets clear so that there may be no delay to the
firemen in getting to fire. few moments’ delay sometimes
means both the loss of life and property. number of firemen
have been injured during the past year, but we are glad to say .
. that none of them are of serious nature, but fireman never
knows when he starts out toa fire what the outcome of his
mission will be.
We have as far as possible, with the money appropriated for
our use, equipped the apparatus with rubber tires, but there is
considerable yet to be done in this direction.
The telephone is proving as the years go by what an ,
important auxiliary to the department it is and we are glad to
, testify to the excellent service of our local telephone company.
Your Commissioners feel that the splendid result achieved
by the Fire Department during the last year must be very
satisfactory to the citizens at large as it is to the Commissioners,
and with the growth of the city there necessarily must be an
increase in the expenditure of money for the Fire Department,
but we believe it is more economical to make liberal appropriaREPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS. ol
tions for the Fire Department than it is to have high insurance
rates and large losses. We have endeavored to spend the money
appropriated for use in the Department as economically as
possible. .

We would again bear testimony to the very eflicient work
of the department under the direction of Chief Lynch, and
we believe that the courage and thorough work of both officers
and men in the carrying out of their dangerous duties calls for

| our highest commendation, which we gladly give to them.

We again thank the Honorable Mayor and Board of A!dermen for their liberal treatment of the department in the matter
of appropriations and would suggest that it will be necessary to
appropriate more money than last year, because during the year
six men who now get the minimumsalary of  per year will |
be raised to  per year, and during the last year we were
not able to purchase any hose so that it will be necessary to purchase during the year more than the usual amount. ,

We make the following recommendations which we trust
will receive your careful attention.

First. \We recommend that new engine house be erected
to replace House No.  We have urged for number of years
that lot of land be purchased, but the various Boards of Aldermen have failed to appropriate the money for this purpose. It
must be evident to all who give this matter consideration that
it is growing more difficult each year that we delay, to secure a
lot for an engine house. little investigation on the part of
the City Government would, we are satistied, convince them of
the necessity of new house. The premises we now occupy are

not suitable for an engine house for many reasons: first, the
location is bad one, on account of the crowded nature of the
thoroughfare upon which it stands; second, it is not Jarge enough
to accommodate the apparatus and men that are now there; and
third, it is impossible to keep any horses for engine No. on the
premises, so that in case of fire, the engine at this point cannot
get there till long after the rest of the apparatus, because it has
to depend upon hired horses. This state of things ought not to 
be allowed to exist, but your Commissioners are helpless in this

|
o  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.
matter, and can only continue to recommend new house. The
present engine house can be sold for very nearly enough to build
a new house, and it would seem to be good business to take this
step.

Second. We again report for the fourth successive year our
recommendation that House No. should be enlarged, in accordance with the plans of our city engineer, and that the extension
should be placed on the west side of the house. The quarters in
this house are altogether too small for the apparatus and the
horses. .

Third. We again recommend that House No.  situated
in Ward  should be sold and new up-to-date engine bouse
erected near the center of the ward. This ward is building up so
fast that unless steps are soon taken to secure lot it will be
practically impossible to get one.

Fourth. We repeat our recommendation that engine No.  

should be overhauled and equipped witha new boiler. This is
absolutely necessary as this piece of apparatus has been in active
service about twenty years, and it is unwise to keep it in service

, much longer unless the changes above suggested are made.

fifth. We again recommend that ten-circuit repeater
should be put in the Fire Alarm Department, as we have outgrown the present repeater, and we have come to depend so very
much on the efficient working of the Fire Alarm Telegraph that
we ought not to continue to use piece of apparatus in this
department that is too small. .

Sirth, In making the appropriations we trust that you will
make them large enough so that we can install the coming year
the Pompeii Ladder Drill. We have been desirous of doing this
for number of years, and sent Assistant Engineer P. J. Reilly,
to NewYork to the school of instruction in that city. He is graduate from the school and is thoroughly qualified to train the rest of
our men in this important auxiliary to the Fire Department work,
and the only reason they have not been trained is that it would

— cost about  to equip the department with the necessary
. apparatus. ‘The Commissioners also recommend that the appropriations be increased sufficient to allow them to put two new

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.  
men at the Emerald Engine House; there are only four men in
this house and when any of: the men are absent at meals, there |
are not sufficient men here to properly protect this densely populated district. It will be necessary to put at least two new men
in the Elmwood Engine House, to man the new Hook and Ladder
Truck, which we expect will arrive any day. Also to enable us
to give the firemen an additional day off, making two days per
month instead of one. To give the men this much needed holiday
will necessitate the putting on of four extra men, and your Commissioners sincerely trust that the extra appropriation needed to
carry out the above recommendations, will be furnished them.

The Commissioners also recommend that the Board of Aldermen give the Fire Commissioners power to take advantage of the
State Law, for the pensioning of firemen, who are incapacitated
from performing the duties of firemen; from old age or from injury, received by them in the performance of their duty as firemen.

Seventh. We earnestly urge the Water Commissioners to
install more hydrants as it ts very much cheaper in the long run
to install hydrants which are permanent in their character, than

. to keep on buying so much hose which deteriorates so soon and
has to be replaced at frequent intervals.

APPARATUS.

The apparatus in the department is in better condition than
for many years, with the exception of steamer No.  which we
have been recommending for long time past should be rebuilt.
We have rebuilt Hose Wagons and  and equipped them with
side seats and rubber tires, making them first class up-to-date
machines. We have put Hook and Ladder No. on runners for
the winter as the heavy roads and deep snow made this necessity, and have purchased new Browder jumping net, and
have contracted for new Combination City Hook and Ladder
Truck, which we expect will arrive any day. This Truck will be
placed in the Elmwood engine house, and will do away with the
necessity of the Highland Truck making its long run from the 
Highlands to Elmwood. The truck is known as the Seagrave
Trussed Hook and Ladder Truck, and has all the latest improvements, and will be great addition to the apparatus in the
Fire Department. The apparatus now in active service consists
of six steam engines, two double tank chemical engines, one combination hose and chemical wagon, five two-horse hose wagons,
one aerial truck, two hook and ladder trucks, one three-horse
dispatch wagon, seven exercise and supply wagons, one chief’s
buggy, one reserve engine, twenty-one three gallon chemical ”
extinguishers, one superintendent of fire alarm wagon, three
sleighs.

HOUSES.
The houses as whole are in very good condition and we
have to thank the Board of Public Works for the improvement
| they have made in the Elmwood and South Holyoke houses; and |
we call attention to the various changes and improvements that. |
we have suggested in our recommendations and trust that they
will receive careful attention. |
HOSE.
We have not purchased any new hose during the past year.
For the last few years we have been buying higher grade of
hose than heretofore and our experience has been that in the
long run it is more profitable to buy good grade of hose rather
than cheap grade. We have the following hose in the department, viz.—

We have forty horses in the department, and in spite of the
very best care given to them, our experience has shown us that |
‘in all probability number of these horses will have to be re- |
placed during the coming year. We were obliged to purchase
during the past year five new horses and until some form of
horseless carriage can be devised for use in the department, this
branch of our service will continue to be expensive. We have

examined number of horseless carriages during the past year,
but have not been able to find anything as yet, in our opinion
to meet the severe requirements of the Fire Department, but with
the improved motors that are now being made it would seem as
though success would soon be reached in this direction.

FIRE ALARM TELEGRAPH. .

| During the past year we have put in three new fire alarm
boxes, viz:—Box No.  at the corner of Essex and Pine streets,
Box No.  at the corner of O’Connor and Brooks ave, Box No.
 at the corner of Hampden and School streets. The necessity
for putting the wires underground in the thickly settled portions
of our city, grows more imperative each year. Public safety
demands that this improvement be undertaken as soon as possible.
The risk of the overhead system is too great to be continued

 longer than is absolutely necessary. We have come to depend
so much on the efficiency of the Fire Alarm system that failure
in this direction might result in loss of both life and property and
public safety demands that everything possible should be done to
perfect this branch of our service. We again commend the
superintendent of this department for the very excellent manner
in which this departmenthas been conducted. There is in this :
department the following property, viz:—Strong current protector board, 
Storage battery,  
Case and switchboard,   miles of wire,   tower bells and strikers,  

  mechanical gongs, in engineers’ house, —.. Gamewell signal boxes,   telegraph poles,   private Gamewell signal boxes, |
  inch gongs and indicators,   indicators without gongs,   dead-man,   locust pins,

| REPORT OF THE ,
SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
To His Honor the Mayor and the Citizens of Holyoke :

| The School Committee respectfully submit their annual
report for the year nineteen hundred four.

The work accomplished by the schools during the past year

. has been most successful, not only from the standpoint of education, but also as regards the general comfort and happiness of the
pupils. This record is gratifying particularly because of the fact
that it has been attained under new and unforseen conditions and
at less expense to the city than in many years. But while much
has been accomplished there is, and always will be, something to
do that makes for the general betterment of the school. The

School Committee has cheerfully accepted the task imposed upon
them by the people, and have administered the affairs of this large
school system to the best of their ability.. The education of seven
thousand children involving an expenditure of approximately
$ the selection of Competent teachers, the direction of
their work through the superintendent, and the management of
the schools on an economical basis, is responsibility which the
Committee fully appreciates.

At the beginning of the present calendar year, the total
enrolment in the city was somewhat less than that of year
previous. This decrease was due almost entirely to the opening
of the Parochial School, in Our Lady of the Rosary Parish, in
ward one. Conditions, however, soon changed, and by the first
week of the present school vear, the total enrolment was the
highest in the history of the schools. In October it was found
necessary to re-open the East Dwight Street School building, to

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
relieve the crowded condition at West street. Four rooms are |
now occupied by the primary grades, and Principal J.J. Lynch,
of the West Street School, is in charge for the present. Thus
provisions have been made for the accommodation of the normal '
increase in that district for some time to come. like increase
was also noted at the North Chestnut Street School and again in
the South Holyoke district. The schools in the latter district
have been unable for some years to furnish accommodations for
the large and increasing school population. At present there are
three outside rooms occupied by the pupile, together with an attic
totally unfit for school purposes in the Hamilton Street building. |
To relieve this situation, the city must provide new building for |
that section, or build an addition to the Sargeant Street School.
The Committee recommend that action to this end be taken at
once.
There is an imperative need of new school building instead
of the present North Chestnut Street School, where the increased
attendance brings to the front the sorry condition of the building,
and accentuates its inability to attain anywhere near the best ;
school results even under normal conditions. The bnilding which
is an old one, has been remodeled several times. The ventilation
is poor, the sanitaries out of date, the play grounds small, and the
general situation anything but good. Statistics show that the
per capita cost of education in that building is greater than in any
school in the city. The school is at present overcrowded, and
one primary grade is obliged to use room in Hobert’s block on
Maple street. It is great mistake to consider it more economical to continue to educate children under these conditions than to
provide them with building and surroundings in which air, light,
space and beauty, the qualities so lacking in the present building,
will be features of advantage in every respect to the pupils.
Steps should be taken in this matter at once, as land can now be
secured in that section with less difticulty and expense than few
years hence. The committee urge as strongly as possible that a
modern school structure be erected in place of the present dilapidated one at North Chestnut Street.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE,  
This year many needed and valuable improvements have been
made in the schools, among which were the placing of exits in the
Park Street building, and the general improvement in the ventilating system at the High School building. Many more improvements have been recommended for next year by the various.
committees, the most important of which are the removal of the
gas engine and the perfection of the ventilating system in the
Highland building; the furnishing of settees for the exercise hall
at Nonotuck Street School; the providing of hall for the various
school purposes at the Elmwood building, and the substitution
of small heater for the two old furnaces at Ewingville
School. The matter of providing water for the West Holyoke
School should be again urged, and the question of inadequate
lighting at the Hamilton Street School should be settled at once,
by bringing the same up to modern requirements. The attendance at the Elm Street building, which has been very high for

: the past few years, is again normal. This, however, should not
lessen any efforts to bring about the removal of the department ,
offices from this building, and thereby leave more room for school

» uses. new supply room is also badly needed as the present
quarters in the Elm Street building are small, and too cramped
for the proper arrangement of the school supplies. The proper

} location for the offices and supply room is in the City Hall, and
whenever good fortune brings this about, the school department
will be greatly benefited.

, The School Board, whose prime function is the promotion
of the educational interests of the children, are ever ready to
encourage and promote any movement whatsoever for their
general welfare. This occasion affords an opportunity of recommending the advisability of reserving play grounds in all quarters
of the city for the children. The continued increase in the
population of the city, necessitating the erection of more buildings and houses, is swiftly robbing the boys and girls of the city
of their play grounds and compelling them to look to the gymnasium as the only place for the enjoyment of their sports and
games so essential to their healthy physical development. The
moral influence of their youthful frolic is also supplanted by the

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

baneful effect of the pool room, club room and other such places
to which they turn foramusements. ‘Give usmore play grounds
and there will be less need of penitentiaries,” says prominent
American, and his sentiments meet with hearty approval of all
right thinking people. We would urge in the interest of the
children under our care and the future of our city that the proper
authorities advance to successful issue such worthy project.

The Evening Schools open this year with largely increased attendance, the increase being especially large in the
Grammar and High School Department. The Elementary Department was also somewhat larger than year ago. The importance of this branch of the Evening School as factor for the
transforming of illiterate minors into better and more useful
members of society cannot be over estimated.

This year an Evening High School has been opened and so
popular did it prove that it was necessary to transfer the classes
in Chemistry, Latin, Algebra and the Commercial Department to
the High School building for more room. This change instead

| of decreasing the attendance, as was feared, had only an opposite
effect. The Evening High School is now in flourishing condition, and the Committee is willing to encourage by every facility
those who desire to spend their evenings in study and self- |
improvement. This year special care has been exercised in the
selection of teachers of the Evening Schools and while there
were trained teachers candidates for the positions, no other
applications were considered. The Evening Schools of Holyoke
have too long been considered sinecure for place holders to the
detriment of the self-sacrificing pupil and the injustice to the city
which pays for and expects to receive the best. It is hoped that
the precedent established by this year’s committee will be
followed in the future.

The department of Manual Training is progressing favorably. |
The courses are more popular than ever as result of the in- |
creased attention that it is receiving each year. An assistant
has been appointed to Mr. McDonald, the head of this department, thus assuring full and due attention to the large classes.
This city has not yet however complied with the law which

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
requires such training in elementary schools of cities having over |
twenty thousand inhabitants. The Committee should take steps
next year to have this department extended to the upper grades
of the grammar schools.

In response to strong and general demand, and witha
sense of improving the standard of the schools, the Committee
this year restored the teaching and proper supervision of the arts |
of Writing, Drawing and Music, in the schools of this city. This
work had been successful feature of the schools for many
years, until about two years ago, when this supervision was
abruptly eliminated from the schools. The practical and esthetic
value of this work under proper direction is unquestioned and
your Committee look for high standard of excellence in those
branches in the near future.

; The committee on attendance census and truancy recommend
the appointment of an additional truant officer to that important
branch of service. It is believed that the work of looking after
truants in this city has gotten beyond the power of the present.
efficient corps, and that the service will be greatly improved by
assigning to each officer third of the work instead of half as
at present. The present force has not been increased in twenty
years, although the school population has just about doubled itself. It is hoped that under this increased vigilance that
chronic truancy will be reduced to minimum and the spirit of
that law compelling attendance at school will be properly lived
up to.

The Committee on printing and supplies have met regularly
during the year and have exercised much care in the expenditure
of the school appropriation. The facilities of the schools have
been improved and increased, still  has cost less to operate this
department this year than it has for many years past. The
amount expended in was  while in only
$  was spent. This committee believe that with proper
economy this amount need not be exded for many years.

. The kindergartens of the city have successfully carried on
their work during the past year. The increased attendance
throughout attest the fact that the value of this work is now

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

. becoming more appreciated by parents, who were at first
reluctant about sending their children to them. The different
districts of the city are well supplied with kindergartens excepting the district in the neighborhood of the South Chestnut Street
School. In order to provide kindergarten for the children
there it will be necessary to engage room outside the school
building for that purpose. The committee recommend that steps
be taken to provide kindergarten as soon as possible. |

In the various school departments the spirit of mutual good
will and co-operation have marked the efforts of all during the
past year. To this feeling is due the happy results in all branches

of the school work, and the confidence that the public appear to
have in the working of this department. Such interest is a
healthful sign of the times and is sure to act as safeguard
against any abuse or retrogression of the'school system from any.
cause whatever. To fulfill its mission, to remain dominant influence in the shaping of the world’s destinies, the schools must
be continually improving. In city like Holyoke it costs great.
deal to run the school system in proper manner. But it is the
best investment that any community can make and is sure to
bring its returns inan improved and elevated standard of citizenship.

The amount expended during the year was ,
which was  in excess of the receipts. Many and
unexpected events arose in that time, including the placing of
supervisors in the schools and the providing for the large increase
in the various districts. In view of this fact it will be seen that
this year’s board has kept the expenses down to the minimum
and lived up faithfully to their motto of economy.

We tirmly believe that neither the people of this city nor of |
any other city or town in the land begrudge the money honestly :
spent in the interest of education, and we therefore hope that
proper consideration be given to our school needs by the incoming city government. |

Committee on Annual Report.

REPORT OF THE |
Superintendent and Secretary.
To the School Committee of Holyoke:

I have the honor to submit the forty-first annual report of
the Superintendent of Schools.

Our school department has grown, and is growing rapidly
the figures of attendance for the current year will show considerable increase. When the schools were opened last September,
there were nearly four hundred more pupils than at the corresponding date of the previous year. In the first ward, it has been
judged best to re-open the East Dwight street building, which
had been temporarily closed; and we have now four classes in that
building. The situation in South Holyoke was somewhat more
difficult, as we had no building ready. We have hired two rooms
near the school buildings, and have placed class in each room.
We have now three hired rooms in that part of the city; also, we
have one class established in the hall of the Hamilton street
building, situation that is not properly lighted nor properly
heated, and in every way is unsuitable for the use of class.
There is only one thing to be said about it; the City ought to
provide enlarged accommodations in South Holyoke as soon as
possible.

The next call for increased accommodations will come from
the district between Prospect Park and Elmwood Park. There
are in this district the North Chestnut street, Elm street, Appleton
street and South Chestnut street buildings. The North Chestnut
street building is so crowded that class has been placed in a
hired room on Maple street.

The Elm street building is partly occupied by the offices of 
the School Department. At South Chestnut street we have two
classes in attic rooms, and an overflow class is taught in the hall.

 REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE. ,
The change from separate residences to apartment houses is going
on very rapidly in that part of the city, and the population is
| growing with corresponding rapidity. new building ought at
once to be erected, for the headquarters of the School Department.
This would set free the rooms now occupied in the Elm street
building. We have not proper place for the School Committee
to meet, with proper accommodation for visitors, reporters or
other interested parties; we have not proper offices for superintendent, clerks and attendance officers; and the accommodation
for the handling of books and supplies is ridiculously inadequate.
A new building could be erected on the lot south of the Elm
street school without great expense; and it could be planned and
, arranged to allow fit and sufficient accommodation for all these
: needs, for many years to come. recommend that immediate

steps be taken, looking to the erection of such building.
EVENING SCHOOLS.

The evening schools of Holyoke form an exdingly interesting and important department of the public school system.
We are busy people; but our people are very ambitious, hardworking and courageous. It is not much more taxing to the
average young person tuspend his evenings at the evening schoo]
than to spend them in some idle amusement; and the time spent
at the evening school vields substantial results in increased power, in ability to win promotion or to earn higher wages. large
number of the young people who are employed in our mills and
mercantile establishments are finding this out. The evening
schools are growing, and we may confidently expect that they will
continue to grow. long step forward was taken this year, in the
formal establishment of the Evening High School. Wehave now
classes in Commercial Branches, English Language and Literature,
French, Latin, Mathematics, Chemistry, Drawing, also class in
preparation for Civil Service examinations; and other classes will
no doubt be formed, as fast as there is call for them. fully| developed system of evening schools will include elementary
schools in various parts of the city, with two or three evening

grammar schools and one high school. The grammar schools .
) should be located at Appleton street, West street, and when sufficient demand appears, third grammar school at Hamilton
street. Thus there would be opportunity for all our people,
“young or old, improve themselves by the definite study of appropriate subjects, under skillful teachers; and they could carry
on their education to an extent limited only by their own strength
and abilities. )
USE OF SCHOOL HOUSES.

The school houses are used for the benefit of the people in
day schools and evening schools; also the principals arrange a
good many excellent lectures or musical entertainments, by
which the school houses are known as centers of good influences
in their respective neighborhoods. At Elmwood we have also
the Education Society, which meets at the school house, and
which has been productive of good feeling and mutual understanding between the school and the people. The general usefulness of the school houses might be extended far beyond the
present limits. In every neighborhood the people should be
encouraged to use the school houses for lectures, entertainments,
for reading rooms, for clubs to sing or study music or other
subjects; and in hundred different ways the school building
might be constantly used to add to the interest and value of life
in the community. |

| TEACHERS.

Every means should be taken to encourage and help the
teachers of the city in their efforts toward personal and professional improvement. Many of our teachers are expending
care and labor and no small amount of money in taking lessons,
in buying books and magazines, in sustaining small clubs for
reading and study. Several have regularly taken summer courses
at college or normal school or have traveled abroad. Some are
regular students in the higher departments of our own evening
schools. There are great many ways in which ambitious
teachers find opportunity to make themselves constantly more

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

useful to the community which they serve, and our teachers are

to be commended for the interest and energy which they display

in this matter. In the city of Chicago there is provision by
which teachers who display marked ability and interest, and who
keep studying for their own improvement, are placed in special 
classes and receive higher salaries. It appears to me that this is

an excellent plan and that it might well be adopted in our own
city.

The Teachers’ Association has held several meetings, both
educational and social in their character; and the esprit du corps

| which this association strives to develop cannot fail to be of value
to our schools. We have also our teachers’ meetings, and chief
object at grade meetings now being planned by your superintendent is, to study out in careful detail the course of studies for
our primary and grammar schools. Our course needs revision.
Every active and successful merchant or manufacturer goes
through all the departments of his business from time to time,
carefully studies the work and results in each department, with  
view to improvement. The business man who lets his business
stand still will very soon have no business at all. In our business
of conducting schools, it is even more emphatically true that the
plan of our work should be carefully scrutinized and revised
from time to time and improvements introduced.

It is good thing for the teachers also, especially the younger teachers; they are required to examine with care the fundamental principles upon which their work is grounded, and to
justify their methods in the light of those principles. They have
to investigate questions of vital significance :—Just what work
ought to be demanded of child, in each particular year of his
growth, and in each particular subject? Why are certain things
deemed best? Just what manner of presentation is best for our
pupils? Study of this character cannot fail to benefit our teachers. Thework that is best for us in Holyoke may not be exactly
the same as may best be done somewhere else and our work, if
it is growing, as it ought to be, will change little from year to
year. We have taken up the subject of Arithmetic first, and we
propose to make course that shall be authoritative. In preparREPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
ing the work, every teacher is to have ashare. The other subjects
will follow in due order.

THE HIGH SCHOOL.

The High School is factor of increasing importance in our
civic life. few men still affect to believe that High Schools are
not for the masses, but are special privilege, accorded to the
children of the well-to-do. It needs only to look over the membership of our High School and note the homes of the pupils, for
that assertion to be proved ridiculous. The High School is the
“ People’s College,” where children from all classes, rich and poor,
all may come together to receive common benefits from the
municipality. Thus all are bound together in the bond of ,
obligation and loyalty to the City from which they have received
these opportunities. The schools of lower grade are sectional,
but in the High School all parts of the city are represented. I
urge upon parents that they should send their children to the
High School, even if they cannot keep them there to go through
the course. Let them have year of that broader companionship, and that broader mode of study which they find in the High
School. They will be the better for it throughout their lives.
The general work and conduct of the school are such as ought to
be source of pride to our citizens. Our young peopleare going
forth, after four or five years of study at the High School, to work
in mills and offices or elsewhere, or to enter higher institutions of
learning.

Most of them are so carrying themselves as to reflect credit
upon the school and the city, while some are earning distinguished
honors. We have this year an additional teacher for manual
training. hope to see the work in this subject materially
enlarged in our city and this in two directions. First, in the
High School itself, the work should be so broadened as to include
much work with metals and to make with due proportion of
mathematics, science and language, full four years’ course.
Second, the manual training should be extended as fast as possible
to the elementary grades. Last year it was recommended in this
report that ninth grade boys be sent to the High School for

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE. |
manual training and hoped that this step would be taken before

now. respectfully urge that immediate steps may be taken in

this matter. :

PHYSICAL EDUCATION.

, Attention is being generally called to those matters in connection with schools, which affect or may affect the physical

well-being of our people. For thirteen or fourteen years, that is

for nearly the whole of the growing period, the lives of our

people are very largely directed by the ideals, the requirements
and the customs of the public schools. It ought to be true, not

only that the public schools do nothing to weaken bodily vigor,

but that their influence shall contribute in the most positive manner to increase and upbuild the physical vitality of every single

pupil. The school-buildings and school-rooms should be as

nearly perfect in sanitary arrangements as human ingenuity can

make them. Heating, ventilation, lighting and all matters of

construction should be most carefully provided for. The best

advice should be secured, and where defects are shown, there

. should be no delay about applying remedy. Our Board of

Public Works has taken an intelligent interest in these matters,

and important improvements have been made during the past |

year; yet many things remain to be done. Some of our buildings are faulty, in sanitation, in ventilation, in lighting. For

example, at Hamilton street the light is insufficient in some

rooms. remedy could be applied without very great expense.

We do not know how seriously, in years to come, some people

may suffer from that present defect, nor how bitter may be their

resentment that so obvious defect is not remedied.

The furniture should be such as will contribute to healthful

attitudes and healthful growth. good deal has been done, in
this as in previous years, to place improved furniture in our |
school-rooms; but much remains to be done. The practice has
-been introduced in many cities, of having physician visit the

schools to examine sanitary conditions and to ascertain at once if

any dangerous disease exists in the school. This custom is found

to be good one. It promotes good health in many ways. It

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
costs something, but in those cities where it has been tried, the
report is that the benefits are worth the cost.

The exercises of the school ought to be arranged so as not
to call for too prolonged attention, so as to give proper recesses
with out-of-door play, and so as to give that variety of healthful
attitudes and occupations which growing children need. Besides
this, the school ought to provide such well-considered exercises
in gymnastics and athletics as will tend to cultivate all-round
strength, vigor and good health. There is not yet sufficient
attention paid to these matters. Both in the high school and in
the lower grades, our plans and ideas for promoting good physical —
development need to be very much enlarged.

In connection with this matter is one which hardly comes
within the direct power of the School Committee, yet it is vitally
related to the interests of the children and young people who are
under your special charge—I mean the matter of securing play
grounds for the children in our growing city. It is not too late
now; considerable tracts can be had without undue expense in )
places that are little outside the congested areas; few years
later the same land will be rated at high prices. We can have
very little hope that this will be done. The short-sightedness of
municipalities in such matters has become proverbial. It is the
universal experience that when land can be had for municipal
purposes at small cost, no one can be made to believe that it will
ever be needed, and later generations lament the folly of their
predecessors, while they prod to make some slight effort to
repair the wrong at enormous cost. It can hardly be hoped that
Holyoke should be so much wiser than other cities that it will
deal with these matters in time; but it is the manifest duty of the 
school authorities to call attention to this need while there is yet
time, and to urge the adoption of measures that shall meet it.
The vacant spaces in our city are being rapidly built up.
Hemmed in by the river we cannot seek an outlet to the country
in all directions. It is vital and most pressing need that land
should be secured in the different parts of the city for play
grounds for the children.

In general, have to say that the schools of the city are in

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
a condition of peaceful and orderly progress; the teachers are
loyal, there is full harmony and co-operation among the different
parts of the system, the pupils are well disciplined and fairly
studious. After all it is the direct work of the teacher with her
pupils in the school room that sums up the real effectiveness of
the school system, and careful examination will prove to anyone
that in general the work in our school rooms is going on well.

I have again to gladly acknowledge faithful co-operation and
kind consideration from my associates in the schools as well as
from the members of the School Committee.

Respectfully submitted,
LOUIS P. NASH. .

REPORT OF THE
SUPERVISOR OF DRAWING.
Mr. Louis P. Nash, Superintendent of Schools,
Dear Sir :—

The subject of art education in the public schools has made 
great progress in America during the last quarter of century,
and nowhere more so than in the state of Massachusetts. In
  the State Legislature passed law requiring that drawing
be taught in all towns of more than ten thousand inhabitants and
since that time the recognition of its importance has become so
general that the smallest country towns consider it necessary to
provide instruction in this line.

The art teacher of today has much to consider in laying out
a course of study that shall make the most of the small amount of
time that can be assigned to Art Education in the public schools.
“ Art is long” and broad as well and to select from the great |
variety of important and interesting lines of work those that shall
best aid in the development of the child is no small problem.
Not only must the limited amount of time be taken into account,
but also the possibilities as to securing models, materials and

 illustrations for the course decided upon.

It may be well to consiler for few moments what the aims
are, that are to be secured by such course of Art instruction and
what the means are by which an attempt is made to secure these
alms.

Most educators would agree that the study of Art in the
public schools should develop in the pupil, first, ability to observe,
second, ability to express, third, appreciation of Art in pictures, in
construction and in ornament. large proportion of these
educators would claim also that the third must be considered the
most important point,  e., that the chief aim of Art Education in

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
the public schools is development of the pupil’s taste rather than
the development of mere technical skill.

The proportion of pupils in our schools who will ever become
great artists, even under the most favorable conditions, is infinitesimal, but an overwhelmingly large proportion of them may be
so trained that they will better appreciate the beauties of nature,
that they will be able to discriminate between good art and bad,
and that they will be inspired with desire to gain for themselves
more beautifui surroundings, and all these tend toward broader
and more interesting life.

An endeavor is made to give the pupils such training through
the study of Object and Nature drawing, Composition, Design,
Color, and of great pictures. The time of year when these
different subjects shall be taken up is mostly matter of convenience, that is when the material and illustrations required can
be most easily obtained.

September and October, at the beginning of the school year,
are devoted largely to the drawing and painting of flowers, fruit
and foliage, and in connection with autumn’s wealth of color
systematic instruction in color is given.

During the winter months object drawing and design are
the subjects forstudy. Any attempt to represent the appearance
of an object demands the closest observation on the part of the
pupil and only those who have seen the result of untrained effort
can realize how difficult it is to determine ‘the proportions and
actual appearance of an object. The older pupils are required
not only to make drawing of the object but to see that the —
drawing is well placed on the paper and that the space is well
divided, i. e., that good composition is made.

The design work is, usually, also color exercise to which
the principles of color harmony should be applied. There seems
to be constantly increasing appreciation of the importance of
design. It is so extremely practical and the uses to which it can
be put are so many and varied that its value as an educational
feature is constantly becoming more evident. An effort is made
to have the pupils see as many good examples of design as possible in order that high ideal may be created in their minds.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  

The public library is valuable assistant in this direction, while
the pupils in the schools, in many cases, have brought illustrations that have been helpful to the class.

' For instance, when the pupils were designing rugs recently,
a Grade IX school room had half dozen rugs hanging on its |
walls that had been loaned by different families as an inspiration |
to the pupils in making their designs. Such an incident is a
great help in arousing interest in school work.

In the winter months some attention is paid to mechanical
constructive drawing. This demands great accuracy and aids in
correcting any tendency to careless drawing. More work could
be done to advantage in this line if time permitted. Some
attempts are made also at drawing from life, but this subject
presents great difficulties.

The drawing and painting of plant life is again taken up
with the coming of spring and probably no part of the course
ig more enjoyed by the pupils.

If successfully taught Art Education in the Holyoke schools
should fit the pupil to solve many practical problems that will
arise in his future work and prepare him to appreciate much that

| will make life more valuable to himself and others.

While much has been accomplished, much remains to be
done, and this more particularly because the ideals in Art Education are constantly being raised as its possibilities become more
evident.

Inu many ways Holyoke schools are well equipped for advanced work in this line. Picture study can be carried on here
to far better advantage than in most places. We are rarely
hampered by lack of materials, as the Committee has always been
generous in furnishing all needed supplies. The work being
carried on under such favorable conditions, they have right to
expect good results. While results in the past have met with
approval, there are possibilities ahead and we know that with the
continued support and co-operation of principals and teachers a
higher standard of excellence may be reached in the future than
has ever yet been attained.

REPORT OF THE

SUPERVISOR OF WRITING.

To the Superintendent and Members of the School Board.
Gentlemen :—

Writing is one of the most important and practical branches
taught in our schools. The advantages of its possession are ten- |
fold. How often in looking over the advertisements for help in
various papers do we note the familiar phrase Must be good
writer.” ‘To the elegance of my penmanship,” says the novelist
Dumas, “I owe my first position in life,” and to this accomplishment many of our most successful business men owe their introduction into the arena of business life. The sterling value of
writing then being more than self evident, it behooves us to make
this department as perfect as possible and all are working for its
steady advancement. Besides giving special lessons in the
various rooms, the Supervisor of Writing at each visit, gives for
practice to acquire facility, over one hundred different movement
exercises. The pupils are also looked after individually, each
pupil’s book being marked or stamped, making an inspection of
over four hundred books per day. Not only have we laid stress
on the book work, but teachers are requested to save daily miscellaneous work in language, spelling and composition, which is
inspected by me so that every section of this department receives
special supervision. In grades eight and nine business forms and
methods are taught and rapidity and form strengthened. Altogether we can feel that the past year fraught with diligence
and painstaking efforts has been most successful. It has also
been the source of much pleasure to feel the appreciation of the
parents over the success of their children in this branch of which
Pope has said,

“Of all the arts in which the wise excel.
Nature’s true masterpiece is writing well.”
Very truly yours,
ESTHER A. MACDONNELL.

REPORT OF THE
SUPERVISOR OF MUSIC.
Mr. Louis P. Nash, Superintendent of Schools,
Dear Sir :—

The work of the year has progressed as well as could be
expected, as but six months was under my supervision. Although
we were late in commencing special work we have made progress
and hope to see good results the coming year. In pursuing
the Individual Method, find that the time given to music is very
short. am sure that you will agree with me that one hour a
week (especially in the higher grades) is not enough. In most
of our schools they take music three times week, leaving two
school days without lesson. To pursue the Individual system successfully lesson should be given each day. In the surrounding cities find that more time is given than in our city.

Springfield gives one hour and fifteen minutes.

Westtield gives one hour and forty minutes.

Northampton gives one hour and forty minutes.

Worcester gives one hour and thirty minutes.

New Haven, Conn., gives one hour and fifteen minutes.

New York gives one hour in class.

Then they have extra time given for singing in Assembly
Hall.

Boston gives one hour.

To make this branch more effective to the pupils more time
should be given, say fifteen or twenty minutes daily; and am

 sure in few years it would show in our community. For who
in few years will show the culture of our city but the boys and
girls of to-day? The music at the graduation exercises at the
grammar and high schools was very successful.

Let me here express my hearty thanks to the members of
the School Board for favors received, to the principals and
teachers for their hearty co-operation.

Respectfully submitted,
HUGIL CRAIG,
Supervisor of Music.

REPORT OF THE
PRINCIPAL OF THE HIGH SCHOOL.
Mr. Louis P. Nash, Superintendent of Schools:

The report of the Holyoke High School for the year  
is as follows:

ENROLMENT AND ATTENDANCE.

The important items in enrolment and attendance for the

last five years are shown in the following comparative table:
Year  
Total enrolment,  
Average membership,  
Average attendance,  
Per cent of attendance,  
Tardinesses, 

The total enrolment for the fall term to December ,
is  the average membership  gain of over last year.

The steady increase in per cent of attendance and the de- |
crease in tardinesses are satisfactory. The number of tardinesses
is still in excess of what it should be and it requires constant
attention to keep the figures down to the point that they have
reached.

The entering class is notably large, total of having
entered school in September.

BASIS OF MEMBERSHIP.

A high school is just tax on community because the high
school is one of the means by which community is enabled to
bring into its service in certain lines of special skill the ablest of
its members. But it should not be considered that it is an institution maintained for the convenience of those young people who

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE. |
would pass the days of their youth in idleness. It is an entirely
| insufficient excuse for the presence of healthy boy or girl in the
high school that he happens to be passing in one or even two
subjects of the number easily possible. Such pupil is not
making adequate return to the community for the money expended
on him, and gives no promise of unusual future usefulness. He
should be dismissed from the school as soon as his unfitness has
been demonstrated. The high school should be place for earnest
young men and young women, and the indolent should not be
encouraged by being allowed to remain day after their indolence
has been proved. It is gratifying to report that the High School
Committee have taken action toward eliminating drones from the
school in the future. |
On the other hand it is to be regretted that often boys and |
girls of demonstrated ability are unable to enter the high school ,;
because of lack of means. Every prosperous community should
have loan fund from which young people so disadvantaged
might draw to enable them to prepare themselves for the places
.for which they are naturally fitted. Any possible abuse of the
privilege could easily be forestalled by putting the scholastic ,
standard high to such as would apply for its use.
THE COURSES OF STUDY.
SCIENCE—The course in science has been rearranged the past
year by making two courses in physics, the one elementary the other
advanced, these to be elected normally in the second and the third
years, respectively, as outlined in the report of last year. The
elections of elementary physics have been large in number the
past year, in so far approving the division of the subject.
Physiography has been elected so largely this year that it demands
the time of one teacher. Botany has been omitted because of )
inability to arrange the teaching force.
Accounts—The rearrangement of the course in accounts
recommended in the report of last year was approved by the Committee and went into operation last September. About one hun, dred of the entering class elected the work; about two hundred and
fifty in all are doing work in this course. It demands now the en- ,

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
tire time of three teachers and will need another next year. For
typewriting six new machines were added this fall making twenty
now in service. This number is not even now adequate, and
must be added to the next year.

It is possible that other changes can be made that will help
the work of this department. For bona fide business students it
may be that one-half of the time now devoted to algebra could be
better devoted to practice in the operations of arithmetic. The
work in economics might profitably be transferred to the department of history where it is usually located.

Latin anp GreeK—The varying amount and the varying
quality of Latin presented by pupils who enter the high school
makes necessary suggestion regarding that subject. Its status.
as an elective in the grammar schools and the meagre time devoted
to it there brings about that pupils come to the High School in
all stages of preparation. The grouping of pupils in any division
in any given subject in the High School is conditioned by the
elections made by those pupils in the other subjects. So it
happens that in given division in Latin there may be some
pupils who have studied well what Latin they have had, some
who have studied it only perfunctorily and some who have not
studied it at all. The result is that classes begin at disadvantage and continue through the year at disadvantage. |

| It is question if this condition can be improved in the
grammar schools. Latin there has only secondary place in the
curriculum and that in the ninth grade. It is not convenient
probably to devote to it the time of full subject. This being
the case it might be better to omit the subject in the ninth
grades, reserving its beginnings for the High School. It is
probable that work more satisfactory than at present would
follow. To substitute for it an outline of Roman history, in
which the emphasis would be laid on the prominent men of each
period, would serve the general culture of all the pupils and
would equip those studying Latin later with an acquaintance
with the principal characters in Roman history.
A departure from the traditional reading of the second year
in Latin by substituting Nepos’ Lives for Csar’s commentaries

|
  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
was to be tried beginning last September. The experiment has !
been postponed because the necessary books were not provided.

A moderate sum should be expended from year to year to

 provide lantern slides for illustrating the work in this department.

Ene.iish—The High School Herald, which owes its success
to its direction by the head of the department of English, deserves high praise for its excellence. The excellence of the paper |
is proved by the uniformly high testimonials which it receives
from the best of the school papers which come as exchanges.

This standard has been reached not in day but by careful supervision extending over number of years. The columns of the

paper are used for the literary work of the pupils which is published almost without correction. In addition to giving the |
pupils opportunity for presenting their literary work to the
public, the publishing of the paper gives valuable editorial and

financial experience to those to whom these duties come. The

annual profits are used to add to the adornment of the school

walls. The Herald has well repaid the support given it by the citizens.

History—The importance of the subject of history was |
dwelt on in the report preceding this. You are asked again to
give this department your consideration. Another trained teacher of history should be added to the corps, in order that the work
may be carried on as its importance deserves. The work suffers
from lack of adequate number of books of reference, for which
provision should be made in the next appropriation.

That interest in this subject may be stimulated it is recommended that provision be made for three or more lectures on
historic subjects by lecturers of ability, these to be given before
the school in session and to be open to so many of the public as

 can be accommodated. It is believed that this will be valuable 
extension of the work that is being done.
THE CORPS.

The excellent organization of the school effected by Mr.
Keyes is still maintained. The work is arranged by departments
of English, modern languages, classic languages, history, science,

. REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  

mathematics, manual training, drawing and accounts. The department of domestic science has been discontinued, and a. department of elocution and physical training has been added. The

head teachers of six of these departments at organization are still

in the service of the school. Mr. Brooks and Mr. Arnold in

succession were called to be heads of the departments of modern
languages in Brookline and Springfield respectively. Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Green and Mr. Maxim in turn have gone from the
headship of the department of accounts to law, Brooklyn, and
head of the department of accounts in Newton. Miss Sawyer is

head teacher of history in Mechanic Arts High School in Springfield; Miss Platt, Mr. Tarr and Mr. Goodrich, successively teachers

of physiography, have been called to Brookline, the Hill School,

and Waltham in order. Mr. Downey and Miss Adams, respectively chemistry and English, were called to better positions in
Worcester. From the importance of the positions filled by the
teachers who have gone from the school can be inferred their
value here and the general estimation in which the corps is held

| in other cities.

Three new teachers have entered the corps this year to fill
vacancies, one additional teacher and substitute in the Latin
and Greek. The department of history is without head teacher,
which it should have. .

The work of the office would be much facilitated by the
employment of clerical assistant for at least five months of the
year beginning in June.

A FIVE YEARS’ COURSE.

“Tt should not be considered tragedy that girl take five
years to complete the high school course” are in substance the
words of speaker at the meeting of the Massachusetts State
Teachers’ Association. Especially in the case of those
fitting for college is this sentiment worthy of thought, because
the nervous strain for many girls ought to be distributed over a
greater number of years than at present. Better more time for
preparation and by that means conservation of vital forces. The ’

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
value of an education is reduced by the amount it impairs the
health of the one educated.
LITERARY ORGANIZATIONS.

The Holyoke High School is fortunate in its school organizations in that they all aim to promote the well-being of the
school. The literary organizations include the Club, an organization of girls from the two upper classes, both literary and
social in its scope and of high merit; the Dramatic Club, which
has earned good name by its annual presentations of high
grade; and the Phi Alpha Society, boys’ debating club, yet
young but giving promise of much usefulness.

ATHLETICS.

The athletic teams working under the authority of the
general athletic association of the school make possible certain
amount of certain kinds of physical exercise for many of the boys
of the school. This is not part of the official work of the school, |
but is no less valuable and efficient so far as it goes. The work
done is supported by the pupils and its efficiency is in some
measure limited by the amount of funds that can be collected.

The four departments of athletics acquitted themselves with
credit the past year as usual. The objection to football before
set forth still exists—that too much of the playing is en masse.
There is evident some movement of public opinion requiring an
opener game, and we may in time look for gradual eradication of
football’s worst feature. ,

In connection it may be said that there is need as our city
grows of provision for playroom for our young people. This
need in large cities has been pointed out for long time by educators. Proper playgrounds in congested districts would limit
the processions to the jails. Emphasis was laid on the need of
playgrounds by Principal Lynch at the Massachusetts State
Teachers’ Association meeting. This is subject well worth

considering by those who have at heart the proper training of
: the young.

|
REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
THE BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT.

Desks should be placed in three more rooms for next year to
enable more convenient seating of the groups.

New shades should be put up in the front windows.

Gates are needed to keep parties from the use of the steps
evenings with the consequent scattering of refuse and defiling
with spittle.

Some arrangement for lifting ashes from the pit to the paving
would make the work of the boiler room easier.

An additional safe would be of service for storing the school
records.

VISITORS.

Parents and friends of pupils are cordially invited to visit
and inspect the work of the school.

In concluding it is fitting that the faithful and loyal work of
the corps of teachers the past year should be commended, and
with that the hearty co-operation and sympathy of the pupils in
the work of the school.

Respectfully submitted,
M. M.S. MORIARTY. |

REPORT OF THE PRINCIPAL
OF THE
EVENING GRAMMAR SCHOOL.
Mr. Louis P. Nash, Superintendent, Holyoke, Mauss.,
 Dear Sir:—.

I beg to submit the following report of progress of the
Evening High and Grammar School for the present year.

The Evening Grammar School has not only kept up its
excellent record of last year, but during the present term the
attendance has materially increased comparison with last year’s
record showing an advance of over twenty-five per cent.

In this connection considerable credit should be given to
the excellent corps of teachers assigned to the school.

 The public in general should heartily commend the School
Board for establishing the Evening High School this year.
It supplies long felt need and completes the system of evening
schools in the city of Holyoke. There may have been some who
were fearful lest the attendance and work accomplished in such
a school in our city would not justify the expense incurred, but
if so, the record of the school during the past two months must
be ample proof of the error of this belief. Naturally the first
year or two of an Evening High School is period of formation
wherein the foundation is laid for strong and permanent
institution, therefore the success or failure of the undertaking
should not be judged by this year’s result.

The committee opened the school in the Appleton Street.
building October last and classes were immediately formed in
bookkeeping, stenography, French, mechanical drawing, English
literature, and civil service. These classes increased in membership so rapidly, and the attendance of the Evening Grammar

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
School, which occupied this building, was so large, that it was
} found necessary to transfer the entire business department to the
High School building. Additional classes in typewriting, chemistry, Latin and algebra were then opened in the High School
building and the school at present occupies six rooms in this
- building and four in the Appleton Street building. This, in a
measure, is to be regretted, for all classes of the school should be
in the same building. |
The pupils are young men and women of excellent character
and habits, their conduct is admirable and one needs only to visit
the school any evening to realize with what energy and determination they apply themselves to their tasks.
Our total enrolment is and our membership is made up
of young people from the various departments of the industrial ,
life of our city. The per cent of attendance thus far has been  ,
which is certainly very encouraging. The commercial branches
seem to be most popular, the enrolment in these classes being  ,
but the highest per cent of attendance is held by the class in
English Literature at per cent. |
The session this year having been extended to seventy-five
nights, we hope to accomplish better work than in the past, and I
trust the time is not far distant when the Evening High School
shall be so perfected that full and complete courses will be opened
in industrial as well as commercial and classical work.
Our thanks are due to the members of the School Board and
the Superintendent of Schools for their close interest in the work, ,
and we are also very grateful to Mr. Moriarty and Miss Fay of
the day High School for many favors. |

REPORT OF THE |

BOARD OF HEALTH
To the Honorable the Mayor, and Board of Aldermen:

Gentlemen:—In compliance with the public statutes, the
Board of Health herewith submit for your consideration the
twenty-fourth annual report.

The Board met for organization on the first Monday of
February, electing the following officers: Chairman, Dr. Arthur
B. Wetherell; secretary, Dr. Frank A. Woods; health ofticer,
Mr. Jeremiah J. Linehan.

GENERAL WORK.

In submitting this report, the Board is pleased to state that
the general public health and sanitary conditions of Holyoke
compare most favorably with cities of its size throughout the
commonwealth. :

The public health of the city has constantly occupied the
minds cf the members of the Board, individually and collectively,
and all nuisances, sources of filth, causes of infectious or commun- ]
icable diseases and the general routine work has in every case
received immediate and careful attention. In order to protect
the public health and to keep the mortality down to minimum,
it is often necessary to enforce the laws and to adopt such rules
as will best remedy existing conditions. This the Board has endeavored to do irrespective of place or person.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.

There are yet several old and dilapidated buildings, the removal of which would greatly improve the sanitary condition of
the localities in which they exist. Eight such buildings have
been removed during the past year by order of the Board.

BAKERIES.

The Board has continued to exert the utmost care in the
supervision of bakeries. Such inspections of bakeries and their

| surroundings as is prescribed by law have been made.

The general condition of these important places where much
of our food product is manufactured was found very satisfactory
in most cases. Eight warnings for minor offences were sent to
owners of bake shops and the Board will continue to use its best
efforts to keep these shops up to the standard.

Four new bakeries have been installed during the year and
there are at present twenty-eight bakeries in operation in the
city.

BACTERIOLOGY.

The Board has continued the system of bacteriological examinations in all cases of diphtheria or throat trouble of suspicious
nature with very satisfactory results. Of cultures examined
it was found that were negative thus saving expense, danger
and annoyance in quarantining many people.

The Board would request each physician to exercise care and
promptness in taking swabs for diagnosis and release. In all
cases when the clinical symptoms indicate diphtheria and the
swab taken is returned negative, second swab for diagnosis
should be taken on the following day. Two consecutive negative
swabs are the smallest number that should be relied upon as an
evidence that danger of contagion is passed in case.

Appended is the report of the Bacteriologist.

. REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
UNDERTAKERS.

Thirteen licenses have been granted during this year. The
undertakers are prompt in filing the certificates of death, and are
careful in making their returns.

SLAUGHTER HOUSES.

; All manufacturers of sausage and prepared meat within the
city have been granted licenses by this Board. Ten liceases have
been granted for the manufacture of sausage, prepared meat and
slaughtering. There is only one licensed slaughter house within
the city limits.

The supervision of these places of business has caused an improvement in the character of the articles furnished to the public
for consumption. ,

BARBER SHOPS.

The Board can state that all the barber shops are doing work
in strict accordance to the rules and regulations and there have
been no complaints. Two general inspections of barber shops
have been made during the year and the same were found provided with running hot and cold water and in good sanitary condition.  There are at present fifty-two barber shops in the city.

FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.

The Board was forced to resort to legal measures in three
cases for selling decayed fruit, with convictions in each case.
These convictions were for peddlers from outside of the city, who
had no licenses.

We are pleased to state that there is no cause for complaint
with local dealers and the city is practically free from the sale of
decayed fruit and vegetables.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
INSPECTOR OF MILK, VINEGAR AND PETROLEUM.
A rule condemning the use of the wooden plugs for milk
cans was passed by this Board, April the same to take
effect on and after July  of the current year, and the Board is
pleased to report that all milk dealers have complied with said
rule.
We can report that the duties of this office are performed
| in most satisfactory manner, the general quality of milk is up
to the standard and there have been very few complaints.
The placing of the Milk Department under this Board with- :
. out an extra appropriation has compelled the Bvard to economize in every conceivable way. The bills for the Milk Depart| ment for the current year will be necessitating transfer of money to this department to meet expenses for the fiscal
year. We would therefore request an extra appropriation to
cover the expenses of this department next year.
BARNS AND LIVERY STABLES.
A circular explaining the state laws and the requirements of
the Board has been sent to all contractors, so that there may be
no mistake by the building or occupancy of barn without a
license. The general condition of barns in this city is most satisfactory. |
Nine applications have been received for the erection or use |
of buildings as barns. These have received careful consideration.
The locations have been inspected and permits have been
granted in all cases.
|
BOARD OF PLUMBING EXAMINERS.
The Board of Plumbing Examiners have examined all ap- !
plicants referred to them by this Board. |
There have been two applications made to the Board for
Master and five for Journeyman plumber’s licenses.

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  

Six of the above applicants were granted licenses and one
was refused.

Appended is the report of the Plumbing Examiners.

SANITARY INSPECTION.

, The Board can report that the work in this division of its
department has been carried on in thorough and satisfactory
manner.

The report of the Inspector of Plumbing shows that there
has been more new work done in the city during the past year
than in the preceding twelve months, and the addition of the
unusually large amount of old work condemned and replaced,
together with the required tests, have necessitated large num- |
ber of inspections. |

A house-to-house inspection of plumbing is an urgent
necessity and the Board would again recommend that special
appropriation be made and the work commenced early in the
year. The report of the Inspector of Plumbing is appended.

VAULTS AND CESSPOOLS.

Wherever sewer privileges have allowed, the use of the
vault has been condemned. The Board is pleased to state that
there are practically no vaults remaining in the city.

SEWERS AND DIRAINS. |

The Board is pleased to state that an agreement has been
made with the Board of Public Works, whereby the outlet of
the Walnut street sewer will be extended below the dam and the
nuisance abated.

The large amount of sewage discharged directly from the
mills into the canals in their course through the city is objectionable from sanitary point of view, and the public health demands
that some other disposal of this sewage should be made.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.

The Board would again recommend that lateral sewers be
laid on Main street, north and south from Berkshire street, and
that some provision be made for the east side of North Summer
street.

The completion of the Highland and Ingleside sewers will
enable the Board to cause the removal of the privy vaults and
cesspools in these localities and the city will now be practically
free from these vaults. |

VITAL STATISTICS.

The Board present for consideration the following tables,

a resume of the Vital Statistics for year ending Nov. :

| There has been reported during the year deaths and  
still births, death rate of per cent. per thousand inhabitants, which compared with deaths and still births, a
death rate of per cent. per thousand reported during  ,
shows an increase this year of only deaths, or less than one-half
of one per cent. This is satisfactory when the increasing, and at
the same time rapidly changing population, is considered, and
also when the fact is noted that of the deaths recorded during
the year have been non-residents.

Table A, as appended, shows the comparative number of
deaths, still-births and death rates for the past fifteen years. It
is interesting in that it shows that during this period there have
been deaths in the city, an average of deaths per
year, with an average death rate of per cent per thousand.
It shows that while the population of the city has increased
during this time from in to at the present
time, there has not been corresponding increase in the number
of deaths.

: Table presents the number of deaths and still-births !
occuring each month of the year, showing an average of  
deaths per month. By comparison with the table it will be seen
that there has been but little variation from the average during
the various months and also that there is an absence of the usual
high mortality during the summer.

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  

Table shows that of the deaths recorded during the
year or per cent were males and or per cent
were females and of the still-births reported were males
and were females. By referring to the corresponding statistics for  we find that during last year per cent were
males and per cent were females, showing an increase of
  per cent in deaths among females and corresponding
decrease in the deaths among males.

‘ Table gives deaths by sex and age, showing that of the
  death recorded, or per cent were under one year
of age, or per cent were under five years of age
and or per cent were over fifty years of age. Comparing these with when there were or per cent under
‘one year of age, or per cent were under five years of
age and or per cent were over fifty years of age, we
find that there has been decrease of or per cent in the
number of deaths under one year of age, decrease of or
  per cent in the number of deaths under five years of age
and an increase of or per cent in the number of deaths
over fifty years of age.

It is also interesting to note that of those under one year,
  were males and were females, of those under five years
of age were males and were females and of those over
fifty years of age were males and females.

Table shows the number of deaths occurring at the various ages in the several months and it is interesting as showing the
time of the year when the greatest mortality occurs at different

"periods of life.

Table presents list of diseases with the number of deaths
from these causes during the past twelve months. It shows  
deaths from diseases of contagious nature as compared with  
during the preceding year. We find marked increase in the |

- number of deaths from tuberculosis, there having been as
compared with during  There have been deaths from
cancer as compared with during the preceding year. We also
find an increased number of deaths from diseases of the heart and

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
circulation, this increase occurring largely in people over fifty
years of age.

In nervous and digestive digeases, we find little variation
from the number of deaths recorded last year, and note slight
decrease in the deaths due to violent causes.

Table gives the number of deaths occurring in each of
the institutions of the city and also those occurring in each ward.
It is of interest as showing that portion of the city in whieh
there is the greatest mortality. Wards Two and Four still have
the greatest mortality, as in the past few years, the mortality in
the other wards, however, is more evenly divided. One hundred
and ninety-five or per cent of the total deaths of
the city occurred in the institutions. Seventy-seven or  

] per cent of the deaths occurred among non-residents of the
| city.

In Table will be found the nativity of those dying in the
city. Of the deaths, were born in Holvoke, in .
Massachusetts otherwise, and total of in the United
States, were born in Ireland, in Canada, in Germany,
  each in England and Scotland, and the remainder in other

. foreign countries.

Table presents the place of interment of all bodies
buried in the city, also the number of those sent away or
brought here for burial. It shows that  bodies were brought
to Holyoke and sent away for burial. Nine hundred and
eighty-eight burial permits were issued during the year.

CONTAGIOUS DISEASES.

The city has been fortunate during the past twelve months,
in that it has not been visited by any epidemic of contagious
nature. During the last two or three months of the year the
number of cases of diphtheria was somewhat increased, but at
no time have we been threatened by an epidemic.

The following tables show the comparative number of cases
and also the number,of deaths from the various contagious dis) eases during the past five years, and are interesting as showing
the steady decrease both in the number of cases and the deaths
from the same, during that period.

In review of the table of contagious diseases by wards we
find that in Wards Three, Four and Five have occurred the
largest number of these diseases.

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
) DIPHTHERIA.

- There has been reported during the year cases of
diphtheria with deaths, death rate of per cent as compared with cases with deaths, death rate of reported
during  The disease has been prevalent throughout the
year and also throughout the city, Wards Four and Five having
the largest number of cases.

MEASLES.

Thirty-two cases of measles have been reported during the
year, occurring mostly during the summer months, with no
deaths. The disease was present throughout the city but was
more prevalent in Ward Four.

SCARLET FEVER.

Scarlet fever has been evident throughout the year, especially from December to July. Twenty-five cases have been reported with three deaths, death rate of per cent. Ward
Three has had large portion of the cases of this disease.

TYPHOID FEVER.

There has been reported during the year twenty-eight cases
of typhoid fever, with six deaths, death rate of per cent.
Over half of them have been traced to points of contagion outside of the city. The disease has not been limited to the resi‘dents of any ward, although Ward Two presents the greatest
number.

| SMALL POX.

The city has been free from this disease during the year.
A number of reported suspicious cases have been investigated by
the Board but in no instance has the disease been found.

There has been reported to the Board in all cases of
disease of contagious nature during the year, with deaths,
a death rate of per cent.

The appended tables give the detail of these cases.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
CONTAGIOUS DISEASE HOSPITAL.
The Board would once again call attention to the imperative
-need of hospital for the care of diseases of contagious nature,
especially diphtheria and scarlet fever. The value of such insti- |
tutions is being realized more and more each year and many
cities of the state now have such accommodations which greatly
aid in the control of epidemics of such diseases. With our large
tenement districts, it is evident that we should have such building at our command in the city.
PEST HOUSE. |
The present pest house in use by the city is well suited in
most ways and furnishes very satisfactory as well as secluded
place of confinement for persons suffering with small-pox. Improvements recommended last year should be made. sanitary
system should be arranged to remove the sewage from the building and satisfactory receptacle made for the same. small addition should also be added to include disinfecting room for
those who are obliged to visit the building, and also bath-room
for the use of patients. These necessities are indispensable and
should receive immediate attention,

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  

Each case has complied with the requirements of the
Board. During the year an unusual amount of examinations of
imperfect plumbing and nuisances pertaining to same have been
made and large share of the Inspector’s time is taken up with
these complaints. am pleased to state that the completion of the
Highland and Ingleside sewers will enable the Board to cause the
removal of the cesspools and privy vaults in these localities and
the city will now be practically free from nuisances of this kind.

Two general inspections of barber shops have been made
during the fiscal year and all the shops were found provided
with running hot and cold water and in good sanitary condition.
Eight warnings for minor offenses were sent to owners of shops.

Twelve applications for barns have been granted by the
Board, nine of which have conformed to the requirements of the
law and three have become void.

I would again call attention to the sanitary condition of :
Hillside Hospital. fumigating and bath room should be
installed for the use of convalescent patients and proper disposal made of the sewage. The continued use of the privy
vault in its present location is to be condemned, and in the

 opinion of the writer there is grave danger of the pollution of
the water of the surrounding country by the present general
sanitary conditions, which are positively dangerous when the

 house is occupied by small pox patients.

A house to house inspection is an urgent necessity and the
work should be commenced immediately.
In conclusion desire to thank the members of the Board
for their courtesy and co-operation.
Respectfully submitted,
F, L. AVERY,
Inspector of Plumbing.

REPORT OF THE
BACTERIOLOGIST.
To the Board of Health, Holyoke, Mass. :

GENTLEMEN :—I herewith hand you my report for the year
ending November :

During the past year there have been referred to me, as
bacteriologist of the Holyoke Board of Health, cultures from
  cases of sore throats, to determine the presence or absence
of diphtheria bacilli. Of these, were sent for purposes of
diagnosis, while were received for release only. consider
this very good showing, indicating, as it does, very marked
effort on the part of the physicians to submit culture for
diagnosis in all cases. The number of cases sent for release
only,  was the same this year as last, and of this number but
one was found to be positive, which also was the case last year.

A notable increase in the number of cultures sent to the
laboratory for the purpose of reiease of positive cases has been
shown throughout the year; in fact, the majority of cases that
proved to be true diphtheria have not been released without a
negative culture.

There is one point connected with the bacteriological
diagnosis of diphtheria that should always be borne in mind, and
this is that one negative culture for diagnosis is not, in many
cases, sufficient to exclude diphtheria. In doubtful cases, two,

. three and even more cultures should be taken to positively determine the presence or absence of diphtheria germs. By doubtful
cases mean those in which the clinical diagnosis differs from
the laboratory findings, and those cases presenting membrane
upon the pharynx. In this connection the record for this year
shows that there were six cases submitted for diagnosis in which
the first culture was negative, but diphtheria bacilli were found

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH. ,
in the second culture, thus showing the need of secondary cultures in doubtful cases. ]
Compared with the figures for last year, have examined  
more cases, and more cultures this year. The following table

City Auditor.

The Board is pleased to report the completion of the High
Service Reservoir.

The preliminary work on this reservoir was commenced in
 when the timber and brush growing upon the bottom and
sides of the basin were removed and the work of building the
dike commenced. The work has been prosecuted every year

since with the exception of  .

The flooded area of the new reservoir will be acres,
capacity gallons, or gallons with flashboards. The height of the overflow will be at elevation  or
  feet above that of Ashley Pond and feet higher than the

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
overflow of the Whiting street intake reservoir. It is estimated
that the increase in pressure will be about pounds over that
of Ashley Pond.

The main dam of the new reservoir is feet in length,
and is feet wide at the top and feet at the base, and is
  feet in height. It is an earthen dam, paved on the inside
with cobblestones, and has rubble concrete core feet thick at
the base and foot inches thick at the top. The core-wall is
built to within three feet of the top of the earthen dam.

At the southwest side of the reservoir dike has been
built, the length of which is feet, the height being feet.
The dike is also of the earthen type with rubble concrete core,
and is feet wide at the base and feet wide at the top. In
addition to this, perishable material taken from the reservoir has
been deposited on the outside of the dike, making it feet or |
more wider. ,

The amount spent on the High Service Reservoir this year

was .

Following out its plan of cleaning up and protecting the
watersheds of its several reservoirs, the Board has arranged for
the purchase of the Connery farm in Westhampton, thereby
removing menace to the sanitary conditions of Manhan brook,
one of the feeders of the Fomer Reservoir. The Board also
purchased of the James Moss estate parcel of land at High
Service Reservoir.

During the late fall four large meters were installed on the
main pipe lines for the purpose of ascertaining correctly the
quantity of water being used, as the Board never has known just
what the consumption was, it having been estimated previously.
Three of the meters,  -inch and  -inch Venturi and  inch Premier, were installed on the main pipes from Ashley
Pond, and the other,  -inch Premier, on the main pipe from
Whiting Street Reservoir.

The results obtained showed an extraordinary consumption,
the total daily average running up to gallons, or  
gallons per capita. On learning this the Board took immediate
steps to cut down the excessive waste, which was indicated by so

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.

large consumption, and has placed meters in several of the
tenement blocks in different parts of the city, also in few of
the saloons, in order to determine what the consumption is at
these places, and to have some data to work from. There has
not been sufficient time since the installation of the small meters,
however, to obtain very definite data, but it is the determination
of the Board to bring the consumption down to reasonable per
capita allowance.

The Board intends opening up channel through the rock
cut from Wright’s Pond, this coming year, and locating the
intake, by the construction of gatehouse there, at the easterly
end of the cut. The  -inch pipe now laid through the rock cut
will be used for the high service system, connections having
already been made with the pipe from High Service Reservoir,
and will feed one or both of the  -inch mains, which will
furnish water to the Elmwood and Highland sections.

: It has also been decided to lay large main from the high
service system through Homestead avenue and Westfield lower
road to the City Farm, thereby increasing the pressure in that
section, and giving to the south end of the city what it has long
needed—hbetter fire protection.

The City Engineer has been instructed to commence the
preliminary work in connection with the new storage reservoir
at Fomer, recommended by him when this supply was projected.

The serious illness of our faithful and efficient superintendent,
Deacon John D. Hardy, which confined him to the hospital for a
couple of months during the summer, caused the Board considerable anxiety, but, thanks to the skill of the operating surgeon,
the good care he received and his rugged constitution, he was
able to take up his duties before the season’s work ended.

Through the efforts of the Board, and the co-operation of
the Mayor and the Business Men’s Association, the New England Water Works’ Association held its annual convention here
September  th to  th, bringing to our city some visitors
from different parts of New England. ,

It was source of great satisfaction to the Board to have

such representative body of water works officials visit our city,

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
and judging from the expressions of the visitors they were well
pleased with the entertainment provided for them, and with the

 beauty of the city and its surroundings and the industry and
enterprise displayed here.

The papers read at the convention were of high order,
and included three by local men—Albert F. Sickman, hydraulic
engineer of the Holyoke Water Power Company; James L.
Tighe, City Engineer, and Water Commissioner A. M. French.

The Holyoke Water Supply.
BY A. M. FRENCH, MEMBER BOARD OF WATER COMMISSIONERS,
HOLYOKE, MASS.
[Read September ]. |

High on the list of institutions of which Holyoke is justly
proud is her magnificent system of water works, which furnishes
to every part of the city supply of pure water sufficient for all
contingencies. The story of its conception, birth and continuous
growth up to its present maturity is full of interest.

Sixty years ago Holyoke was “a small hamlet or neighborhood of farms nestling in the bends of the Connecticut,” and
known as “The Fields” or Ireland Parish. It contained fourteen houses, schoolhouse, small grist mill and cotton mill.

In several Boston men, having knowledge of what
had been done on the Merrimac river, at Manchester, Lowell and
Lawrence, associated themselves together to develop new city
and new water power on the Connecticut, and in were
incorporated under the name of the Hadley Falls Company. As
they were mostly cotton men, their idea was to found cotton
city; and there is still in existence map of the new city as they
planned it, with canals, streets and public squares all marked out,
and spaces allotted for over fifty large cotton mills. .

|  Having purchased eleven hundred acres of land, they commenced the construction of the first dam, which was completed
November and disappeared “by way of Willimansett”
the same day. At about the same time they provided fora |
water supply for the town by the construction of reservoir
on the plot of land bounded by High, Maple, Lyman and Foun- ,
tain streets, and including the whole square where Dillon’s Block
now stands. Tbe pond was entirely artificial tank was

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.
 
erected, not excavated, with walls feet high and feet
thick, and was divided into two sections, so that one would be
available while the other was being repaired or cleaned. It held
  gallons of water, which was pumped into it from above
the dam, through  -inch pipe, by means of pumps located in
the gate house. The water stood at an elevation of feet,
or feet above the crest of the dam. Thirteen thousand feet
of pipe were laid, and as fast as new streets were opened they
-- were piped.
Water was first pumped into the reservoir October  ,
 and the next month saw the work completed. In  
the Hadley Company failed, and the water works passed into the
hands of the Holyoke Water Power Company.
Although the working of the reservoir was never entirely
satisfactory, and complaints became more numerous and emphatic as the town increased in size, no action was taken in the
matter until August when meeting of citizens was held
at the office of Judge Buckland. committee was appointed
consisting of John C. Newton, James G. Smith, Timothy
Merrick, W. B. C. Pearsons, and John E. Chase, with instructions to inquire into the practicability of supplying the town
with water and the cost of so doing, to give the matter a
thorough investigation, and to report at an adjourned meeting. |
This committee secured the services of an engineer, and com- |
menced their work. |
Five plans were suggested |
 To supply the flats from the canal, and the hill from the .
reservoir. |
 To pump water by steam from the river above the city.
 To take water from the Whiting Street Brook.
 To make use of the mountain ponds lying three miles to
the southwest.
o. To make more efficient the existing system.
Five weeks later the committee reported that pure and
ample water supply could be obtained from the ponds at an
estimated cost of and unanimously recommended
this plan.
|

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  

The location of these ponds, and of the other sources of
supply mentioned in the paper, is shown on the map, Fig.  .

Meantime events had occurred which caused general and
intense interest in the subject. In the summer of there
was protracted drought, and just at its height the machinery
for pumping water gave out, so that for three weeks it was with

“ the utmost difficulty that enough water could be procured for
bare existence.

These words, taken from the Z'ranscript of September  ,
  strikingly depict the woes of the community: “The local
water famine is over for the present. The water brigade, with its
pails and buckets, has ceased to wend its dripping way through
the streets, and retired from active service. The perambulating
water barrels have ended their journeys to and from the river,  .
and their drivers do rest from their labors. The washerwomen
have again the wherewithal to ply their trade, and tidy housewives
have done their three weeks’ washing and regained their
wonted cheerfulness. Cleanly people have resumed their habit
of daily ablutions, and few bolder spirits have even ventured to take bath in the precious fluid.”

The feelings of the community, in view of these experiences,
are well voiced by the Zranscript in the same issue:

“The town has learned thoroughly that regular and inexhaustible supply of pure water, with sufficient head for use in every
part of every building in town, has come to be necessity. It is a
large undertaking and one which many of our citizens have been
inclined to postpone until the town should be larger and richer ;
but the events of the last three weeks have converted the advocates of delay to the party of action.

; Public water works owned by the town, managed by the
town for the benefit of the town, is the need of the hour, and if
the expense should be found to be within reasonable limits, we
predict hearty and unanimous movement to secure this public
blessing.” ;

This prediction of the Transcript was speedily fulfilled. The
town meeting called for the purpose accepted the plans outlined

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.
by the Citizens’ Committee, and in the following winter the necessary legislation was obtained. ,

The first water board of Holyoke, consisting of W. B. C.
Pearsons, Dennis Higgins, John Delaney, J. P. Buckland, Joel
Russell and John E. Chase, was chosen March  It held its
first meeting in Judge Buckland’s office in Carter’s Block, and organized with Mr. Pearsons as chairman, Judge Buckland, secretary,
and Mr. Russell, treasurer. It then proded with great energy
to the business for which it had been created.

, Ashley and Wright’s ponds lie little more than three anda
quarter miles from the City Hall. They have water shed of
  square miles, and flowage area acres at the natural
level. It was decided, however, to construct the dam, gatehouse,
and embankments so as to admit of raising the water level five
feet, this to be done gradually at the rate of about one foot per
year, thereby materially increasing the flowage area and about
doubling the storage capacity. .

At first only the ponds and the land absolutely necessary
were purchased, but it has been the policy of the board, steadily
adhered to through all these years, to acquire the surrounding
lands littie by little, until now, in  practically all the watershed of the system is in possession of the city.

After determining the route, careful attention was given by

the board to the kind and size of pipe to be used. Being new |
questions to most of the members, the matter was exhaustively
studied and the final decision was to use only cast-iron pipe, on
the ground that it would be poor policy to lay anything except
the best, and to use two sizes,  -inch for the first feet and
 -inch for the remainder.

Having settled these questions, the board was ready early in
May to give out contracts, which were awarded as follows: For
supplying pipe, to J. W. Starr Co., of Camden, N. J.; for laying same, to E. B. Allen Co., of New Britain, Conn.; for
excavating, to John McCoy Sons, of Holyoke; for building a
dam at the outlet of the ponds, gate house, and culverts over the
trench between the ponds, to Goldsmith Norton, of New
Britain, Conn.

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
These contracts called for the commencement of the work
by June and its completion on or before October of
that year. All piping was to be delivered by September  As
a matter of fact, however, the last cargo of pipe did not come to
hand until December  three and half months late. Owing.
to this delay, and to unforseen obstacles encountered in excavating, it was not until August two months after the contract time, that water was let into the mains.
inthe  ranscript of July  appeared the following: Work
at the ponds is progressing finely, and the great work is nearly
done. The water should be in the pipes next week, barring acci- |
dents, and the week after, whether orno. There will be general
rejoicing when it does come, and we believe it will be the greatest blessing that could be given us. Won’t there be lot of
happy fellows and others floundering in bath tubs! Even the
yard toads will rejoice as they sit under the spray of the fountain.”

) Meantime most curious controversy had arisen between the
board and the town treasurer, Mr. C. W. Ranlet. In accordance
with the provisions of the legislative act, the board caused bonds
to be issued to the amount of payable in  and bearing interest at the rate of per cent. payable semi-annually. These
bonds when printed were sent to Mr. Ranlet, who retained them
in his possession, claiming that their control and custody belonged
to him, and also the handling of the money accruing therefrom.

 The board was of the contrary opinion, and at length, after many
attempts to reach satisfactory settlement, appealed to the Supreme Court for writ of mandamus, compelling the surrender
of the bonds. hearing was held before single judge, who
ordered the issue of the writ. The treasurer then appealed to the

fall bench, and it was not until October that the matter
was settled and the bonds placed in the hands of the board.

October it was voted to buy the pipe and fixtures
of the Holyoke Water Power Company at price not exding
$ Judge Buckland was so strongly opposed to the measure that he insisted on having his dissenting vote placed in the
records. .

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.
. Holyoke became city in January,  and the term of
office of the old board expired by limitation at that time. The first
board chosen by the city of Holyoke consisted of Judge Buckland,
elected for three years; Dennis Higgins, for two; and J. G. Smith,
for one year. It organized with Judge Buckland as chairman,
and held its meetings in Lincoln’s Block, having secured an office
there at rental of  per month. When the City Hall was
finished in  the Board of Water Commissioners had the
honor of being the first department of the city government to
take up its quarters there.
The legislative act of permitted the use of the Tannery
Brook, but no action was taken in this direction for several years.
In February,  the water of the ponds reached its lowest
‘point, being feet inches deep at the gate house, and water
famine seemed imminent. In view of this fact, the Board in its
report of December,  called for early action on the part of
the city council to make the waters of Tannery Brook available,
This recommendation was repeated with increased earnestness in
the reports of the next two years. But the city council was
unmoved. The year  however, was very dry and it became
necessary to pump water from the large pond to the smaller.
Then at length the city council made the necessary appropriation, and in dam and gate house were built and  -inch |
main laid to its connection with the  -inch main from the ponds.
This, it was calculated, would deliver gallons each twentyfour hours. In order to keep the water of the brook from pollution, the board purchased of A. Goodyear “the entire Bagg farm, ,
with the buildings situate thereon, with the right and privilege
to forever divert the waters of the brook and use same for the
 benefit of the city.”
But meantime the needs of the city had increased to such an
extent that in the very same report in which they announced the
taking of Tannery Brook, the commissioners petitioned the city
council for “authority to take the necessary steps for securing
a foothold by purchase or otherwise, for the diversion of any or
all water courses that in their judgment are practicable to the |
use of the city as an additional water supply.” In its last meeting
|
|

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
of the year, the council gave the authority asked for, and the
necessary permission of the Legislature was obtained at its next 
session.

The point immediately in view was the Whiting Street Brook,
and the board took prompt action to construct reservoir there. ,
A substantial stone dam was built, feet long, feet thick on
top and feet at the bottom, with feet at its extreme height |
above bed rock. The work was completed by deepening the
channel of the brook, cutting and clearing away from its banks
the brush for distance of two and one half miles from the dam,
and enclosing about two acres with barbed wire fence.

The new reservoir, which is thirty feet higher than the
ponds, and has flowage area of one acre, furnished enough
water for the needs of the upper part of the city, except for a
few weeks in midsummer. Besides, the greater head from this
source largely increased the efficiency of the Fire Department.

| In the winter of this year there was great deal of trouble }

experienced from the freezing of pipes, and the whole available
force of the board was employed in thawing them out. In
March, the frost drill, which had been used for short time in
 was again employed, and, with an improvement suggested
by Superintendent Hardy, was very efficacious. full description of this simple but wonderful contrivance may be found in
the report of the commissioners for  .

The next year,  saw carried out the original plan of
having two independent lines of pipe from the ponds, at cost
of twenty-one thousand dollars. In preliminary steps were
taken for building storage reservoir on the Whiting Street
Brook, as had been contemplated from the beginning. The
necessary land was taken, plans drawn, and the contract for
building the dam awarded to Delaney Bros. This work was
nearly completed in  and put into use the next year.

The dam was “built of hard, close-grained sandstone,
pointed and grouted with Rosendale cement. The earth under
the dam for feet of its entire length is very compact and
unyielding, gravelly hard pan; for the remaining distance the
dam rests on rock foundation, and here benches were cut,

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD. |
deepest on the water side, to connect the structure more closely
with the foundation. The length of the dam is feet, and
its greatest height feet above the natural surface.” The
reservoir has flowage area of acres, watershed of  
, square miles, and capacity of gallons, all
available. ,
The summer of was exdingly dry, and although, in
April, the ponds and the new reservoir were full to overflowing,
the waste water of the latter running away in stream feet
wide and feet deep,—and this for several weeks,—by September street sprinkling had to be discontinued, and by the middle
of December the water at the gate house at Wright’s Pond was
  feet inches deep or inches only above the danger point, or
what is considered the danger point. Hence we are not surprised to find this statement in the report of the board dated the
same month: “This year’s experience shows us that with our
reservoirs full of water in the spring, we cannot pass through an :
extremely dry summer without approaching dangerously near the
limit. And if the reservoirs should not fill during the winter
and spring, and the next season should be dry, contingency not
‘at all improbable, our condition would be extremely critical.”
The very next year the contingency alluded to was upon us.
The amount of water in the reservoirs was unusually small, and
exdingly vexatious conditions existed throughout the year.
The use of hose for watering lawns, washing windows, etc., had
to be entirely prohibited. This led to an immediate movement
towards procuring new supply. Various places were visited
and examined, and opinions solicited from distinguished engineers.
No less than seven different plans received more or less consideration.

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  

 Pumping water from Willimansett Brook directly into the
city pipe.

 Driven wells on the sand plains of Chicopee.

 Munn Brook, with conduit connecting into Ashley and a
storage reservoir at Granville.

Time and space will not permit dwelling upon all these
plans, which are fully discussed in the admirable report of
Engineer McClintock to tbe board, which is published in connection with their report of  but one or two cannot be passed
over. To the use of Hampton ponds there were three
objections:

 An analysis of the water by the State Board of Health
showed it to be far below the average in purity.

 Ashley is about seventy feet higher than Hampton, which
would make it necessary to pump all the water used.

 The area of the watershed is quite limited.

In regard to the Bachelder Brook scheme, it was found that
the surface of pond raised by forty-foot dam would still be
one hundred feet lower than Ashley, so that all the water would
have to be lifted one hundred feet, which, of course, would require
several gallons of water passing through the wheel to lift one
gallon into Ashley. The other projects, except the last, were
objectionable either on account of the cost of maintenance or the 
limited or uncertain nature of the supply.

So by process of elimination, the Munn Brook was left. At
the same time, Mr. James L. Tighe, who commenced to serve the
board as its engineer in June,  and whose services have been
invaluable from that day to this, presented most interesting
report, which amounted to demonstration that the Munn Brook
project was not only feasible, but would be an almost ideal
solution of the city’s great problem. |

In accordance with the views of the engineers, petition
praying for the right to take said waters was sent to the Legislature. Strong objections were entered on the part of Westfield,
and, after an extended hearing, the matter was referred to the
next General Court, which finally gave the decision against
Holyoke.

. REPORT OF WATER BOARD.
While this question was still in abeyance, another dry summer,  put in an appearance, and in August, as the reservoirs
were becoming very low, the State Board of Health was con- .
sulted as to the advisability of pumping water from the Connecticut directly into the pipes from the Whiting Street Reservoir.
The chief engineer reported that in his opinion it would endanger
the health of the community, and the project was dropped.
Disappointed, but not disheartened, by the failure to get
Munn’s Brook, the board soon turned its attention to the southwest branch of the Manhan River, at Southampton. This rises
in the town of Westhampton, and flows in southerly direction,
passing Southampton, to the northern boundary of Westfield.
Here it takes very sharp curve to the northeast, passing close
to Southampton Village, and thence towards Easthampton,
within mile of which it unites with the north branch, the two
forming the Manhan River, which flows into the Ox Bow of the
Connecticut River. The report of Mr. Tighe, recommending this
plan, shows very clearly what was afterwards done. “The
scheme proposed is,” he says, “to divert the head waters of the
southwest branch of the Manhan River, at the point of confluence,
or short distance below it, of the Manhan and Tucker brooks,
and convey them into Ashley ponds. The elevation at the proposed point is feet higher than high-water mark at Ashley, |
or feet higher than the Holyoke dam. With thishead of ,
feet, clean cast-iron pipe, inches in diameter and miles |
in length, will convey gallons per day, or ,
when incrustated, thus having discharging capacity sufficient !
to increase our daily supply to gallons per day, or, in
other words, to render sufficient supply for Holyoke under
normal conditions for twenty-five years.”
This time the Legislature was favorable and granted the
prayer of the commissioners, though the rights of Southampton
were fully protected by Section of the enabling act, which
reads: “Provided that the city of Holyoke shall, when constructing its pipe line through the town of Southampton, place a
Y branch in said line not less than inches in diameter, at
such point as may be designated by the selectmen, and whenever |
|

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
the town of Southampton shall vote to construct water works, it
may connect its pipes with that of Holyoke, and draw not to
exd gallons daily for each inhabitant, without expense to
said town.”

By August the plans had been determined upon and contract
made with Fred S. Ley, of Springfield, to construct an intake
reservoir with an earthen dam having concrete core, and the
work was nearly completed before cold weather set in. Under
the contract was included “cleaning and grubbing the reservoir
and dam site, and removing whatever might endanger the
permanency of the work or the purity of the water.” The total
length of the dam is feet from its extreme end to the overflow. Its width is feet, with slight crown in the middle.

In connecting this reservoir with the ponds, great care was
exercised in selecting the course of the pipe, so as to obtain the
best possible result from an economical as well as from the
engineering standpoint, and all bends and curves, both horizontal
and vertical, were laid with radii not less than one thousand feet.
So skillfully were the plans laid and the details attended to, that
the whole line was constructed of straight pipe feet in length,
without single special casting. So far as we know, it is the first
cast-iron pipe of its length and size in this country with all its
bends and curves Jaid with radii of such length. The work was
completed earlyin  The reservoir was christened Fomer,”
and on May  of that year water was for the first time let through
the entire ten and half miles of pipe.

The results of this new addition to the city’s water supply
were at once apparent. The next year,  furnished the
longest and driest dry season since the inception of the water
works, and, while other cities and towns were full of anxiety and
resorted to great expense to avoid serious calamity, Holyoke
moved on her way with perfect serenity, having an abundant
supply of wholesome water.

Our water supply was now almost ideal, except in one
particular. In quantity, quality, and wholesomeness, it was all
that could be desired. But its pressure was not sufticiently great
to secure ample fire protection in all parts of the city. The

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.

board, not stopping to rest upon the laurels already won, at once
set out to obtain the required pressure, and thus make the supply
a model one in every respect.

Three plans were considered by Engineer Tighe, all of them
practicable:

,  direct bigh service system, by cutting off from the mainpipe system that portion in which high service is desirable, and
establishing high pressure by power, that is, by pumping from
Ashley or Whiting Street Reservoir directly into the pipes, in
which the pressure could be regulated by the power of the
pumps.

 To pump into standpipe or reservoir located on Crafts —
Hill, from which the pressure would be furnished by gravity; and

 To build high-service reservoir on Tatro Brook, one of
the principal feeders of Ashley.

The last plan seemed the best from every point of view, and
was adopted. The task of preparing the basin for the new reservoir was gigantic one. It was commenced in  laid aside
for two years, and taken up vigorously again in  Besides
a great amount of underbrush, there was an almost endless array
of stumps,—some by actual count,—making pile, after
they were dug out, from to feet wide and feet high,
extending the full length of the reservoir. After they had succumbed to fire, there were twenty acres of muck to be dealt
with, and thousands upon thousands of loads were dumped into
a convenient ravine. Below the muck was gravelly subsoil,
then clay, and below this another layer of sand.

The dam is feet long and feet high at the gate house.
It has uniform width of feet on top, with  -foot roadway,
with grass on either side and on the outside slope.

The entire work, both of preparing the reservoir and constructing the dam, has been done by the Water Department,
under direction of its engineer, Mr. Tighe. |

The area of the reservoir is acres, and its capacity some
  gallons. Its height above Ashley overflow is  
feet. Its entire cost was about The masonry core ,

 few points have been passed over or merely alluded to in

the above historical survey which merit more consideration.
| The policy of the Water Department in purchasing land so :

as to control the watersheds has béen considerably criticized at

times, but the far-sighted wisdom of the course is now generally

acknowledged. Similar policy would have saved one of our sister

cities much of the trouble and inconvenience with which she is

struggling to-day.

The water commissioners have made special point of looking after the cleanliness of the property bordering on the ponds. —
It is regularly patrolled by men of the department, and great vigilance is exercised in protecting the waters in the reservoirs from
all pollution. Careful consideration has been given to the beauty
of the surroundings also, and now the entire system presents
somewhat the appearance of series of parks, where everything
unsightly has been removed, and every attention given to beautifying and making attractive.

In meters were placed in each manufacturing establishment using city water. The rates established were said to be
lower than in any other place in the country, that for the smallest
monthly use being one-half and for the largest use one sixth of the
rates of Boston, Cambridge, Providence, and New York. It may
be remarked also that the ordinary water rates are the lowest of .
any city in the Union, the rate per family being  per year.
While the policy of installing meters generally throughout the city
has been the subject of more or less discussion privately, it has
never béen formally considered by the board.

It may be noted here that since the opening of the Fomer
Reservoir accurate measurements have been taken daily, so that
the exact amount of water passing into the main is known, as also
the amount yielded by the watershed, the results tallying very
closely with the calculations of Engineer Tighe before the
reservoir was in existence. And the department is now placing
two  -inch meters, made by the National Meter Company of
New York, and two Venturi meters, one  -inch and one  -inch,

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD. |
for the purpose of measuring accurately all water coming into
the city. ,

The mains are controlled by valves placed at each cross |
street. All service pipes from the main to the curb are controlled
by the Water Department, who have recently adopted the tinlined pipe. .

It has been the policy of the board to put in  -inch, two- and
three-way hydrants at intervals of five hundred feet. valve is
placed in the hydrant pipe, between the hydrant and main, for
protection. These hydrants are in charge of the Water Department, and one man is assigned to the special duty of looking after
all public hydrants. He attends all fires and sees that the
hydrants used are properly closed. No one is allowed to use or
touch apublic hydrant without permission of the department, and
all such use is under the supervision of the superintendent.

By special act of the Legislature in  the city was
allowed the right to tax the property of the Water Department,
upon its construction, at the regular rate of taxation for private
property, and the department in turn charges each municipal
department for all water used, the Fire Department paying an
annual rental of eight dollars per bydrant. This law was petitioned for by the mayor and water commissioners jointly, and
became operative in  Its motive was found in somewhat
general feeling that the Water Department, being successful
and prosperous business enterprise, should bear its share of the
municipal burden. Its operation has caused noticeable diminution in the amount of water used in the public buildings.

There is one feature in our pipe system which must be of
some interest, at least to the uninitiated. It is where three pipe
lines, namely, two  -inch and  -inch line, are fed by single
 -inch line.

As already stated in this paper, the original pipe line from Asbley Reservoir was built of two sizes of cast iron pipe—  inches
in diameter for the first feet and inches for the remainder. The larger size was laid through hill feet in length,
where great part of the excavation was over feet in depth
and considerable of it was rock. The carrying capacity of this

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
line was sufficient for the requirements of the city until the year
  when second  -inch line was laid from the end of the
 -inch main to the city. ,

As the years went by the pressure in the business centers of
the city gradually decreased until, in  it was only pounds
at the City Hall, where it was formerly pounds. The situation was becoming rather serious and demanded prompt attention.
The laying of another pipe through the feet or so of hill |
would be an expensive and difficult work, especially since the
excavation of the first pipe line was not made wide enough for a
second pipe and, besides, the trench excavated was practically all
refilled. ‘To overcome this difficulty and save expense the prop- osition was advanced by the Engineering Department that if a
third pipe line inches in diameter was connected at the end of
the rock cut, so called, with the  -inch pipe in the same manner
as the two  -inch lines the pressure would be increased at least.
  pounds. The proposition of having  -inch pipe feed two
 -inch pipes and  -inch pipe and increase the pressure besides could not but appear absurd to the lay mind. However, the
water commissioners were finally convinced of its practicability.
The  -inch pipe line was laid and the correctness of the proposition demonstrated as the pressure was increased at once by an
average of pounds, bringing back the pressure at the City Hall
to pounds. ,

One matter which may not be passed over in paper of this
kind has not yet been alluded to. In common with many other
places, the board has had long and perplexing fight with the
unpleasant odor and taste which occasionally characterized the
water. This first began to be noticeable in the fall of  ,
though tradition has it that back in or Wright’s Pond
was badly affected and its waters even discolored. But in October,  the water commenced to have fishy taste and to emit
an offensive odor when boiled. It rapidly grew worse. “Eel
juice” was its common appellation, and the term sufficiently describes it. thorough flushing of the mains was resorted to without effect. Then, on the theory that the cause might be found in
the swampy bottom of part of Wright’s Pond, the water of the

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.
latter was drawn down as low as possible, and the pure water of
Ashley admitted. This made no appreciable difference. Samples of water taken from different points in the two ponds, and also
from house faucets in the city, were submitted to Professor Goessmann of the Massachusetts Agricultural College, who had made
the original analyses for the Water Supply Committee. He
reported that there was no material difference in the s; mples, and
, that the chemical analyses showed practically the same result as
. in  About the end of March the offensive taste and odor suddenly and mysteriously disappeared after stay of five months,
during which neither the most careful microscopic examination
nor chemical analysis revealed the presence of any disturbing or
noxious element in the water, and it is by no means certain that
any of the measures resorted to for the purpose of mitigating or
removing the evil had any effect whatever.

In February the ponds were visited by Professor Nichols of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was then employed
in investigating the peculiar condition of one of Boston’s reservoirs. In his report, while mentioning several theories that
seemed more or less plausible, he said, “I do not feel that we possess sufficient evidence as yet to justify us in adopting any theory.”
The trouble recurred at intervals, butin was worse than ever
before. The local paper teemed with essays from indignant citizens on, “What Ails our Water?” and kindred subjects, while its
columns were largely used by engineers to lash each other’s pet

theories. The assurance that whatever the trouble was, it did
not impair the healthfulness of the water, did not seem to satisfy
people in general, and the lives of the water commissioners were
made burden to them. In their perplexity they consulted distinguished engineers, among them Mr. J. N. Tubbs, chief engineer
of the water works of Rochester, N. Y. In his report he expressed

a belief that the trouble was caused by the “disintegration and death
of microscopic plant organisms which, at certain period of their
growth, become detached from stalk or bottom, and for time
remain suspended at or near the surface of the water.” He |
recommended, therefore, the extension of the main pipe several
hundred feet out into the pond, to where the water is thirty feet

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
deep, and also that when the water was low the exposed bottom
should be covered with gravel. Engineer Herschel was also consulted, and made recommendations. However, on account of the
acknowledged uncertainty as to the cause, no action was taken

towards carrying out any of the recommendations.

In the spring of there was fresh invasion of the old .
evil, the disagreeable taste and odor appearing in full strength.
The hydrants were opened and the mains flushed at intervals, both
in the day time and at night, but without apparent effect. Finally,
by invitation of the commissioners, the State Board of Health
came to Holyoke and investigated. Their conclusion was that
already reached by Engineer Tighe, namely, that the principal
cause of the evil was Uroglena, microscopic animalcule, which
for long time were classified as plants. The cause of their sudden appearance and disappearance is still an unsolved problem.
The Water Board of Holyoke, accepting this theory, and finding,
after careful testing, no traces of Uroglena in the Fomer, Whiting Street, and Tannery reservoirs, made new arrangement
whereby, when the Uroglena appear, the offending pond can be
cut off from the mains and sent to the hospital, as it were, until it
recovers. Thus they believe that they have won the long fight,
and that the unpalatable condition of the water will soon be but

. an odorous memory.

The flowage area of the reservoirs now in existence, including the high-pressure reservoir, is feet. The area of the
watersheds of Ashley, Wright’s, and Whiting Street is square
miles and their available storage capacity is gallons.
This is large reservoir development, and makes available daily
yield of gallons for each square mile of watershed.
Practically speaking, it makes available almost the entire total
yield of the watersheds, and further development on these sheds
might be well questioned from the standpoint of economy.

The watershed of the Fomer, which has an area of  
square miles, has several sites for large storage reservoirs which,
when developed, will furnish daily yield of gallons.
At present there is only an intake reservoir of gallons
capacity. About miles above this intake is site for stor  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.

age reservoir, where dam feet high and feet long will
impound gallons on an area of acres. The development of this reservoir, or one of the others on the watershed,
will command the attention of the water department in the near
future. This will make available from our watersheds, with an
area of square miles, yield of gallons per day,
or quantity sufficient, allowing gallons per capita, to supply
a population of  .

The water supply of Holyoke is now model one. There
ig an abundance of pure, wholesome water for all the needs of
the present, and plans have been definitely laid to meet the
exigencies of the future. It stands to-day lasting monument
to the wisdom, energy, integrity, and skill of those who have had
it in charge. REPORT OF WATER BOARD.
