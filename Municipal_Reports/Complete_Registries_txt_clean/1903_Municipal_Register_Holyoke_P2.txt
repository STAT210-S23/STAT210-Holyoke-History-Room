, SEWERS. |
The inch Akron pipe sewer laid in Hampden street, from
Nonotuck street to the manhole at the intersection of the alley |
east of ‘Taylor street, and discussed in the report of this
department, has been completed at total cost of or ,
$  per running foot. ae |
The wisdom of laying this sewer has been already shown, as
flooded cellars from surface water and sewage are things of the
past in that neighborhood. »
The other sewers constructed during the year are as follows:
A ro inch Akron pipe in Dwight street westerly from the sewer
in alley between High and Maple street for distance of about
  feet; inch Akron pipe in Sycamore street from the sewer
in Appleton street southerly for distance of feet; and the
extension northerly of the inch sewer in Northampton street
north of Lincoln street for distance of feet or to the old
Fairfield homestead. |
A large map, on scale of feet to the inch, showing
the sewer systems of the city, has been. made. This map has
drawn upon it all sewers of which there are any records or of
which there is any knowledge, together with their lengths, sizes,
and material of which they are made. :
Although considerable time was given and the greatest
pains taken to compile complete map of every sewer in the
city, there are still sewers, or portions of sewers, laid in the
earlier days of which there are no records or any other information from which they could be traced. ‘These sewers can eventually be found when new connections are being made with them
by abutters. ,
The coming year, it is the intention of this department to.
make set of detailed maps showing the location of all sewers, ,
water pipes, gas mains and telephone conduits laid in the streets,
also all property lines abutting the same. ‘These maps will be
of great value, when laying further extensions, especially to the
different departments and corporations using the streets, as
proper location and aligument can be made without interfering

The most important work done in the highway department
during the year has been the change of grade and part of the loca- |
tion of the Springfield road, so-called, between Berkshire street |
and the Springdale school house. This portion of the street, |
as is well known, had always been impassible at times of high !
water in the Connecticut River, thus causing the suspension of }

BRIDGES.

Under this heading the most important work done was the
laying of new floorway on eight spans of the county bridge
between this city and South Hadley Falls. The doing of this
work raised point of contention between the city and the

 Holyoke Street Railway Company, the former maintaining that
the Street Railway Company should stand the total expense of
doing the work of that portion of the flooring used by the company, or, in other words, that portion between the truss and a
point two feet beyond the outer rail, while the latter maintained
that it was, according to law, only obliged to pay the cost of the
top or surface planking, and that the cost of the under planking
and all other incidental work should be borne by the city.

Notice was served by the city on the county commissioners
of both Hampden and Hampshire counties of the unsafe condition of the bridge.

The latter appointed hearing, but, prior to the date set
for this, the city and Street Railway Company came to an
agreement regarding the cost of doing the work, and the case
was dismissed without prejudice by the county commissioners.

The terms of agreement were in substance that the Holyoke
Street Railway Company will build and maintain, to the satisfaction of the city, portion of the bridge flooring over which the
track is laid ten feet in width from the easterly truss.

The other bridges of the city are in fair condition. HowREPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.  
ever some of the older ones that were never designed to carry
the heavy traffic to which they are now subjected should be replaced, when the city can afford to do so, by stronger and more
modern structures.

Some fears have been expressed by the public as to the stability of the Dwight street foot bridge crossing the Boston and
Maine Railroad. ‘The condition of this bridge will be reported
on later in special report after thorough examination is made
of the structure by this department. |

MAPLE STREET CULVERT EXTENSION.

The Maple street culvert has been extended feet on the
westerly side and feet on the easterly side. ‘The abutments
of the culvert are constructed of rubble masonry laid in American cement mortar, while in the arch, constructed of five courses
of brick, Portland cement mortar was used.

The bed of the brook which the culvert spans was paved
with large flaggers inches in thickness, the interstices in the
pavement being filled with Portland cement concrete.

In portions of the older sections of the culvert, from unequal settlement or some other cause, cracks or fissures had been
observed in the arch. At these points, and for some distance
either side of them, the arch was re-inforced or strengthened by
four rings or courses of brick laid in Portland cement mortar.

All the work was done by contract by Lynch Brothers ata

WORK FOR THE PARK COMMISSIONERS.
The plans of the Park Commissioners, for the improvement
and beautifying of our public parks, necessarily entail additional work upon the engineering department. The time devoted to the interests of other departments can hardly be
appreciated by those not familiar with the service of the engineering corps. The engineering work for the Park Commissioners
during the past year, including field work, supervision of construction, etc., would aggregate over thirty days for one man,
and the office work, including maps, studies, plans, specifications,
etc., would amount to fully the same period of time.
The extension of our park areas and the development of ,
areas already devoted to park purposes will of necessity increase
the demands of the Park Commission upon this department.

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.  
WORK FOR THE MUNICIPAL LIGHTING PLANT.
The work of improving and developing the municipal
lighting plants will unquestionably demand more or less service
from the engineering department in the future. During the
past year plans for the offices of the lighting department and
drawings for important changes made at the electric lighting station, also maps showing the location of poles and of new
lights were prepared by this department. About one month of
time for one man has been devoted to this work by the engineering staff.
| The service demanded of the city engineering department
by the lighting department is entirely new, having developed
with the installation of municipal lighting department, and
must of necessity add to the labor and expense of the engineering department.
WATER WORKS
The construction of the dam and dike at the High Pressure
Reservoir and the laying of two miles or thereabouts of twenty
inch cast iron pipe called for considerable of the time of your
Engineer the past year. But this was not all. Your Engineer
has also given vast amount of time and study to biological
work in seeking the cause of the disagreeable odors and tastes
found in the spring season in the water furnished from Ashley
Reservoirs. This study called for painstaking microscopical
examinations or analyses of the water both out at the reservoirs
and from the faucets in the city. On the strength of the information derived from these analyses plan has been effected by
the Water Board which warrants palatable water to the public
in the future and the good riddance of disagreeable feature of
our public water supply for all time. Many efforts, especially
in the earlier days of the water department, were made to this
end, all of which were entirely unsuccessful. It should therefore
be very gratifying to the water department, if it has sucded
in eliminating from the water supply this very unpleasant fea| !

ture of thirty years’ standing, or since the inception of the
works. ,

The magnitude of the engineering work in the water department has never been fully realized by the public. It is, too,
generally speaking, work of highly scientific character involving difficult problems to which ample time and careful study
have to be given if good results are to be attained.
 The failure of street sidewalk or sewer built from faulty designs entails little if any loss beyond the first cost of the work,
but should large pipe under high pressure, or the dam of a
storage reservoir, impounding millions and millions of gallons
of water, burst, what results might be expected? The destruction that would follow, especially in the latter case, can be more
easily imagined than described.

CITY MAP.

During the year this department has finished and published
a map of the city which was commenced in  This map is
made to scale of feet to the inch, the same as the old map
which it replaces, the supply of which had become exhausted.

. Owing to the growth and development of the city, the new
map—although made to the same scale—is nearly twice the
size of the old one. It embraces all of the territory from the
Northampton line on the north to the West Springfield line. on
south, and from the Connecticut River on the east to about a
mile west of Northampton street. Also considerable portions
of South Hadley Falls and Willimansett.

The locations of Ashley Ponds, Whiting Street Reservoir,
and the new High Service Reservoir, now in course of construction, are shown on the new map, as are the principal
streets and highways of West Holyoke. The elevations of
street intersections, Ashley Ponds, Whiting Street Reservoir
and the new High Service Reservoir are also indicated. 

It has been the studious effort of the department to produce map which would meet the wants of the public, one from

REPORT OF THE
Gas and Electric Department.
City oF HOLYOKE, MASss.,
OFFICE OF THE GAS AND ELEcTRIC DEPT.
Dec. .
To the Honorable the Mayor, and the Board of Aldermen.
GENTLEMEN—lI hand you herewith the first annual report of
the Gas and Electric Department. The city received the Gas and
Electric plants from the Holyoke Water Power Co. Dec. ,
so this report is for eleven and one-half months. The gas works
were in fair condition, both as regards the buildings, apparatus. .
and street mains. The generating capacity cf the works is  ,  cubic feet per twenty-four hours; but the purifying capacity
is only rated at cubic feet, disproportion caused by
the addition of the water gas apparatus. The storage capacity
of the holders is also out of proportion, the amount available
being only about cubic feet. At the present time
there is being sent out regularly from the works about  
cubic feet per day, while there will probably be sent out during
the shortest days cubic feet, proportion between
storage and distribution that is entirely unsafe, for if any accident should happen that stopped the making of gas for one-haif
day the city would be without supply for an indefinite time, a
condition of affairsthat would be intolerable. There should be
a storage capacity large enough to supply the city for at least
twenty-four hours, and recommend that immediate plans be

  REPORT OF GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT.
made for the acquisition of the necessary lands and the erection
of holder of capacity of not less than cubic feet.

At the time of the transfer, the buildings at the electric
station were in good condition; but the electrical equipment
was obsolete and overloaded. In the dynamo room there were
twenty-five small dynamos of various kinds and capacities.
Some were for the street arc lights, some for commercial arcs,
others for incandescent lights, and one for power.

The distributing lines of wires and poles were in very poor
condition, poles much decayed, wire with the insulation badly
impaired, and all overloaded.

After mature deliberation and consultation with eminent
electrical engineers, it was deemed best to discard all the electrical machinery at the station, and in place of so many small

. units, install two large ones that would develop electrically all
the power furnished by the water wheels and accomplish it in
an economical manner. There is now in place one of the new
machines, K.W. generator, and another one is on the ground
ready to be put in place as soon as the necessary changes can
be made. The new machines furnish alternating current which
can be used for either power, street or commercial arcs, or incandescent lights. Besides these two new generators, there is

installed new switch-board with its accompanying instruments,
and ten transformers for the street lights. In addition to the
electrical apparatus and machinery, there has been placed a

governor for the water wheels. It is also planned to change the
whole street lighting service to enclosed arcs and add lights
to the in operation at present, making total of street
lamps. Lamps and equipment are already at hand.

When all the plans that are under way for the station are

consummated the City will have an up-to-date electric install. ation: but will not be properly equipped for steam power. When

all the business that is in sight has been taken on,  per cent.

of the capacity of the water wheels and generators will have

been used up, leaving only small margin for growth. In order

to be in condition to take on what new business will come, and

to equalize the steam power with the electrical generation, it

REPORT OF GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT.  
will be necessary to make immediate plans for further extensions, both of the electrical machinery and power to run same.
I here recommend that the necessary steps be taken as early ,
in the year as possible, to acquire such installation. Said equipment should, in my opinion, consist of at least per cent. more
generating capacity and steam power enough to drive all elec- |
trical machinery.
The following is the financial statement of the department:

FREDERICK S. FULLER,
Public Accountant. ,
Dec. |
The gas works consist of retort house containing ten benches,
of six retorts each, for the making of coal gas, capable of generating cubic feet of gas per twenty-four hours, and two
vertical h. p. Manning boilers, water gas building with one |
set of water gas apparatus of capacity of cubic. feet
per twenty-four hours, coal shed, capable of storing tons of ,
coal, one building containing exhausters, condensers and purifiers; one building in which are pipe shop, meter rooms and
storage; three gasometers, three oil tanks, five tar wells, and
two storage sheds. :
At the time of taking over the properties, there were  
miles of street mains laid and meters set. During the past
year there have been laid miles of street main, feet
small mains abandoned, service pipes run and meters
set, making total of miles of main pipes in the streets
and meters set. There has been one bench equipped with
retorts, iron work and hydraulic main, and tar extractor added
to the condensing apparatus. ‘There have been six benches of
retorts renewed.
The electric station consists of boiler house, engine room,
dynamo or generator building and wheel house covering the
Wheel pit. ‘The buildings are all in good condition. In the

  REPORT OF GAS AND ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT.

boiler house, there are installed five upright Manning boilers of

r  h. p. each, making total of horse power. The room
was designed for fourteen boilers of same size as these in use.
There are two h. p. engines installed with space for their.
duplication. These engines are simple single cylinder machines,
that were placed there as makeshifts, when there was no water

for the water wheels. They are not designed for economical
running, as their use is limited. |

In the wheel pit are four h. p. water wheels which are

. capable of using up all of the sixteen mill powers that are allotted to the plant.

At the time of the transfer, there were customers using
electricity. There have been added since  making total
number of customers  ‘There were meters in use. There
have been added since  making total of  There were
eight transformers in use. Set during the year,  total  .
There were miles of wire strung and there have been added

that had decayed so they were unsafe. It will probably be a
year before the lines of poles and wires can be all brought into
a proper condition.

The following tables present data from the workings of the
gas works. similar statement of the workings at the electric
station cannot be compiled, as there were no appliances installed
from which to get the necessary records.

Profit and loss, 
It will be seen from the working accounts, that the gas
works have made profit of while the electric station
Shows loss of It would seem just to the users of
gas and electricity, that each plant should be considered as oo
unit instead of the department as whole, so if there were ever |
achance to reduce the price of either, the customers might
receive the benefit. As the gas plant shows it can meet its expenses with smaller income, it is proposed that on bills due on
and after May ist, the price for gas shall be  per thousand
cubic feet with discount of cents per thousand, making the
net price  per thousand cubic feet, instead of  as at )
present. .
As the Revised Laws require that neither gas nor electricity
Shall be sold for less than the cost of generating them, it does
hot seem expedient to change the price of the latter. The prospect of the coming year is for an increasing income, and also that
by the end of it we may be able to reduce the price of electricity.

REPORT OF THE ,
INSPECTOR OF MILK, VINEGAK
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR, |
City Hatt, HoLyoKkE, MAss.,  .
To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen:

I have the honor to submit herewith the following report as
Inspector of Milk, Vinegar and Petroleum for the City of Holyoke for the year ending November  oth,  .

MILK.
Total number of licenses granted,  
Number granted to peddlers,  
Number granted to stores and stands,  
Number granted for sale of oleomargarine,..  
Ihave paid into the City Treasury as license fees

received, $ 
I have paid into the City Treasury money received :

for distilled water, etc, 
Number of quarts of sweet milk sold in the city daily

is. .  
Number of quarts of skimmed milk sold daily is  
Number of quarts of cream sold daily is  

  INSPECTOR OF MILK, VINEGAR AND PETROLEUM.

Making the total number of quarts of milk sold this past
year  and of cream  which at the retail value
of milk and cream as sold in this city amounts to .
Number of milk samples tested,  
Number of butter samples tested,  
Number of vinegar samples tested,  
Number of kerosene oil samples tested,  
Number of prosecutions, I
Number of warnings sent,  

The prosecution was for selling milk of not good standard
quality. The party selling the milk received two warnings but
paid no attention to them, and was fined  in the police
court. All the other warnings that have given have been
obeyed and have had no occasion to send second.

Of the samples of milk tested, only were of such
low standard as to deserve warning, which speaks very well
for the quality of the milk sold here.

I have had complaints from four private parties, claiming
their milk was bad and caused sickness. On investigation I
found that one came from sick cow, and ordered the milk not
to be sold. The other three found the fault with the parties
themselves, caused by improper handling after receiving it from
the peddlers.

I have warned several peddlers to clean their wagons and
keep them so. This has had good effect, but there is chance
for further improvement. number of stores have been ordered
to keep their milk with more regard to cleanliness. In this

. work have been helped very much by Health Officer Linehan.

The use of wooden plugs for stopping milk cans is not

right. They will absorb more or less of the milk, and it is
almost impossible to thoroughly clean them, and being tainted,
: will surely contaminate new milk.

I would recommend that the Board of Health make rule

that any peddler or dealer using wooden plugs shall order their
license revoked, and not order it renewed until they comply with
the rules. Fe

|
|
INSPECTOR OF MILK, VINEGAR AND PETROLEUM. |
I wish to call attention to the wav milk is kept in some
stores: sometimes the can stands in the middle of the floor with |
the measure on top of it, sometimes it stands on the same bench |
that meat is cut on, with the measure beside it, and in many
other exposed places where it catches the dust and germs that
are there.
I would recommend that no license be granted to anv party
that did not keep their milk in an entirely separate place from
everything else and keep that piace clean.
Milk can be dangerously contaminated in an unsanitary
store.
) VINEGAR. |
I have tested samples of vinegar, and have found them
all of standard quality.
OLEOMARGARINE.
I have tested but five samples of butter and they proved to
be all right.
The State Inspectors are active here, so do not interfere
with them.
The State Agent of the Dairy Bureau has prosecuted several
parties for selling ‘‘ Renovated Butter,” the butter not being
marked as the law requires. They were all fined in the Police
Court.
PETROLEUM.
I have tested samples from tank cars of kerosene oil and
from tank wagon loads that came from Springfield. found
one wagon load that was very poor quality and forbade its sale.
That stopped that quality of oil from being brought here.
Last December had complaints through the Board of
Health and private parties that the oil they were getting was of
poor quality, that is, that it did not burn well. took  

  INSPECTOR OF MILK, VINEGAR AND PETROLEUM.
samples from as many stores in different parts of the city, and
located the trouble in one store which had by accident allowed
water to get into their storage tank. .

, By order of Health Officer Linehan the tank was cleaned
out and inspected by him and myself, with the result that there
have been no more complaints.

I have had great assistance from Health Officer and the
Board of Health, also from my collector of samples.

I thank the City Marshal and the patrolmen for the help
they have given me.

Respectfully submitted,
| JAMES K. MORRILL,
Inspector of Milk and Vinegar.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE
PARK COMMISSIONERS.
To His Honor the Mayor and Board of Aldermen.

GENTLEMEN: In accordance with the established usage,
this board has the honor to present herewith the records of
their department for the past year, trusting that it may meet with
your approval and that the recommendation herewith suggested
may have your hearty cooperation.

The year passed has been an uneventful one so far as
making any additions to our present area or any important improvements to same: again were we disappointed in not having
sufficient funds at our disposal to enable us to prod with the
contemplated improvements and the development of Elmwood
Park for which we have had plans prepared. As the development and improvement of our parks depends entirely upon the
amount set aside for that purpose by yourselves, it can be
readily seen that nothing in that line can be accomplished,
when we are allowed only enough for bare maintenance of the
simplest kind. That the citizens of our city will have just cause .
to regret the action of our city fathers in failing to do their part
in not providing sufficient funds for such additions and developements, there will be no donbt, for the time is not far distant
when public sentiment will be aroused and demand larger and
better recreation grounds and the question then will be, not
where are we to get the money, but where can we obtain the
land. Each year sees the absorption of available lands for that
purpose by citizens and corporations who are erecting buildings
thereon and we shall finally be obliged to establish our parks

  REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS.
outside the city limits, but which will never take the place of
small parks in the various parts of the city.

In our previous report we have recommended securing a
tract of land in Ward one fora park which was badly needed
but since then the only available tract in that locality has been
purchased by corporation which makes it unobtainable. The
same is also true in South Holyoke where additions are quite a
necessity but such tracts as we considered available have been
reserved for other purposes, and now out of the market at any
price. Thus have we been obliged to let opportunities pass
by to secure suchavailable lands that shouldhave been obtained
for additions to our already very limited park areas, which at
the present time consists of total of only acres. most
miserly amount fora city whose population is made up so largely
of working people whose principal recreation is their sojourn to
these places after their labors of the day are over.

The most notable improvements have been made on Prospect, Germania and Canonchet Parks. On Prospect Park, additions to the children’s play grounds have been made; here we

have placed Sand Courts for the very young and large swings
and Merry-go-round for the older ones. They have been
largely patronized and thoroughly enjoyed, especially the Merrygo-round which has been crowded day and night, only stopping
when the curfew was sounded. Additional flowers and shrubs
have been placed through the parks adding much to the beauty
of the place.

The Women’s Sanitary continues to be popular and great
convenience to the public, an attendance of for the past
year being reported.

We continue to advocate the erection of suitable stone
wall to take the place of the unsightly fence now there, both as
a matter of safety and improvement in the appearance of the
park from the railroad.

A suitable place for the storage of our settees and tools,
etc., is badly needed. We are adding yearly to our force and at
present they are scattered in different parts of the city, not all
on park property. ‘hey do not receive the care that they should,

REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS.  
neither can we keep strict account of same or have them under our immediate supervision. It is therefore not only essential but as matter of economy that suitable building should
be erected on the park at an early date where workshop could
be established for various repairs (which are quite source of
expense ),which could be combined with suitable place for the
storage of tools, settees and also to include sanitary for men.
For such building, plans have been submitted to the board by
our city engineer, which can be utilized when we have appropriation at our disposal suthcient for the erection of same and
which we trust may be considered advisable at an early date.

 On Germania Park we have erected the first of number of
Men’s Sanitaries, intended for the various parks. This was
somewhat of an experiment and it was thought best to thoroghly test the same there before erecting others, but it has proven
such great convenience without being the least objectionabie
that it is considered advisable to make further improvements in
this direction.

Canonchet Park has been the scene of much activity in the
line of improvements and many changes have been made. New
stone steps at the north east and south east corners have been
put in and new concrete walks have been laid covering the lower
half including circle in the center. Here will be placed the
drinklng fountain which will have an ornamental electric lightand water cooler for ice water, the foundations for which have
been completed and which it is intended to erect early next
spring; broad promenade will extend around the fountain.
For these improvements special appropriation of 
was made, but the nature of the soil was such that the work was
very expensive, consequently we have not only exhausted this
special appropriation but we have paid out from our regular appropriation quite large sum in order to complete the work this
year on that portion of the park. We are desirous of completing these improvements during the coming year and would therefore request anextra appropriation for this purpose.

On Elmwood Park the Board of Public Works have extended the main sewer up the valley for distance of feet

  REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS.

which will now enable us to complete this section of the park
and the entrance to same on Maple street, plans for which have
been prepared by our architects, and we therefore trust you may
deem it advisable to place sufficient funds at our disposal for that
purpose; in regard to additional lands for this park we are now
negotiating for same and hope to have this matter all settled
early in the new year.

We beg to submit herewith statement showing you ex- |
penses for the year together with expense for each of the several
parks, including special appropriations for Canonchet, also |
detailed account of all disbursements, which we trust you may
find correct. |

RECOMMENDATIONS.

We again urge upon you the necessity of placing fund at
the disposal of this board for the purchase of additional lands
for park purposes whenever in their judgment, they may deemtt |
expedient todoso. The main object being to secure such lands
while they may be available even though they may not be de.
veloped for some years to come, also to allow sufficient sum to
enable us to prod with the development of the first section of
Elmwood Park and to complete the improvements on Canonchet

-* Park as well as commencing upon the proposed improvements
on Prospect Park. For that purpose we would recommend the
following appropriations :

For regular maintenance, 

| For Elmwood Park development,  

For Canonchet Park improvements,  

For Prospect Park improvements,  

For Prospect Park storage and sanitary.  

For purchase of lands (by time loans),  

We respectfully submit the foregoing for your approval and
consideration.

During the year the Lyman Mills has entered its annual
protest and appeal against the valuation fixed on its property by
the assessors:

Aside from the case of C. C. Abbey which represented
property which the city had taken, the amount of  paid to
Ellen Delisle, represents the entire expense to which the city
has been put for verdicts and settlements during the past year.
This is somewhat remarkable showing and will probably not
soon happen again. The Police department, Board of Public
Works and City Engineer’s offices have all co-operated with the
Law department in investigating accidents and possible sources
of litigation and the promptness and efficiency with which their
work has been done by these several departments has been a
great protection to the city against the bringing of accident
suits. In closing desire to thank the officials of the city with
whom have come in contact for their courtesy and kindness.

REPORT OF THE :

BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS. City OF HOLYOKE MASSACHUSETTS, December 

Office of the Board of Public Works, :
ffon. Arthur B. Chapin, Mayor, and the Honorable, the Members

of the Board of Aldermen of the City of Holyoke, Mass.

GENTLEMEN :—We beg to present herewith the seventh annual report of this department for the fiscal year ending November ‘

One of the most important pieces of work undertaken was
the raising and straightening of South Main street, or the
Springtield road, so called, from point near Berkshire street to ,
James street, and while this work has not been completed it is
so well under way that the new location can be used early in the
spring of  and if so completed and opened for travel the
Holyoke Street Railway Company has agreed to bear portion of
the expense, not exding ‘This, we believe, in time will
prove of great benefit to the residents of Springdale and other
citizens who have occasion to use this road, which has in the

 past usually been flooded during the period of high water in the
Spring, cutting off communication by foot or car with the south
end of the city.

Other important works in the Highway department,although
the appropriations for this department were limited, were the
construction of macadam roadways upon portions of Centre,
Summer, Sargeant and Hamilton streets, the latter street being
macadamized along its entire length. .

We can add little to the recommendations in the Highway
department over those made in the sixth annual report of this

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.

Board, believing that large expenditure of money is needed in
the improvement of streets which are now in condition which
we believe warrants your early and careful attention.

We have investigated the condition of Main street, and have
had conferences with the Holyoke Street Railway Company
relative to the providing of grooved rails along portion of
that street, in order that improvements in the surface of the
roadway, desired by the residents of that section, might be
made. The president of this company has promised to have on
hand during the spring of sufficient quantity of these
rails to pave such portion of the street as the city under an appropriation which it deems sufficient for the work can accomplish. The Board recommends that start be made upon this
street as early in the year as possible, and while believing that
this work is urgently required, it should not be forgotten that
certain portions of any money appropriated for permanent highway work should be delegated to some other streets, the improvement of which is as urgently needed as that of Maun street.

The road-way of the South Hadley Falls bridge has undergone needed repairs, and has been placed in thoroughly safe
and satisfactory condition to the Board; not only that portion
of the road-way which is used by the general public, but also
the portion occupied by the tracks of the Holyoke Street Railway Company, new work having been substituted for the old
work, and the supporting timbers strengthened in every particular, and heavy steel grooved rails laid. All of the expense of
improving the location on the bridge occupied by the Street
Railway Company was paid by it.

An agreement has also been executed by the Holyoke
Street Railway Company which provides that this company
shall maintain to the satisfaction of the Board ten feet of
the roadway of the bridge occupied by its location.

The cost of the work as done by the city on the bridge this
year amounts to With the exception of the Willimansett
bridge, which was re-planked, little work was done on any of
the bridges, all of them being in very satisfactory condition. 

The public buildings have claimed share of the attention

, REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.  
of the Board, and all of them are now, we believe, in satisfactory
condition.

A large expenditure has been made at the High School, in
changing over and re-arranging certain portions of the heating
and ventilating system, whereby it is claimed by experts that
there will be large percentage of saving, not only in fuel but in
the power required to propel the fans, this power having been
cut down some fifteen horse power already.

Similar work has been done at the Highland Grammar
School building, although not of such an extended nature.

New sanitaries in the girls’ department have been provided
for the South Chestnut Street School, and new sanitaries have
been placed throughout the Appleton Street building.

The bath houses in the four sections of the city have been
maintained to the satisfaction of the general public, and have
continued to be source of accommodation and recreation to a
large number of children and men and women.

We can only hope that suitable and sightly structures can
be provided this year at the city yard. The condition of the
buildings there needs no explanation from this Board, and no
city which cared for its good name would point to similar
buildings with any degree of pride.

Preparations have been made during the fall for the installation next year of large number of additional street lights,
which are to be of enclosed arc pattern, run on high voltage,
and which it is hoped will give better satisfaction than the
present open arcs. It is believed that by the first of March, at
the latest, fully lights will be in operation upon the
streets of our city, doing away with all of the gas and naphtha
torches now in use.

A larger appropriation in the Lighting department will be
needed to meet the expense caused by the operation of these
additional lights.

At an expenditure of something over as shown
elsewhere, roo feet of brick culvert was constructed on the
easterly side of Maple street and an extension of feet was
added to the culvert already existing on the westerly side of the

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.
street at Elmwood Park, furnishing dumping ground for the
Alley department for some years to come.
Owing to the action of the Massachusetts Harbor and Land
Commissioners, which served notice upon the corporations in
' the city using the bank of the Connecticut river as dumping
ground, this Board was compelled to find place for the disposal
of refuse matter other than the river bank in Ward  which it
has been using for some years. ‘The action of the Commission
necessitates the haulage of the debris either to Springdale dumping ground or to the Elmwood Park dump, which will cause an
additional expenditure in rgo  over that of  it is estimated,
of |

We are in hopes that abutters upon the alleys in the rear of
some of our principal streets may be induced to maintain those
alleys in better condition than they have been in  the
past. ‘The paving of certain alleys is urgently needed, and as
the city has no jurisdiction in the alleys other than the laying
and maintaining of certain pipes or sewers, it is necessary for

the abutter to maintain the surface of the alley. It is hoped
that some measures may be adopted whereby the alleys now in
the worst condition can be bettered. ‘Ihe only serious drawback
towards improvement in these alleys is the fact that the abutters
themselves are unable to come to any satisfactory agreement as
to the payment of the expense entailed in making the improvement.

While the citizens in general are cooperating with this
department in the separation of garbage and ashes, there is still
much room for improvement, especially in the tenement house ,
section, where but one garbage or ash box is provided foreach |
block. We recommend that the owners of these blocks provide
one can for garbage on each floor of their blocks, which would,
in large measure, do away with the tenants depositing the
garbage in the ash-chute, causing annoyance not only to the
land-lords, but which also in summer proves offensive to the
entire neighborhood, and also at the dumps.

We are pleased at the establishment of public transfer
station at the corner of Race and Dwight streets, by the Holyoke

'‘ REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.  
Street Railway Company, and we hope that this station will be
provided with public sanitaries, which this Board has offered to
connect with the sewer, free of expense to the company. This is
in line with the recommendation made in the report of  .

We have constructed but four sewers during the past year,
only one of which, the Hampden street sewer, was of any ma- .
terial importance. This is storm water sewer, running from
the alley east of Taylor street, where it connects with the
Hampden street sewer, to Nonotuck street, distance of  
feet, and is laid on an average depth of from eleven to fifteen
feet, its construction being necessary to provide suitable drainage for the surface water which accumulates during heavy rains
and the floods of spring in the little hollow at the intersection
of Nonotuck and Hampden streets, which has in the past been a
source of much annoyance to the abutters, and expense to the
city, in the line of damages.

The recommendations made in past years for additional
sewers in the Highlandsand at Ingleside and Springdale, are
still pertinent. Certain sections of the Highlands are still
unprovided with sewage, and Ingleside is entirely without sewers. It does not seem to us that this should be so. We hope
that some start may be made the coming year upon these systems, even though it might be necessary for the city to establish
a loan.

There are still large number of sidewalks in this city
which should be repaired. There are many new sidewalks yet
to be constructed, and much‘curbing is needed.

We are of the opinion that it would be well for the city to
purchase plant suitable for the construction of sidewalks, and
do the work itself. We have been tied down to the convenience
of contractors, who though usually accomodating have, nevertheless,caused delays which have been annoying. In our opinion
there is no reason why the city cannot do the work as satisfactorily as it has done all manner of municipal work, and as cheap
as the contractor, and at the same time know absolutely the
kind of material which is being put into the sidewalk.

Owing to rate of freight which the Holyoke Street Rail  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WURKS.
