MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
Gentlemen of the Board of Aldermen :—

We hear so much of criticism, many times prompted by
hostility, regarding the actions and work of our public officials and
of the management of our various departments, that it is well to
occasionally consider some of the advantages of our city and the
faithful work of the city officials. The year that has just closed has
been trying one for all the departments, yet the results which
they have accomplished speak well for their conduct and the performance of their duties by the members. believe the work of
the different departments during the past year will compare favorably with that of any city in the Commonwealth.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT.

During the past eight years our city debt had been increasing

at an alarming rate. Previous to this last year it had nearly doubled during the past eight years.

added.

Fund of the Water Commissioners to meet this payment. We have :
paid our running expenses this year without being: compelled to
borrow any money. During the year the amount of back taxes
which our alleged defaulting collector left has been collected and |

This left us with deficit of By the settlement with
the sureties of Mr. Keough’s bonds we have received money enough ,
to meet this indebtedness and leave us with surplus, which has
been transferred to the Sinking Fund, and this year we will start ,
with an unappropriated surplus, available for expending, already in —sT

$ last year’s non-resident bank tax, and the amount
-of  received from dividends of the Holyoke and Westfield
Railroad stock. This road has earned during the past year the
largest amount ever received, and the directors have recently
‘declared dividend of ten per cent. Oe ,
. SCHOOLS.
During the past year there have been many changes made in
our teaching force, especially in that of the Highschool. Our new
Superintendent has already given faithful and efficient work and is
most zealous for the welfare of our puplic school system. It is un‘fortunate that we were not able to provide the new school house on

  MAYOR'S ADDRESS. ,
the Highlands, but the required number of the Board of Aldermen
would not authorize loan for such purpose. According to our |
Charter it is the province of the School Committee to decide on
the location of the lot for the school house, and their decision should
be accepted by the Mayor and Board of Aldermen without any
attempt to coerce them or compel them to change their opinion as
to what in their judgment is for the best interests of the pupils of
any district. The Elmwood school is overcrowded, and something
must be done in that direction to relieve that section. The Spring| dale district also needs more room for its scholars. Our city should
certainly provide sufficient accommodations for all of the pupils
who are desirous and eager to obtain an education. The School |
Department needs this year in addition to the amount
required for school houses.
POLICE DEPARTMENT.
From some of the criticisms of our Police Department which
have been given publicity, one not acquainted with ourcity might —
infer that our citizens were not law-abiding people and that the
laws were not well enforced. The reverse is true however. The
people of the city are law respecting and law abiding. The Police
Department has in the main done good work during the past year,
but the Police Department alone cannot enforce the laws, especially
the liquor laws, unless the public will co-operate and assist. If the
| people who criticise the work of the Police Department and of its
officers would give the department their alleged knowledge of violations of law these instances would be speedily attended to. I
believe that in the main the laws of our city have been well enforced
during the past year. The discipline of the force will be carefully
preserved and maintainted. patrol wagon and signal system have
been added at comparatively small expense, and the efficiency of
the department has been greatly increased by this addition. A
police building is needed, but it will not be possible to provide one
this year.
FIRE DEPARTMENT.
We have added practically three new engines to the Fire Department this year, and the department is now well equipped with

MAYOR'S ADDRESS.  
apparatus, except there is need of combination chemical hose
wagon for the Highlands, which it is hoped can be provided.

Fires during the past year have been the largest which the city
has met for many years, but while the loss has been this
has been covered by insurance so that the total loss has been but
$ The Firemen’s Pension Act, which has recently been
passed by such large vote, shows that the people appreciate the
fact that the firemen are believed to be fearless, faithful and courageous. Our Fire Department is certainly well managed, in good
condition and credit to our city.

BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.

The money appropriated for the different departments under
the Board of Public Works has been judiciously expended. Our )
streets have been kept in better condition than ever before.
Our public buildings have been well cared for. The days of usefulness of some of our bridges are fast drawing toaclose. The bridge
across the second level canal on Cabot street has been ordered
closed for the electric cars because of its unsafe condition. This
bridge, however, is not unsafe for ordinary travel if the cars of the
Street Railway Company are not allowed to run over it, though it
may be considered best to replace it this year with stone structure,
provided the Street Railway Company will consent to share a
portion of the expense. The appropriation for side-walks and
curbing should be increased so that the requests of the citizens
may be complied with.

BOARD OF HEALTH.

The work of the Board of Health seems to merit especial commendation, for we have been freed from contagious diseases, and,
under the strict diligence of the members of this Board, the death
rate of the city has been greatly reduced. The City Physician’s
report shows that he has carefully attended the cases which have
come before him. The report of the Inspector of Milk, Vinegar |
and Petroleum is worthy of consideration. The recommendation
that it be under the control of the Board of Health is excellent.

:
- MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
oo PARKS.
, The Park Commissioners have been faithful and diligent in
the performance of their duties and have improved our parks with
the appropriation at their command. new park system has been
mapped out for Elmwood Park, which in few years should bring
about beautiful park in that region. )
Oo |
- WATER DEPARTMENT. |
The Water Department is good financial investment for the |
city. The Commissioners have faithfully attended to their duties,
and though this department has been attacked during the year, I
believe the public have the utmost confidence in its management. |
With the payment of the bonds due next July the expense of all of |
the old system will have been paid off, and the supply from our
new system during the past dry season showed that the work has
been carefully planned and that our water supply is one of our most
valuable assets. We should not dispose of any of our surplus water
until it has been fully demonstrated to the public beyond all
question that we have more water than we can possibly use. The
prices might be rearranged in some particulars, especially relating
to elevators. This could be done by measuring the water once in
three months, instead of once month as now.
CITY ENGINEER’S DEPARTMENT.
During this year the department of the City Engineer and the
Engineer for the Water Department have been combined, and the
working force of this department has been reduced by one man for
the sake of greater economy. The report of the City Engineer
treats fully in regard to the excellent work done in his department.
The recommendations which he makes are worthy of careful consideration. —.. ,
. OVERSEERS OF THE POOR.
The report of the Overseers of the Poor shows an increase in
expenditure over the amount of the preceding year. This is caused

MAYOR’S ADDRESS.  
by the fact that this administration has paid one of last year’s large
bills for the insane in the State Asylum. This is not the only
department which has been compelled to pay this past year bills
which should have been paid during the preceding administration. |
The members of the Board have faithfully performed their duties.
The City Almoner has been careful and zealous in the difficult work
which he has had to perform. The City Farm has taken good
care of those who desire its assistance. How to decrease the
expenditures in this department is one of the most difficult problems which the city has to solve. Nearly one-tenth of cur entire
tax levy is expended by this department. It should be our aim to
find work for as many of our citizens as possible who are willing
and eager to earn their living so that they may be self-supporting
and self-respecting.

LEGAL DEPARTMENT.

The report of the City Solicitor shows that he has performed .
the duties of this department in highly creditable manner, and
deserves commendation for his work. For the first time in the
history of the city this department has been conducted with
financial profit to the city. The City Solicitor has turned into the
city treasury nearly The hearing of the petition of the
Lyman Mills for an abatement of their taxes has been closed, and
it only remains for the arguments to be made before decision is
given in this case. believe that in the future we could submit
such questions in dispute to arbitration to be decided by competent
persons rather than in expending such enormous sums for experts
and expenses from which no profit is derived by the city. This
case has cost us over and in my opinion it is poor policy
to expend any such sum in litigation when our wants for our
schools, streets and sewers are so pressing. One expert in this
case has sent in bill for over .

MUNICIPAL LIGHTING CASE.

In my opinion this city can never afford to operate the gas

and electric lighting plants which are under contemplation. The

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
plants are not up to date, and the city is getting second-class
article and will require large expenditure after they are secured to
make them modern plants. When this question was submitted to
the people for their consideration, the committee appointed by the
Board of Aldermen to investigate the matter reported that the
installation of the municipal lighting plant would cost and
the saving to the city would be per cent per year on the expenditures. The sum which the city will be compelled to pay will be far
in excess of any amount dreamed of at the time when this vote Was
passed, and the expenditure to the city of running the plants when
secured will be far in excess of the amount which we are now compelled to pay for our lighting. Under the law as it now stands the
city must receive its lighting at cost, and all losses in running the
plants must be borne by the mercantile part. This will load down
our merchants and private consumers—for most of our manufacturers
own and operate their own lighting plants—with loss which
experience has shown almost universally results from the operation
of municipal lighting plants by politicians. The fact that our Water |
Department has been well managed does not prove that gas and |
electric plants can be run by politicians who are totally ignorant of |
the art of producing gas and electricity. There was an effort made |
during the past year to make satisfactory arrangements with the |
Water Power Company and then ask permission from the Legis- :
lature to enter into satisfactory contract or have it referred to the —
; |
people for their consideration. It was not possible, however, to
reach terms which were entirely satisfactory to both parties. |
Several conferences were held and proposition submitted by the Water Power Company, for furnishing gas and electricity, for !
period of years. This proposition was not accepted, however, but
a counter proposition was submitted to the Company by the Board
| of Aldermen. This was declined by the Company. The expense
of this case will be large, for the cost has been nearly .
already, and the Water Power Company has not yet finished its evidence before the Commissioners. Probably the total legal and
court expenses to the city will reach before the case is
finished. Under the law as it stands the city is at disadvantage,
for it is not only required to take the plants of the Holyoke Water
Power Company, and cannot build its own plant as any private cor|

MAYOR’S ADDRESS.  
poration can, but the law requires us to pay the value of the plants,
when the vote was passed in December,  though we cannot
take possession until the final award has been made, which may be
two or three years, possibly more, from the present time, as the case
seems likely to go to the United States Supreme Court. Meanwhile
the Water Power Company are getting the benefit of the plants.
How much the electric machinery will be worth after it has been
run, perhaps five years, by the Holyoke Water Power. Company,
without any renewals or improvements, is matter of some question,
though we shall be compelled to purchase it at its value, when the
people voted to engage in municipal lighting. This matter should
require the careful] consideration of your honorable board as whether
or not the people should be allowed to again express their opinion
on this question, if the Holyoke Water Power Company make satisfactory concessions for it might seem to our citizens desirable to
wait until the law, which is new one, might have some of its imperfections corrected, before we should undertake municipal ownership, and when we might be allowed to build an entirely new
plant. should certainly prefer to see our streets improved and
the extra amount which this litigation would cost go to the laborers
rather than the lawyers. believe that this case is being conducted
with as little expense as such case can be conducted. It must
necessarily be very expensive and very lengthy. :

CASE VS. BONDSMEN.

On account of the uncertainty and expense connected with the
case brought against the sureties on the bonds of our alleged
defaulting ex-tax collector, it seems best after consultation with
a large number of the tax payers of our city to recommend that a
settlement of these cases be made. The Board of Aldermen voted
to accept the offer which was made by the bondsmen. The money
was paid over, and the larger part of it has been turned into the Sinking Fund. believe that the wisdom of this course is now acknow]ledged by the larger majority of our people.

  MAYOR'S ADDRESS. |

CASE VS. NEW ENGLAND TELEPHONE COMPANY.

In there was an ordinance passed by the Board of Aldermen requiring the Telephone Company to agree to certain conditions before any extensions should be granted. This the Company
refused to do, so the Board of Aldermen ordered the payments stopped for the use of telephones by the city. The Company brought
suit against the city for the amount due, and the suit is still pending
in the Superior Courtin Boston. The City Solicitor informs me that.
there is no defense to this action for the payment of the money. The
Company claims that they cannot afford to enter into any contract
with the city as contemplated. If they should do it in Holyoke they
would be compelled to do it in every city and town in which they are
located and this would be ruinous to their business. As the law stands
now the city of Holyoke receives no compensation from the Telephone
Company for the use of the streets. The Telephone Company pays
a large tax to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and this tax is
allowed to the cities in proportion to the amount of stock owned in
such city. Would it not be better if the tax were allowed to the
cities in proportion to the number of instruments located in such
city, thus the Telephone Company -would pay fair amount to the
city for the use of tne streets which is not paid under the present
law. The Board of Aldermen should petition the Legislature however for change of the law instead of endeavoring to compel by
ordinance what it is not feasible to accomplish in such manner.

IN CONCLUSION.

It has been the policy of the administration during the past
year to solve some of the problems which were confronting our
city. Our municipal affairs were in bad shape. Many of the
problems have been solved, we trust, for the best interests of the
city. Our needs for the coming year are many. Three sections of
our city are in pressing need of school houses. We are paying rent
enough for rooms in these various localities which would more than
pay the interest on the money needed for the buildings in these
sections. We need sewer for the Highlands section. Our streets
in South Holyoke need attention, and new bridge will be required.

, MAYOR’S ADDRESS.  
In order to meet our wants it will be necessary, therefore, for us to
borrow money. We will not be compelled, however, to pay as
large rate for interest as we have paid on those bonds which

* matured last year, nor to exd our debt limit. We have borrowed
. no money for current expense during the past year, but have raised
by taxation the amount which we have expended. believe the
same policy should be pursued during the coming year, and hope
the tax rate will be lower this year than last. Unless the Mayor
and Aldermen co-operate for the best interests of our city the
citizens will not receive the best results. We should consider all
questions carefully from business standpoint and decide matters
solely upon their merits. i

FREDERICK S. FULLER,
Public Accountant.

During the passage of this year the work of making our water
service especially helpful to the Fire Department has been continued. |

Under the supervision of the Superintendent of Water Works,
the Chairman of the Fire Commission and the Chief of the Fire
Department, hydrants, with latest improvements, were located
in the most needed districts and at the most serviceable points.
Adding these to the ones already located, we have total number
of hydrants throughout the city this number now gives us one
hydrant per every feet of main pipe.

There was also laid feet of main pipe, and more would
have been put under ground were it not that the cost of cast-iron
pipe was so enormously high. Wherefore we were obliged to defer,
to some later time, further enlargement of our distributing system. 

The usual care and vigilance were bestowed upon the reservoirs. Close by the Ashley Pond we built large barn in place of

the one destroyed by fire last year, and the two old barns were
treated to coat of paint. |

The Whiting Street reservoir was cleansed and purified and
most carefully guarded during the fishing season. Its banks were
made rid of stubs and roots of trees, and thus its whole appearance
is one of healthfulness and beauty.

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.

It is now our intention to prosecute with dispatch and economy
the high-service reservoirs mentioned in our last annual report.
Much of the preliminary work has already been done. The timber
and brush growing upon the bottom and sides of the proposed basin
have been removed, and the low dike, which we propose to build
out of the material gathered from the interior of the reservoir,
shows itself under construction. large part of the loam, top soil,
etc., to be necessarily taken from this basin will be used in the
building of the dike, and thus the water, when stored therein, will

- be free from all unsavory taste and odor. This high-service pressure
will be of great benefit to the people in the higher sections of the
city. We hope to bring it to prosperous and speedy completion
without increasing our debt. It is safe on our part to presume
that we can pay therefor out of the ordinary receipts of the
Department.

During the coming year our bonded debt will be reduced by
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, which will be
cancelled when it comes up for payment July rst. The balance of
our bonded debt will then be which can be taken care
of when it falls due in  ;

With great pleasure, indeed, do we call your attention to the
abundance and purity of the water supplied to the city. Magnificent and beneficent results have come to the people since we added
to our supplying sources the Manhanriver. During the past, and
yet slowly passing, dry season—the longest and driest on record for
this part of the country—they have in truth been manifest. While
other cities and towns have continually been in state of fear as to
the consequences of this drought, while they have been going to.

, very great expense to avoid serious calamity and to obtain very
meagre supply of tainted and unwholesome water, we have been
having, and have yet, an inexhaustible supply of pure and wholesome water. |

It is pleasant announcement also to make to you that
settlement has been made with most of those whose land and water
privileges have suffered to any extent by the pipe line from the
Fomer reservoir to the city. In all these cases we have procured a
right of way of feet, so that in the future, if there be necessity,

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
we will be able to lay another line of pipe aside of the present one
without extra cost to the Department for land damages.

There are, however, some few cases in which we have not yet:
reached asettlement. These we hope to have reasonably adjusted
before late day. Three of these cases are now pending investigation and settlement before the joint boards of County Commissioners of Hampden and Hampshire counties.

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.
OFFICE OF FIRE COMMISSION,
December .
To the Honorable Mayor and City Council:
GENTLEMEN.—In accordance with the requirements of the City
Ordinance, your Board of Fire Commissioners present their report
for the year ending December .
The Board organized January by the election of Charles
L. Newcomb as chairman, M. J. Laporte as vice-chairman and John
Hildreth as secretary.
| In May Commissioner M. J. Laporte resigned as member of

the Fire Commission and Daniel Proulx was appointed to fill the
vacancy. Commissioner Buck was elected vice-chairman to sucd

M. J. Laporte. Your Commissioners have held twenty-two )

formal meetings during the past year. This has been year of serious fires. Never in the history of the department have greater

demands been made upon it than during the past year, and never

has it responded more nobly. ,

The most serious among the many large fires were the F. F.
O’Neill block June  about J. A. Peltier block February
 loss over Connor Bros. mill February  loss  ;
German Lutheran church February  loss  Windsor Hotel
block February  loss P. Garvins’ stock house, etc.,
May  loss C.A.Corser’s block February  loss  ;

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.
Whiting Street block July  loss Chemical Paper Company September  loss .

The losses for the month of February were exceptionally heavy,
amounting to over and it was on the last day of this
month that we had the most disastrous fire, the Windsor fire. This
fire was promptly attacked, and for nearly two hours it seemed as
though we should sucd in keeping it in the basement where it
commenced, but the construction of the building was such that it
was impossible to prevent it running up the partitions and it broke
through the partitions on the fourth floor and in few minutes this
magnificent building was huge furnace, and the inmates escaped
with difficulty notwithstanding the most heroic efforts the fire continued to spread, and the Commissioners, who were all there, deter| mined to send for help to Springfield and they responded promptly
giving us very valuable help, which we gratefully acknowledge, as
well as the help we received from South Hadley. .

When the fire got fairly hold of the Windsor block the department devoted itself mainly to the work of saving the adjoining building and the opera house, but before the fire was controlled the fine
block of stores connected with the hotel was consumed, but the
opera house was saved with little loss, although it caught fire number of times.

Several of our firemen were severely injured at this fire by falling wire and stones. And take it all in all, it wasone of the worst —
fires we have had to contend with..

The Whiting Street block was another hard fire to handle, but
the fire was kept inside of this building by very good work.

There have been fires and alarms, and the total damage to
buildings and contents was Of this amount 
was paid by the insurance companies, leaving net loss to our citi} zens of only .

The very hard work of the men at some of the fires has resulted
in serious illness of number of the men, and these with the men
laid off from accidents, has resulted in quite an increase in the
amount required for salaries.

We again bear our tribute of praise to the chief, officers and
men of the department for the energy, skill and courage that they

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.  
have displayed in pursuing their arduous duties, and we believe it ,
would be difficult to find their equal. |
 We congratulate our citizens that while we have had such very
bad year, it has resulted in only net loss of which is
really very remarkable. |
 There has been added to our department during the past year
a splendid new American Fire Engine, and two engines have been
rebuilt, making practically three new engines purchased this last
year. These with the new apparatus, which we were obliged to purchase to replace that destroyed at the Windsor fire, entailed cost
of about ,oco, which is the amount our expenditures exd |
those of last year. And we have to thank our Honorable Mayor
and Board of Aldermen for your very generous treatment of the
 department in this its trying year.
We make the following recommendations and trust that they
will receive your careful consideration :
First—The need for new headquarters is greater than ever.
The constant presence of street cars in the vicinity of the present
engine house is source of great danger, and during the past year
accidents have been barely averted. Suitable locations are growing
scarcer.
Second—We again recommend the erection of an engine house
 near the new High School and the placing of first-class chemical
at that point. The city and citizens have very valuable property
in this district, and it is considerable distance from any engine
house and when we consider that almost every family in the city
has some member of its family in the High School, and great proportion of them are girls, it does seem as though it would be wise to
have some permanent men nearer than they are now. We want to
draw attention, in this connection, to the fact that about seventyfive per cent of our fires are extinguished by chemicals proving
the value of this method of fire fighting.
Third We recommend that combination ladder and chemical
be placed at the Highlands engine house, as we believe that an
apparatus equipped with light extension ladders and first-class
chemical engine would be very valuable piece of apparatus for
this rapidly growing district and we also recommend that separate stable be finished off for use as hospital where sick and lame

| REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.
horses can be properly taken care of, and this can be done at no
great expense. We also request that apparatus used for drying
hose in this house be changed, as it is now dangerous.

‘Fourth—We recommend that the old High School bell be
placed in position at the Emerald Engine House, where it will be of
great service to the members of Hose Company No.  We trust
that this year this will receive your attention. We have recommended it for number of years, but without avail. It would not ,
cost much to do this, and it is sincerely hoped that this bell may be
put to use. :

Fifth—We recommend that the system of heating the various
engine houses be changed, and that the system designed by Charles
L. Newcomb, now in successful operation at Ward One engine
house, be adopted. We do not use more than one-quarter of the |
amount of fuel we did with the old system, and we ask your especial
attention to this recommendation on the ground of economy.

Sixth—We also recommend that the fire limits be extended.

: Seventh—We récommend the appointment of sufficient permanent men to man the apparatus at headquarters, as we believe at
this important center call men ought not to be employed. There
ought to be at least three permanent men put on this year, one
at Steamer No.  one at Hose No.  one at Hose No:  At these
points for six hours during the day there is only one man, as it is
necessary for the men to go to their meals three times day, thus
leaving only one man with the apparatus.  |

Eighth—We again recommend the putting of double windows
on several of the houses, especially in the Highlands and Elmwood
districts. ,

Ninth—We recommend the purchase of at least five thousand
( feet of new hose as soon as possible. |

Tenth—We recommend that stand pipes be erected at various |
points on the canal banks for the purpose of taking water therefrom.
This would add greatly to the effectiveness of our department.

Eleventh—We recommend that holes be cut, for engine suctions, in the footpaths of every bridge, to do away with the necessity
of drawing up the flooring, as we now have to, when we need to 
draw water from the canals.

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.  
MANUAL FORCE.

The permanent force has been increased during the past year
by the addition of two men, and this adds greatly to the efficiency of the department. The additions are as follows, viz. :

P. J. Kennedy, spare driver.

Sefroi Perron, in Steamer Company No.  .

And the permanent force now consists of the following: Chief,
Superintendent of Fire Alarm Telegraph, nine captains and three
lieutenants, two engineers of steamers, fourteen drivers and five
permanent men. The total force of the department is as follows,

APPARATUS.

, Most of the apparatus is in good condition, but after the very
hard season we have just passed through some of it will have to be
repaired.

We have purchased second-size American fire engine from
the American Fire Engine Company, and had the same company
rebuild Engine No. and Engine No.  so that we have practically
added three engines to our department.

We have also repaired Hook and Ladder No. and added
some modern extension ladders to it, so that it is nowa very effective piece of apparatus.

The apparatus now in active service consists of six steam fire
engines, one double-tank chemical engine, one combination hose
and chemical wagon, seven two-horse hose wagons, one aerial truck,

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.
two hook and ladder trucks, five exercise and supply wagons, one
chief's buggy, one superintendent of fire alarm wagon and three
sleighs.
HORSES.  
We have thirty-two horses in the department, and they
are in excellent condition, but the very hard use that fire department horses have make their life in the service very short. Sickness, accidents and death are something we cannot provide against
with the best of care we give them. We have purchased during the
year four horses. Two of them were exchanged for other
horses and two were bought.
| HOSE.
We have purchased feet of new hose during the year, and
it was needed very much. We shall need to purchase considerable
more this year, as we have had to reject large amount of old hose
which has been in the department for long time and which leaves
us with only the following :

, HOUSES.

The various engine houses are in very good condition, but the.
floor on the bed-room at the Highland Engine House should be
replaced with new hardwood floor, as it is dangerous now. The
tower also of Engine House No. should be fixed, as also the tower
at the Highlands should have new hoisting apparatus for the hose.
We thank the Board of Public Works for their many acts of courtesy
and trust that they may be able to make the above repairs.

FIRE ALARM TELEGRAPH.

We call the attention of our citizens to this branch of our service. We have made great many improvements under the superintendency of Mr. Castle. There has never been greater demand
on this branch of our service than during this past year and we certainly have never had better results, the credit of which must be
given to the very careful management of Superintendent Castle. We
have changed completely the location of the headquarters and battery room and have sub-divided the lines so that now we have
very much shorter circuits. This was done ata great expense, but
it gives us great deal more efficient service. The old quarters of
the fire alarm department were needed as sleeping room for the
members of Hook and Ladder No.  so that we were obliged to
make the above changes on this account. We have put in six strong

- current protectors which were needed very much. We still recom  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.
mend that all the fire alarm boxes be equipped with the Standard
Cut-outs, which are necessity on account of strong power currents
and the many electric light wires which cross our lines. There are
fifty boxes that still remain to be fitted with the Standard Cutout, and while this will entail an expense of about  it is imperatively necessary and should be done, as leaving them in their present
condition is constant menace to the safety of the city. During
the past year we have put in two new boxes, and they are located as
follows :
Box  National Blank Book Company.
Box  on Bigelow street.
We have put in two miles of new wire and three mechanical
gongs.

REPORT OF THE
SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
To his Honor, the Mayor, and the Citizens of Holyoke:

The School Committee respectfully submit their annual report
for the year eighteen hundred and ninety-nine.

This year has been most important one for the School Department. We have had many questions of moment come before us
which have called for considerable attention on our part.

During the present year there have occurred many changes in
our School Department. The first and most important one was
caused by the necessity of electing new Superintendent of Schools.
To the problem of filling the vacancy the committee, early in the
year, turned their attention. After considerable thought and care
the School Committee unanimously elected Mr. Louis P. Nash of
Gardner, Mass., to the position of Superintendent of Schools. He
is man of wide and ripe experience, having been Superintendent
of Schools at Hingham and Gardner for many years. We believe
that Holyoke is fortunate in securing so efficient and pains-taking
a man, and we look to continued advance of our educational interests under his Jeadership.

We were also called upon to fill the position of Principal of the
High School, caused by the much regretted and unexpected resignation of Mr. Charles H. Keyes. Early in September Mr. Winfred
C. Akers of Somerville, Mass., was elected Principal of the High
School. Mr. Akers is teacher of considerable experience and one
well qualified to carry on the work of our High School. The suc  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
cess which has marked his short service is sufficient indication of
the wisdom of this appointment.

The condition of our schools during the past year has been
highly satisfactory. ‘lhe teaching force have labored faithful'y and
diligently, manifesting an earnest appreciation of their responsibility.

We earnestly hope that the appropriation asked by this Department for the year nineteen hundred will not be decreased, as the
cost of this Department increases from year to year.

/ We hope that this year will see the erection of Highland
school. We are sorely in need of the school and pray that there may
be no more delay. The School Committee have done their full duty
in this matter. The questions which we were called upon to decide
were the selection of site and plans for building; this we have
done, and all that remains is for the City Government to appropriate
the necessary money.

At the present time we are expending large sum of money
for rent of tenements and stores which are used as school-rooms ;
ill-heated, ill-ventilated, and poorly lighted rooms, menace to the
health and vitality of the pupils, and the money spent in this way is
almost enough to pay the interest on the cost of modern school
building.

We wish also to call your attention to the fact that additional
school room is needed in Springdale and Elmwood.

The expenditures of the year have been carefully guarded, and
we have the distinction of having been able to live within our
appropriation and leaving balance on the right side of the ledger
after the year’s work was completed.

For more detailed account of the School Department we
respectfully refer you to the reports of the Superintendent of Schools
and the various sub-committees, as they contain much information
and many valuable suggestions pertaining to school affairs.

Respectfully submitted,
THOMAS J. LYNCH,
THOMAS J. CARMODY,
EDWARD N. WHITE,
Committee on Annual Report.

REPORT OF THE
— First District Commiltee.

The buildings in this district are in fairly good condition.
Some minor repairs are needed, as gutters and curtains at East
Dwight street, change in the doors at Bridge street, and other
small matters

We believe that all inside blinds should be removed and suitable curtains furnished. The inside blinds are difficult to keep clean,
and in certain conditions as to light, they may be the means of
serious injury to the eyes of pupils. We need new furniture for the
assembly hall at West street. The ventilation of the sanitary rooms .
at this building is faulty, and this ought to be remedied at once.
More room is needed at North Chestnut street, and water supply
should be provided on the different floors, so that pupils need not
go to the basement for drink of water. [Lt is unfortunate that the
little building at West Holyoke should be left without water sup| ply. An attempt was made to get water by driving pipe. This
failed, and nothing has been done. It would seem, however, that
a well might be provided at small cost.

The number of pupils at the North Chestnut street building

continues to increase. An assistant has been placed in one room,

* and if there is much further increase it may become necessary to so
change the district lines as to send some pupils to Elm street or
Appleton street.

The most important thing, however, that this committee has to
recommend is that immediate steps be taken to improve the sanitaries at the East Dwight street building. The sanitary accommodations are altogether insufficient for the number of pupils, and the  
circumstances are such that good accommodations can be provided without great expense.

Respectfully submitted,
THOMAS J. CARMODY,
| THOMAS J. LYNCH,
JOSEPH B. WALSH.

REPORT OF THE .
Second District Committee.
|
' ‘This district includes the schools at Appleton street, South
Chestnut street, Elm street, Back street, and South street or Elm- |
wood. At the beginning of the present school year new rooms
were opened at Elm street, South Chestnut street and South street. |
We have now membership of pupils, with teachers. |
During the year the Back street school-house has been thor- |
oughly renovated. Some minor repairs have been made at other
buildings, and new furniture has been provided for several rooms
at Elm street, South Chestnut street, Appleton street and Elmwood.
The new furniture is boon to these schools. Formerly there were
a considerable number of pupils who were compelled to use desks
and chairs that were altogether unsuitable in size. This evil is now
remedied. At Appleton street the nuisance of standing water in
the air-shafts has been entirely done away. In several rooms of
this district new blackboards have been furnished or old ones
re-slated.
) We desire to acknowledge the cordial and efficient co-operation of the Board of Public Works, who have done much for the
schools and school-houses, although their means were limited. |
For next year we have to recommend the following improvements as imperatively demanded :
First—At Appleton street, new windows, additional sanitary
accommodations and the removal of the electric motor to the basement.
Second—At South Chestnut street, new and larger sanitary
accommodations. The present sanitaries are limited, and they are
a menace to the health of teachers and pupils. This building needs |

THIRD DISTRICT COMMITTEE.  
also, some minor repairs, an electric gong, etc. These will cost but
little. The new sanitaries, however, will cost considerable sum,
and they ought not to be neglected for single day.

Third—For the Elmwood district we recommend the immediate erection of new building on the same lot as the present
building. The city now pays  year as rent for three rooms:
This sum would more than meet the interest on the cost of building which would give us twice that number of rooms. Besides that,
these rented rooms can never be altogether satisfactory. They were
not built for school-rooms, and they cannot be so used without
inconvenience and loss. The Elmwood district is growing rapidly, |
ad will, without doubt, continue to grow. By the time new building can be finished, almost all of it will be demanded for immediate 
occupancy, leaving none too much room for future growth.

Respectfully submitted,
| ODILON Z. E. CHAREST,
EDWARD N. WHITE,
| GEORGE P. ELLISON.
| REPORT OF THE
Third District Committee.

During the past year the buildings of the Third District have
not called for any great amount of repairs. The furniture at Park
street and Sargeant street has been varnished, and some new furniture has been provided, where it was most needed. We would call
attention to the crowded condition of several buildings in this
district.

At Sargeant street, all the rooms are full, and in one firstgrade room there are sixty-four little children, with two teachers.

At Hamilton street, we have been obliged to place class of

  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
about forty children in the hall, where the light is poor and the
prospect of heating satisfactorily in severe weather is very doubtful.
At Ingleside, we have fifty-one pupils ina room that is just.
about sufficient for thirty. |
At Springdale we have accommodation for only the primary
classes all pupils of higher grades are obliged to walk long dis, tance, to Sargeant street or Hamilton street. One of these primary
classes is placed in the hose house the other two classes are in the
school-house. This building is unsatisfactory in many ways, and
the sanitary accommodations are utterly unfit for modern schoolhouse. The school population of this district is increasing rapidly,
| and we feel that there is urgent need of better accommodations.
The situation at Nonotuck street is the most serious of all.
Here we have one hundred and fifty children on the third floor, at
the top of two long flights, with practically only one stair case. Into
the cellar there are crowded eight furnaces, besides the electric
motors which drive the ventilating fan. more dangerous state
| of affairs it would be difficult to imagine. In hired rooms outside.
we have one hundred and eighty-four pupils, these being the smaller |
children. It needs no argument to show that these rooms are not
and cannot be suitable or economical.
We hope that active measures will be taken at once to provide }
a new building for the Highlands, and one at Springdale.
There are several children who live in the extreme northern
part of the city, near the Northampton line. The distance that
these children have to go, to the Nonotuck street building, is excessive. We believe that the time has come when some aid should be
given, so that these children may attend school regularly. We rec- ,
ommend that fares be paid, once day each way, for these children.
And since the number of children at Ingleside is too large for
one teacher, we recommend that fares be paid for pupils of the
upper grades at Ingleside that they may go to the West street
school. }
The members of this committee desire to place on record their .
appreciation of the character and services of Mr. Wilbur F. Nichols, ,

COMMITTEE ON PRINTING AND SUPPLIES.  
and of the loss which the city sustains in his departure. For seventeen years, Mr. Nichols has labored with entire faithfulness, with
great ability, and with conspicuous success, to develop the highest
possible good in the lives of the children who have been committed
to his care and instruction by the city of Holyoke. His work will
not be forgotten.

Respectfully submitted,

AUGUSTINE W. ESLEECK.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON
PRINTING AND SUPPLIES.
Gentlemen of the School Committee:

We herewith submit’ to you our report of the appropriations
and expenditures for text books, educational supplies, building
supplies, printing and advertising, during the year  .

We would request the careful consideration of the Committee
to the expenditures allotted to this department during the year and
that of the previous year. You will find that it has cost considerably less to operate this department, notwithstanding the increased
number of pupils. |

We fully appreciate the business like methods introduced by
our efficient Superintendent Mr. Louis P. Nash, and the work contributed by him is plainly shown in the figures of this report.

We have now very convenient quarters for the storing of supplies in the basement of the old High School. It is well lighted by
large windows, and the ventilation is good, and the capacity is
much larger than that of the old quarters in the city hall basement.

  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

We desire to express our thanks to the principals of the various |
buildings, and also the supervisors of drawing and writing, music .
and calisthenics, for their earnest work of economy pertaining to |

, this department. a

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON
MANUAL TRAINING AND
KINDERGARTENS.

This city has now five kindergartens, viz.: East Dwight street»
Hamilton street, North Chestnut street, Elm street and South street.
There are ten teachers, with total enrolment of children. In
all these rooms the work is good, and it will be of the very highest
value to those who are privileged to attend. Some people are unwilling to send their children to the kindergarten, because they feel
that there is not enough work done there but it is true that the lessons of the kindergarten are preparation for the best citizenship of
the future. We wish that the mothers of the children would visit the
kindergartens and see what is being done in them. They would
certainly come away with high opinion of this work. Just assoon 
as the rooms can be provided we shall urge the Committee that a
kindergarten be opened in every school district.

As regards manual training, an excellent beginning has been

  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE. ,
made in the High School, with woodwork, mechanical drawing,
sewing, dressmaking and cooking. The course in mechanical drawing should be largely increased, while bent iron work, chipping, ,;
filing and forging should be introduced. Some work in manual ;
training has been done in lower grades by voluntary action of the !
teachers. This includes knife-work, little carpentry and sewing. :
It is recommended that this work be extended and regular supervisor be engaged.

SCHOOL BUILDINGS.

Attention will be first called to the school buildings. We have
in all nineteen buildings, most of them in fairly good condition, and
some excellent. But these buildings are insufficient for the accommodation of the children. The crying need, in this rapidly growing
city, is for more school-houses. It would seem that mere recital
of the state of affairs ought to arouse all the people of the city to
action. The reports of the sub-committees of the Second and
Third Districts show plainly how great isthe need. Ourchildren are
driven into attic-rooms in some places, with poor light and poor |
ventilation. They are put out into hired tenement rooms, in many
respects unsuitable. Sanitary accommodations are inadequate, and
in several cases they are so faulty as to be constant and terrible
menace to the health of teachers and pupils.

The great interest of all our lives, the one which overshadows
all other interests combined, is the question of the future welfare of

  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
' our children and in that future welfare good health is the first consideration. New buildings should be at once provided on the Highlands,
at Elmwood and at Springdale. It is good deal to ask for three
buildings at once, know; but this is work that should have been
begun two or three years ago. Further postponement will only
make matters worse. The present policy of hiring rooms is bad
educationally, and it is in the highest degree expensive and extravagant. There ought to be no hesitation, and trust there will be
none, in providing additional school bujldings, and some at least
of the needed improvements in our present buildings. —

TEACHERS. |

‘“‘As is the teacher, so is the school.’’ You may have the finest
buildings, the most expensive equipment, the most elaborate plans
and courses of study all these will fail of their purpose unless in
the school-room, in daily contact with the lives of the children, you
have wise, high-minded, large-hearted, efficient teacher.

It is the most important duty of the Superintendent to secure
such teachers for his schools, and then, by counsel, by encouragement, by loyal support and sympathy, he should maintain an environment that will inspire the teachers to do the best work that is
possible in their schools.

Under the rules of the Holyoke School Committee it is the
duty of the Superintendent to nominate all teachers, and he should
exercise great care, wise discretion and high aim in making his

- selection. His sole object should be to secure the best teachers.
Friendship, or neighborhood, or personal consideration of any sort
whatever should have no weight. The good of the children is the
only thing to be considered. Candidates whose homes are in the
city should be first considered. There is no danger that this argument will be forgotten or neglected.

In general it should be said that we have an excellent corps of
principals and teachers. They have earned the confidence of the
people. They are loyal to their work and to one another; they
show spirit of growth in their professional duties, and they are
doing good work. |

fact that the little children come to schoo! at almost any time during the year. shall recommend that beginners be admitted at

only two times,—that is at the beginning of the fall term, and at the 

beginning of the spring term.

MANUAL TRAINING. |
I would call the attention of the School Committee especially

. to the subject of manual training. The educational laws of our

State prescribe certain subjects that must be taught in all schools,

and one of these subjects is manual training. Section of Chapter

  of the Acts of says —

Every town and city of twenty thousand or more inhabitants shall
maintain as part of both its elementary and its High School system
the teaching of manual training.

This law is at present only partially complied with in our city.

We have successful course in manual training at the High
School; this should be enlarged by introducing some metal work,
and by increasing the amount of mechanical drawing.

In our elementary schools, few devoted teachers have introduced manual training by their own motion, cheerfully adding this
labor to that which they had before. Some good work is being
done, but this does not meet the requirements of the law. We
should have supervisor of manual training, who should organize
the work into definite system. We ought not to move too fast in
this matter, but make trial with the two upper grammar grades,
and the system should be extended only so far as the committee
find it to be really valuable.

Manual training is to be considered in two ways; first for its
educative power, secondly for its economic value. There is danger that pupils will deal exclusively with books and words with the
mere forms of knowledge. Pupils need to learn to use their hands,
to carry into effect their ideas. ‘The mind that is so trained gets a
kind of power that cannot be gained from book-study alone. On
its economic side, manual training is equally significant and valuable. By such instruction as we can give with reasonable economy
at school, we can fit the girls of our city to be more efficient as the
future house-mothers. We can so train the boys that they will be

SUPERINTENDENT AND SECRETARY.  
able to do better work, to take better places, to earn more money,
than would be possible without this training.

Educated workmen are in demand; not those who may have
loaded down their memories with mass of information collected
from books, but those who have trained themselves to think clearly,
to understand their work, to act with energy and success. There
can be no question but that for the development of such men, manual training ought to contribute more than any other single school
study. 

In the discussion of this question we should note the great
change in social conditions that has taken place. Years ago,
boys and girls received an excellent.practical education at home.

 But the admirable lessons that were learned on the farm, or in the
little shops where man took in his boys to help him, are all taken
away from our city children now, and something must be found to
take their place.

‘There is fear in the minds of many excellent persons, that the
schools and systems of educations are likely to be developed too
far, out of proportion to the general life of the community. The
fear is often expressed that so much schooling unfits young people
for work and for success in life; people look back with regret to
the simpler ways of years ago, they feel that the methods of the

| present day are not so good, and further development along the
same lines is discouraged. It should be remembered that it is easy
to find fault with the present, while it is very natural to look back to
the days of our youth, and think that they were far better. What
we need is not general impression, but definite evidence. And the
evidence is that where schools have been most highly developed
according to modern ideas, there the young people, instead of being
unfitted, are most highly fitted for success in life.

The statistics of education show that Massachusetts leads the
country in the amount of education which its children receive.
Each child in Massachusetts receives on an average seven years of
schooling throughout the United States, an average of four years.
The average earning capacity for the whole population of Massachusetts is cents, and for the country as whole it is  cents.
It is surprising that the figures are so nearly alike. Schooling is in
the ratio of to  o. Earning capacity in the ratio of to  o.

, \
  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL comMITTEn.
The most recent figures, by Mr. Horace G. Wadlin, give ratio of |
  to  Or cents more per capita in Massachusetts.

Now here is some definite, positive proof of what the schools |
are doing for the people, and submit that in the face of such figures /
it can only be held that the modern ideas in education are of the '
highest value in preparing the youth of the land for success in life. |
It appears that as money-making investment, the cost of schools  
pays better than aay other investment that has yet been found.  

Hon. Frank A. Hill, Secretary of the State Board of Education, .

has commented on these statistics as follows |

Consider fora moment what is involved in the showing that each ,
person in Massachusetts has daily wealth-producing power cents
in excess of the average for the nation at large. It means that for
each person the average annual excess is It means that for all
the people of the State the annual excess is That is to .
say, the productive energy of Massachusetts yields nearly 
a year more than it would yield if the per capita productive capacity
of the State were no greater than the average throughout the country.
This is twenty times the annual running expenses of the public V

| schools. It is not necessary to attribute to the schools this vast ex-  
cess of production above the average for the country to prove that
they pay enormous material dividends. If so humble fraction as a
fifth or even tenth part of this excess, or of an aggregate much less |
than this excess of can be traced to the schools, they are
yet securities that each year return to the State much more than their
annual cost.

THE HIGH SCHOOL.

Our high school is.in flourishing condition. There is in |
general an earnest spirit of study and improvement on the part of ,
the student body, and vigorous, healthful life pervades all departments. very rapid growth may be looked for, especially along .
the lines of manual and technical training, science and art. The ,
resources of the Board will be severely taxed to supply adequate ,
means for this growth. Fora presentation in detail of the condition and prospects of the school, reference should be made to the .
excellent report of the principal, which is found in the Appendix.

: SUPERINTENDENT AND SECRETARY.  
EVENING SCHOOLS.

 These constitute an important part of the schoolsystem. With a
total enrolment last year of pupils, and total cost of ,
it will be seen at once that this work must have an important
bearing upon the future of our city. In the elementary evening
schools there are large numbers of pupils who are learning how to
read and write the English language. Thisis in the interest of good
citizenship. In the evening grammar schoo] are those who are |
ambitious to carry forward an education which has been interrupted,
perhaps by the necessity of going to work. In several departments
of this school we are now doing practically high school work. It
appears to me that the time has come for organizing regular evening high school at the high school building, where advanced
work in science, languages, mathematics or other studies may be
given to those who desire it. |

, The general tone of orderly conduct and studious effort in our
evening schools is admirable. would cordially invite any persons who care to give some attention to questions of public education and of the public welfare to visit our evening schools, see the
pupils, talk with the teachers, and learn what is going on there.
They cannot fail to be profoundly interested in this important work
and in the progress which is being made.

KINDERGARTENS.

The work in our kindergartens is good, and will prove to be of
inestimable value to those who are privileged to attend. The kindergarten does not aim to teach stated facts from books it aims
rather to open the minds and hearts of the children to all good
influences it aims to put the child into right relations with other
children and with all the world about him. Children learn at the
kindergarten to love music, they learn to play games that teach
the lesson of mutual helpfulness, they learn to have sympathy with
animals and trees and flowers, they learn to see something interesting in almost all the natural objects that surround them. They
also learn to use their senses accurately, to use their voices in

sph and song, to use their hands in wonderful variety of childish tasks. While moving in order about their work and their play,

  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
they practice self-restraint and learn how to act in harmony with
one another for the common good. All these lessons are of the very
highest importance. It is in the kindergarten, perhaps more than
anywhere else in the school system, that we are developing the
qualities that will make most useful citizens. The spirit of love
toward one another, of sunshine and happiness, is the pervading
spirit of the kindergarten, and there can be no question of its
wholesome and beneficent influence.
If the mothers of little children could visit the kindergartens
more and learn what they are doing, great good would result.
Children should enter the kindergarten at four years of age and
 pass into the first primary grade at five. We need several more
kindergartens, and as soon as the rooms can be provided shall
advise that new ones be opened. )
| IN GENERAL. |
There is one respect in which our schools have particularly
suffered from the crowding of the buildings. The number of pupils
to teacher has in several cases been increased beyond what is
| desirable. The rules of the School Committee state the number of
pupils that should be given to one teacher, but this number has
been exded, and fear that there will be many more such cases,
before new buildings become available. No one can fail to understand that when the teacher has to deal with an excessive number
of children, every child suffers loss. These precious years of
school life ought to be utilized to the utmost; the tendency is, in
progressive communities, to reduce the number of pupils in each
room. This of course necessitates more teachers and increased
expense. But it far more than repays the expense by increased
efficiency in the work done.
The relations of the public schools with the various private and
parochial schools have been altogether harmonious, and am glad
to acknowledge the marked courtesy that has been shown to myself
and those associated with me, by those in charge of these schools.
It is much to be desired that there should be definite understanding when pupils desire transfer from one system to the other.
Careless or unscrupulous parents will sometimes take advantage of

SUPERINTENDENT AND SECRETARY.  
such transfers to keep children out of school altogether and this
may in some cases continue for some time before it is discovered.

In some of our schools, division of the work has been made,

so that teacher will follow single line of work through several |
grades the work is organized partly on the departmental plan of
teaching. This appears to give increased efficiency to the work of
the teachers, since it enables each teacher to concentrate her effort
and preparation atong the line of her best abilities. It however
sacrifices to some extent the personal influence of the teacher over
her pupils, and it detracts from the unity of the school work as it
should appear to the child. Almost every plan of work has some
advantages, together with some defects it is the true wisdom to
weigh both sides, and not expect too-‘much. The so-called departmental plan of work in grammar schools has been great help, and
will so continue to be. But the practical difficulties are such that
the fundamental organization of the schools will probably continue
to be, as at present, by yearly grades, bringing in departmental
organization as far as may seem desirable in any building.

In conclusion, wish to acknowledge the courtesy and assistance which have received from the members of the Committee,
as also from all connected with the School Department, and from
many people besides. We stand at most interesting point in the .
history of the school system of Holyoke. The years of the immediate future will doubtless witness remarkable growth, as well in
the number of children as in the plans of work that will be required. .
To lift up and carry on this work to broader and higher success is
a task that will require entire devotion, with patient and strenuous
labor. It may well call forth the most earnest resolve and the best
effort of every individual to whom is committed any share of such
a responsibility.

Respectfully submitted,

REPORT OF THE ss
SUPERVISOR OF DRAWING.
Mr, Louis P. Nash, Superintendent of Schools, Holyoke, Mass.

Dear Sir: Drawing is still considered by some to be an
ornamental rather than practical study; pleasant occupation
for leisure hours—“ Well enough in its way, if you haven’t anything
better to do,” as some one remarked to me not long ago.

Now haven’t the slightest wish to belittle any other subject
taught in our schools. can quite appreciate the fact that most of
them are important and necessary, but do claim that, aside from
the three elementary R’s, there is no subject in the whole school
curriculum that offers more that will be of practical value to the
‘pupil in after life, even when the matter is considered from purely
utilitarian point of view, than does the subject of drawing or art
education.

It is undoubtedly true that drawing and the allied arts are
exciting greater interest than ever before in every part of the civilized
world, and this is not strange when we consider that there is hardly

a branch of manufacture that is entirely independent of the artist
and decorator. ‘The butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker,”’
all depend upon the attractiveness of their wares for increased sales,
and in these days of rivalry and competition the merchant or manufacturer who sucds best in attracting and pleasing the eye is the
one who sucds best in business. As one writer remarks, ‘“‘ Every
branch of industry has blossomed into its own industrial art.”

This demand for decoration and ornamvntation is inherent in
human nature it is an instinct implanted even in the savage mind,
and one that develops, not always wisely, with advancing civilization. The savage’s beads, gewgaws and tattooing have been supplanted by beautiful fabrics that delight the eye as well as add to
comfort, and not only in articles pertaining to dress, but in all those

SUPERVISOR OF DRAWING.  
associated with the home and its furnishings we expect to find an
expression of the degree of taste and culture to which its inmates
have attained. oe

Demand creates supply. Ifthe public taste demands artistic
products they will, somehow, be supplied. If America, as nation,
is to surround her people with things of beauty, things that make
life more attractive and better worth living, she must so educate
them that they will demand beauty, not as luxury, but as part of
their everyday lives and associated with all the common articles in
daily use. The same training that will develop taste and an appreciation of the beautiful, and so create demand for it from the
many, will also train the few having special artistic ability, so that
they will be able, in measure, to furnish things of beauty to those
who can appreciate such, but who are themselves unable to produce
them... .

An illustration of this, in small way, has been noticed in connection with the High School pupils’ work on their school paper.

It was thought sufficient, at first, if the paper possessed literary
merit, but lately there has been demand that it should be made

more attractive by means of decorative headings and an artistic ,
cover. The first attempts of the pupils in the art classes to supply

this demand were extremely crude, but recent issues of the paper 
have contained some very creditable designs.

It must be understood, however, that the highest degree of 
creative power can be the result only of ages of culture. England,
Germany and France are lavish of expenditure in furnishing means
of artistic training for their people, and largely, perhaps, from economic motives. They realize that the demand for skilled artistic
labor is constantly increasing and that with growing wealth and cult-.
ure higher standard of taste is constantly being developed that will
be satisfied only with the best and most artistic products that can be
obtained. If America fails to realize this also,—if her artistic artisans are unable to compete successfully with their foreign brothers,
other more art-loving countries, where the subject is receiving more
and more attention, will furnish the artistic skill demanded and
reap the reward, while American prosperity will suffer corresponding loss. :

I make this plea in behalf of drawing because fear that some

  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

are inclined to think that an undue amount of time is spent upon it
in our schools. If the only object sought in introducing art education into the schools were to train the pupils so that they should be
able to draw or paint pictures, should be quite willing to admit
that only small amount of time could profitably be spent upon it,
but the results aimed at are so much broader in scope and if
secured exert so wide-reaching an influence, that it seems only
necessary to have the facts in the case fully understood to rerder
every one interested in the matter unwilling to have any less tirne
devoted to this subject than has been allotted to it in the past.

The work in drawing has been carried on quite satisfactorily
throughout the city during the past year. Mrs. Dougherty has
visited the lower grades regularly, while my time has been given
largely to Grades VIII and IX and to the High School classes.
Teachers’ meetings have been held every week, and the work, on
the whole, seems to be in growing and prosperous condition.

An exhibition was held at the high school building in Di cember, at which the parents of the pupils and all others interested
were given an opportunity to see some of the results of the pupils’
efforts in the line of art work. Many pleasant words of approval
and commendation were spoken concerning it, encouraging alike to
pupils and teachers.

The art room in the high school has proved itself to be well

 adapted to its purpose, and its equipment is very satisfactory, but it
seems highly desirable that just one thing more should be done to
make the place more attractive, and that is to tint the glaring white

walls with some pleasing color. Our collection of casts would then 
show to much better advantage, and although the cost would be
comparatively small, the whole appearance of the room would be
vastly improved.

In conclusion, wish to offer my sincere thanks to the members of the School Board for their liberality toward the art department, to the Superintendent for his helpful suggestions and advice,
and to my fellow teachers for their cordial co-operation.
Very respectfully yours,
ISABELLE H. FERRY,
Supervisor of Drawing.

REPORT OF THE |
SUPERVISOR OF WRITING.
Mr. Louis P. Nash, Superintendent of Schools. .

Dear Sir :—There is no branch of education of more practical value than that of penmanship, being to many means of livelihood, and to all necessity. This department therefore is one of
importance and sterling worth. It is our aim that every pupil in
our schools attain clear, legible and rapid writing.

Having used the Vertical System during the past two years, and
the pupils having acquired the technicalities, we have directed our
energies this year, to securing facility and ease of execution. The
general exercise work, such as dictation, composition, etc., has been .
given special attention, and quantities of such work have been
retained by the teachers, and kept in some place available to visitors
interested in school work, for their inspection. We have also given
special drill on figures, thereby giving the pupil an idea of the neatness and precision required in accountants’ work. At least once a
term sample of each pupil’s work is sent to the office of the Superintendent of Schools, where it is carefully reviewed and the progress noted. We are anxious that our scholars adopt dignified and
healthful positions during the writing period. Insome of the rooms
in our schools, poorly placed school furniture is hindrance to them
in assuming such positions. Feeling that the Superintendent and
School Committee are anxious that the mind of the child be cultivated
under circumstances most favorable to the development of the
body, would suggest the advisability of adjusting such desks as
are poorly placed, to suit the individual. In conclusion, wish to
extend thanks to the Superintendent, principals, and teachers for
their courtesy, interest and effective co-operation. :

Very respectfully yours, .
ESTHER A. MacDONNELL.

HIGH SCHOOL.
Mr. Louis P. Nash, Superintendent of Schools, Holyoke, Mass.
Dear Sir:—In reply to your request for the annual report of
the Principal, submit the following statement concerning the work
of the past year, the present conditions, and the future plans and —
needs of the high school.

In June class of girls and boys was graduated. A
large majority of these pupils are pursuing advanced work this year ;
  are attending normal schools; have entered colleges; are
taking post-graduate work in the high school; and are attending
business colleges. It will be seen from these statistics that the
high school is fitting school for nearly per cent of its graduates.

The number of pupils in attendance at the close of the school
year in June was  Of these were in the graduating class.
The number of undergraduates was, therefore,  Through failure to earn promotions, of these have been enrolled in the first
year class this year. Three hundred and eleven have been enrolled
in the second, third and fourth classes. Thirty-two, or per cent
of those in attendance at the close of last year, have not returned
this year. Seventeen of those not returning did not gain promotions, and three have left the city. This per cent of loss is no
greater than is usual in many schools, and is smaller than prevails

in some. The total enrolment of the first year class has been  .
Including post-graduates and special pupils, the total enrolment for
the term has been  Upon the basis of the number in attendance
in June, and considering the increased opportunity for work afforded
by the general business improvement, the enrolment this year is as
large as could be expected. The hope of.a larger enrolment did

not take into consideration the fact that of last year’s total enrolment, the unusually large number of  or more than per cent,
left school before the close of the year. It’ would not be rash to
predict that the number remaining for the full year will show a
substantial gain over last year.

ATTENDANCE.

The record of the school in the matter of regularity and punctuality in attendance has been deplored by my predecessors, and is
still so unsatisfactory as to demand thoughtful attention and persistent work. It is shown by the report of that the average total
absences for three years prior to that report were  and that
the average number of tardinesses was  For the school year
  the total number of absences aggregated  and tardinesses  Thus while decided improvement was made in
punctuality last year, the unusual ‘growth of the school evidently
brought in class of pupils very irregular in their attendance.

Systematic efforts have been made this year to improve this
condition in the school, and good results are noticeable, particu. larly in reference to tardiness. This is seen from comparison of
the first four months of with the corresponding months of
 In the former year the aggregate number of tardinesses was

| In order to obtain the co-operation of the home in this work,
a circular note was addressed to each parent or guardian early in the
year, calling attention to the evil, and asking personal attention to
the question. Much responsibility must be assumed by the home
before the desired results can be obtained. Again, school work for
five hours day must be considered as much the business of those
 attending, as is, the work in mill, store or office, the business of
those whose permanent employment there depends upon strict
attention to duty. When school duties are regarded like obligations
in other employments, such indefensible requests as excuses because
of oversleeping, late breakfast, minding children, shopping, visiting,
etc., will be less frequent. .

It should not be considered that this is merely matter of

school records. Absence from even part of school session is a

  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
serious interruption to progress. Moreover, no part of school work
will contribute more to success in life than the habit of punctuality
and regularity—the habit of being ready for opportunity. No part
will contribute more to failure than the habit of being little behind
Opportunity.

THE WORKING PROGRAM.

The actual working program shows that in recitation and supervision there are at the close of the first term double periods
per two weeks. and two periods of music. Four hundred and
ninety-nine pupils are enrolled in English, and in this department
  recitations are conducted bi-weekly. In mathematics there aré
  pupils and go recitations. The modern Janguage department
enrolls pupils, and conducts recitations bi-weekly. In the
other departments the enrolment and number of recitations follow:
Science, pupils and recitations; history, pupils and  
recitations classical languages, pupils and recitations;
bookkeeping, pupils and recitations; stenography, pupils
and recitations typewriting, pupils and recitations manual training, pupils and recitations sewing, pupils and  
recitations cooking, pupils and ro recitations; drawing,  
pupils and recitations.

In addition to the above recitation work, and the ordinary supervision and office work, every teacher devotes at least one afternoon each week to those pupils who for any reason need special
assistance. Some teachers give up two, and often three afternoons
to this work. This afternoon office hour gives an opportunity, also,
for parents to confer with teachers in reference to the work of their
children. Parents are invited to make use of this opportunity, and

- teachers welcome any suggestions whereby the interest of the pupils
or the school may be advanced.
DISCIPLINE.

No feature of our school system has undergone more change
than methods in discipline. Corporal punishment has long since
departed from our high schools, and is gradually losing favor in the .

, ,

, HIGH SCHOOL.  
lower schools. Few probably would suggest return to the former
method. In place of thé old system has come one of control by
various incentives of reward, and penalties, and pupil-honor, or no
control at all. Control by reward or penalty is in turn looked upon
with disfavor by many, who limit legitimate discipline to that
obtained by appeals to pupils’ honor, and through the personal
influence of the teacher. However ideally correct this may be in
theory, in practice it has, in many cases, resulted in liberty in
conduct subversive of the best interests of the schdol and dangerous
to cultivate in prospective citizen of our State. In other words,
the lapse of the more rigid form of discipline has resulted, in many
cases, in no discipline at all. Unfortunately the power of control is
largely an inheritance, nota cultivated quality. It isa gift of nature.
True discipline is not punishment; it is the development of the
power of self-control under all circumstances. It must be as effective in the absence as in the presence ofa teacher. Discipline that
restrains pupil only while under the eye of the teacher is base
hypocrisy.

In the high school no pretension is made to complete selfcontrol on the part of the pupil body, although ample opportunity
is given for such control, and pupils are encouraged in it. All
necessary school regulations are explained as contributing directly
to the best conditions for school work, and pupils are asked to
cheerfully co-operate in observing them. By showing community
of interest in school life, and the fairness and necessity of certain
regulations, by tempering all discipline with justice, and having it
free from carping and sarcasm, generous spirit of co-operation is |
being developed. Cases of serious discipline are rare but privileges
are unhesitatingly taken from pupil when the harm he is doing
the school by his use of them is greater than the good he can possibly derive from them.

GYMNASIUM. |

The gymnasinm has been equipped with clubs, dumb-bells,
chest weights, horizontal bars, parallel bars, climbing ropes and
Poles, mats, etc. As soon as instruction can be provided, systematic
exercise will be required of every pupil. The better bodies that

and fourth year pupils. This has been voluntary work, and indicates the desire on the part of the pupils for regular drill. lady
instructor should be employed to have full charge of the drill of the
girls. Hand in hand with physical culture should go work in elocution, or voice culture, for the whole school. It would not be difficult to find teacher capable of giving instruction in both these
lines.

MUSIC. ;

The program has been changed to allow music period of
forty minutes once per week. It is believed that better results will
be obtained by this arrangement than by having five or ten minutes |
devoted daily to music. Sacred selections still are part of the
daily devotions. The “American Music Reader for High Schools ,
and Academies’ is made the basis of the year’s work, but is to be
supplemented with various selections in pamphlet or sheet form.

For this purpose some music is accessible from that purchased in
previous years, but as this has already been used by three classes,
- new selections should be supplied. Under school organizations we
. shall call attention to several musical clubs formed by. pupils of the ,
school. }
ATHLETICS. :

The school is taking prominent and successful part in the
different branches of athletics. It will undoubtedly establish its
supremacy in Western Massachusetts in our four leading sports.
Eligibility to membership on any team is being regulated by the
practice in vogue in all of our best schools and our colleges namely,
by requiring proficiency in minimum amount of school work. By
this method pupils are stimulated to do better work, the temptation
to take advantage of opposing teams by bringing in outside players
is removed, and pupils that are invariably faithful in their work are
given more equal opportunity for representation upon the teams.

HIGH SCHOOL.  
Such regulations will remove from athletics much of the criticism of
the past, will tend to develop more athletic material, and will establish in other communities our reputation for fairness.

. SCHOOL ORGANIZATIONS.

While the pupils are occupied chiefly in mastering prescribed
or elected course of study, special training is given many in some
one of the various school organizations. These organizations offer
Opportunity for the exercise of responsibility and executive and
business ability for, although each is under the supervision of a
teacher, the actual work is done by the pupils themselves. The
dramatic club, organized last year, has given one successful entertainment this year and is planning another. The Herald is maintaining its literary standard fandj keeping its finances in good 
condition. .A debating society has been organized, and it is the
purpose of the society to arrange contests with the clubs of other
schools. school quartette of mixed voices has been organized
this year, and also glee club of male voices. For instrumental
music there is banjo club of fourteen instruments and an orchestra
of seven pieces. No time is taken from regular school hours for
rehearsals and practice, nor,can it be said that these organizations
seriously interfere with school work. ‘They do, however, form centers of interest in school life, and elevate school work above the
plane of monotonous drudgery. Controlled within proper limits,
they may be of distinct educational value and have healthful influence in school life. Frequently they prevent vicious use of time
by employing hours that would; otherwise be spent in harmful
recreation. It is hoped that some benevolent persons may make it
Possible to hold an annual oratorical contest, at which both boys
and girls will compete for suitable prizes in the form of pictures or
books. Such an organization would have permanent good in the
cultivation of public speaking. |

EIGHTYZMINUTE PERIODS.

The attention of your Committee is called to the present progtam, the main feature of which has been in force during the past
two years. That program calls for three periods of eighty minutes,

... 

  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

in addition to the usual time given to devotions, recess and filing of
classes. Originally this long period was designed to give opportunity for individual work, and for partial preparation of work under
the supervision of the teacher. The general use that in practice has
been made of it does not differ from that of the customary fifty-minute
period in other schools. Such being the actual fact, physiological
and pedagogical reasons would seem to argue against its continuance in other than laboratory studies, unless it revert to its original
intent, which upon trial has been found impracticable. The physiological objection to the long period will be dismissed with mere
reference to the most evident objection—that of obliging pupils to
sit for so long time without the relaxation obtained in passing
from one recitation to another, and the severe mental strain from
protracted concentration upon recitation.

’ Viewed from another standpoint there are several dangers connected with the long period of recitation. With the pupil it will
tend to result either in the over-strain above referred to, or in listlessness during that portion of the period following mental fatigue.
With the teacher, particularly with the young teacher, it will rob the |
recitation of certain incisiveness in attack and vigor in development that is characteristic of the tolerable recitation. Many
moments will be wasted, because of the abundance of time. Again,
each lesson must necessarily be twice the ordinary length, which
fact makes assimilation more difficult or incomplete, while the everyother-day recitation brings more interruption in continuity of study 
than the usual program. Moreover, the program becomes less flex- 
ible, making it difficult to find time for partial subjects as physiology, drawing, music, and physical culture, and gives undue prominence to some of the regular subjects, all subjects being placed
upon an equality in point of time devoted to them. Nearly all of
the best schools have adopted the long period for laboratory work,
and it lends itself with advantage to the nature of that work and
manual training, where time is required in getting ready and putting
away apparatus and tools, and in developing experiments. While
it would not be wise to interrupt the work of the school to make
this change now, it would be generally recognized as progressive
step if our school is organized at the beginning of the next school
year on the basis of minute periods.

HIGH SCHOOL.  
COURSES.

With the exception of drawing, manual training, and domestic
science, the various departments have well developed courses.
Particular attention should be given to broadening the opportunities
in these three departments. In drawing, many more pupils should
be enrolled, but this will not be possible until the full service 
a teacher is provided. It is serious question whether the value of a
course of two hours per week in drawing would not warrant its being 
required of all first year pupils. It would not be expected that all
would produce work of merit. However, an interpretative, if not
constructive ability would be developed. The esthetic cultivation,
the better sense of beauty and proportion, and the habit of closer
observation would repay the hours spent in the work.

Enrolment in classes in manual training and domestic science
has been indirectly and unintentionally discouraged by allowing but
one credit for year’s work. These subjects should be placed upon
an equality with English, history and mathematics. To do this,
opportunity must be offered for more work during school hours, as
no outside preparation is required. It could be easily arranged to
give pupils eight hours in these subjects in the place of four or five

hours given those subjects that require preparation. Many that

. would like these courses will never take them until this change has
been made. On the other hand it is known that many pupils |
attend school purposely to take manual training. They are at| tracted to the school by it. Others need it in preparation for
future work. This is particularly true of boys preparing for scientific
or technological schools, where it is advised in preparation, and
where, in some cases, credit is given it in entrance requirements.

The course in manual training should be expanded. More
time should be given mechanical drawing. Parts of the course
should be elective to girls. course in clay modelling should follow the work in carpentry and precede more extended course in
wood-carving. This could be arranged with very small outlay for
“equipment. Bent iron work could also be provided at small
expense. As soon as the funds are available, forge work should be
introduced, also pattern making and moulding.

If this course is expanded so as to give full credits for year’s

  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE. |
work, if more mechanical drawing is provided for, and if girls are
: admitted to the classes, one teacher would probably be unable to do
all the work demanded. However, it would cost little if any more
to employ an assistant in this department, than in science or language. |
 The courses of study outlined two years ago have been used as
a guide in the selection of individual work, but they do not meet
 the actual demands of the school. For example, there is no course ,
that will fit for college, or normal school, or technical school. Act' ing under the advice of the high school committee, tentative
courses have been drawn up that, followed strictly, will prepare our
pupils for any of the above institutions.

Only small per cent of our pupils, however, go to higher
institutions. Weare concerned mainly in fitting, not for college, but
for citizenship. For this reasona general or English course is
suggested, largely elective, but having for its basis as required sub- )
jects, those studies that contribute most to good citizenship—English and history. In addition to these two, it is suggested that
algebra be required of all the first year, while the remainder of the
four years’ course be left to the choice of pupils under the careful
direction of teachers, and subject to the approval of their parents.
Electives should be arranged by groups or years, and certain subjects should be considered as preparing the way for others. No
pupil should be allowed to elect ahead of his year, although he
might elect from preceding group. Pupils should be advised to
avoid smattering courses, and encouraged to continue subject
once chosen for at least two years.

 SCHOOL AND HOMES.

Special effort has been made to secure the co-operation of the
home and the school, with gratifying results. For this purpose two
circulars have been sent to parents and guardians. One of these
circulars called attention to the pernicious influence of irregularity
in attendance, not only upon the progress of individual pupils, but
upon the general morale of the school. The second circular was of
a more personal nature, and sought information regarding the health
of the pupil, the use of his time out of school, the difficulties and

HIGH SCHOOL. 
demands of his school work, and the school, college or work for
which he was preparing himself. Replies to this circular were
received from nearly every home. The information has been tabulated, and is proving of great value in arranging the work and looking after the interests of individual pupils.

With this much accomplished there remains feeling that even
closer touch with the homes should be obtained. It would be )
distinct contribution to effective conditions for better school work
if parents would, by visitation, become familiar with the actual
school life, our courses of study, method of work, and splendid
equipment. The success and power of school for good depends
as much upon an intelligent, appreciative, and suggestive public cooperation as upon an efficient corps of teachers. We plead for a
strong personal interest and spirit of helpfulness on the part of
every citizen of our city.

CARE OF BUILDING. |

The present provision for the care of the building seems
inadequate. The corridors and class room floors are washed but
three times year. The unwholesomeness and actual filthiness of
the conditions that must prevail under such circumstances, defeat
the efforts of teachers to cultivate in pupils habits of neatness and
care of school property. Beauty and neatness cannot best be
taught by contrast. Class rooms should be washed twice each term
at least, and the corridors twice each month. The additional
expense would be comparatively small, while the gain in the appearance of the building, and in the influence upon pupils would be
almost incalculable.

TEACHERS. .

In trying to realize the aims of the school, the principal is
assisted by most helpful corps of teachers. Each has had special
training in the work of his department, and has enthusiasm for that
work. The responsibility for the work of the different departments
is lightened by the supervision of efficient heads ot departments.
In general personal interest and responsibility is felt by teachers.
With true professional pride, also, the opportunity for work and

  REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
progress is welcomed. If the policy of retaining efficient teachers
even at additional expense, is adopted, the outlook for our schoolis 
very bright. Holyoke can afford to demand such talent in its
teachers, that our school will come to be looked upon as the height
of the teacher’s ambition, rather than the beginning of his service.
Each teacher directly influences the whole school, individually and ,
collectively. From business and moral standpoint, few hundred
dollars should be considered as nothing when compared to the
yearly contribution of tried teachers to the mental and moral training of six hundred of our boys and girls.

Teachers should be encouraged to visit other schools.. Teachers’ conventions furnish certain inspiration for work, but do not
give the practical. suggestions that observation of actual class-room
drill gives. The theory of school work may be obtained from the
abundant literature in the form of school journals. What our teachers most need is to see how practical theories are applied by best

"teachers.
CONCLUSION.

In conclusion let me acknowledge my obligation to the Superintendent and members of the High School Committee for many
suggestions and for hearty support in the four months of my administration. Let me express most hopeful view of the future. The
school is well organized and most departments are well developed
and equipped. Necessary additions to the equipment of some
departments will be communicated to you in another form. In
a large school that will constantly grow larger in response to the
rich courses of study being offered in corps of teachers working
earnestly and happily for single purpose in school spirit developing along the lines of loyalty, of helpfulness and of appreciation
of opportunity, we believe return is being made for the magnificent tribute to the public school which the citizens of the City have
given in the erection of the new high school building.

: Very respectfully yours,
W. C. AKERS.

SEWERS AND DRAINS.

The sewer construction during the past year consisted of a
 -inch vitrified pipe laid in Cabot street for distance of feet
from the Front street sewer, with which it connects, to the first level
canal;  -inch vitrified pipe laid in Howard street from Hampden street sewer feet northerly an  -inch vitrified pipe laid in
Walnut street from Hampden street sewer feet southerly, and an
 -inch vitrified pipe laid in East Dwight street from Center street
to the west curb line of West street.

For some years the Front street sewer has given considerable
trouble, owing to its inability to discharge all the drainage it collects
in times of heavy rainstorms. To relieve this sewer, storm water
sewer would sooner or later have to be built at large expense,
were it not for the Holyoke Water Power Company, who have
granted permission to the city to tap the sewer at one or more
points along its length into the  st level canal. It is trusted the
city will appreciate this favor, it being saving of several thousands
of dollars. ,

One of these taps has already been made in Cabot street by
inserting  -inch pipe in the top of the sewer and having it discharge into the rst level canal two feet below the surface of the
water. It is recommended that another tap be made in Lyman
street, after which no more trouble need be expected from the
gorging of the Front street sewer.

THE WALNUT STREET SEWAGE.

Complaints have been made year after year about the nuisance
caused by the Walnut street sewage as it is now discharged. Your
Engineer, at the request of the Board of Public Works, investigated

!
REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.  
this nuisance with view to the best and most economical method
of abating it.

As result, he has recommended in his report to the Board
that the dry weather flow of the Walnut street sewer system be
diverted from its present outlet above the dam and discharged into
the Front street sewer, which discharges below the dam.’ The cost
of doing this is estimated at sum which it is hoped you
will see fit to appropriate, as by so doing very necessary work will
not only be accomplished, but the public health of great portion
of the city protected. .

| HIGHWAYS AND BRIDGES.
(LINCOLN STREET PAVING.)

Brick pavement was laid this year on Lincoln street between
the street railway track and the north curb from Pleasant street to
Pear! street. ,

The paving was laid with water-struck brick, part of which came
from Greenfield and part from our local yards. The experiment of
using local brick, especially burned, has so far been satisfactory
one and judging from its wear as road metal, in comparison with
the more expensive vitrified brick, it seems as if the local manufacturers with little more effort could make successful paving brick.

CATCH-BASINS. ,

The new form of catch-basin, suggested last year by the Superintendent of Out-Door Work for the street corners around the high
school, has been used in several other places throughout the city
this year. It is decided improvement upon the older form; which
occasioned so much inconvenience to foot travel on account of the
length of the step from the sidewatk to the street.

There are some places where additional catch-basins could be
placed to advantage, particularly in some of our unpaved streets
having steep grades. Here the surface water should be removed
from the streets as soon as possible, otherwise when allowed to flow
some distance its increasing volume and velocity not only impairs
the surface over which the water flows, but ‘in some instances
causes washouts. |

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.  
OLD COUNTY ROAD.
'In BoarD OF ALDERMEN, February .

OrDERED, ‘That the City Engineer be and is hereby authorized and instructed to make survey and estimate the cost of
opening up to public travel the old county road from Northampton
street to the Springfield road.”

The work done by this department in obedience to the above
order was stated by your Engineer in his report presented to the
Board of Aldermen on November .

BRIDGES.

All the iron bridges of the city except those crossing the
canals on Dwight street have been painted the past year; the
Appleton street bridge crossing the  st level canal and the Lyman :
street bridge crossing the  level canal have been replanked, while
the floor beams of the South Main street bridge’ crossing the  d
level canal have been strengthened. In view of replacing the latter

structure, which has been considered unsafe for years, with a
masonry bridge, the Holyoke Water Power Company were solicited
for permission to construct two piers inthe canal. This permission ,
was willingly granted, after which investigations were made to find
out the nature of the foundations upon which it was proposed to
build such an important structure. From borings made by hydraulic
power, it was found that the strata underlying the canal at this
point are composed of layers of sand for depth of feet on the
north side to feet on the south side of the canal. Itcan beseen,
therefore, that masonry bridge would be an expensive structure
and from an economical standpoint could not be recommended in
preference to an iron structure.

In the meantime, or until new bridge is built, it was considered desirable to strengthen the floor beams of the present one;
consequently plans and specifications for doing the work by contract were prepared by this department and executed at cost
of dollars.

The remaining iron bridges, considering the many years of
service which some of them have rendered and the kind of travel

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.

for which they were designed, are in fair condition except that on
Cabot street crossing the  level canal. This bridge your
Engineer considers unsafe for the traffic which it has to carry. Its
floor beams are especially weak, and under the weight of an electric
car filled with passengers are strained to point beyond what is
considered the safe limit. Hence new structure is recommended
as soon as possible, as the economy of strengthening the present
one is rather questionable.

The Bridge street bridge crossing the  level canal is a
wooden structure, the floor beams of which show considerable
deterioration and therefore deserve attention.

ORDERED, ‘‘ That the City Engineer be and is hereby authorized
- and instructed to draw up plans and to estimate the cost of construction of Public Bath Houses. One for Wards and  one for

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.  
Wards and  and one for Ward  The total cost not to exd
fifteen hundred dollars ($ ).”

It will be readily understood that the limit of cost named in
this order would permit of the construction of only the most temporary of structures. However, this department gave the matter
careful study and as result found that it would not only be
impossible to erect three bath houses of any practical worth, but
even two for the sum of  At the request of the Board of
Public Works and in compliance with some subsequent instructions
from this Board, plans and specifications were prepared for one
substantial structure to be erected on the corner of Commercial
and Sargeant streets on plot of land belonging to the Holyoke
Water Power Company.

In accordance with the plans, the bath house was constructed
at cost of  and was opened to the public on June r. It
consists of swimming basin fifty feet in length, twenty )
feet in width and depth of two and one-half feet at one end
to five feet at the other. ‘This basin is surrounded by platform four feet in width which in turn is surrounded by thirtyeight dressing rooms. The basin is constructed of concrete 
masonry while the platform and dressing rooms are of wood. The
water used in the swimming basin is drawn from the city water
main in Commercial street.

GROOVED RAILS.

During the latter part of the year, the Holyoke Street Railway |
Company at the request of the Board of Public Works laid grooved
rails on Dwight street. 

This form of rail has been in use and has given thorough satisfaction in other cities, especially when laid in modern paved streets
where the common form of rail should have no place. Hence it is
recommended that the grooved rail replace the common form in all
our paved streets through which the street cars run.

Number of warnings sent,  
Number of prosecutions—‘‘Selling milk of not standard

Number of prosecutions— “Selling milk without license,’  

  INSPECTOR OF MILK, VINEGAR AND PETROLEUM. .

The reason for sending warnings instead of prosecuting was
that the general quality of all samples taken was good, and in three
cases it was evidently due to carelessness in handling, as most of
these samples were taken from cans partly full.

The three cases of “selling milk of not standard quality were

| cases left over from last year. In each case the parties pleaded
guilty and paid the court fine of  each.

) Of the seven cases of seliing milk without license,” five were
storekeepers, who paid fines of  each; one milk peddler, who
paid fine of The other case was acquitted on the ground
that the milk did not belong to him, he acting as common carrier.

The quality of milk sold here has decidedly improved. This
statement make not only from my own analysis and observations,
but from others who are in position to judge. The Board of
Health has helped me as much as possible, and have done all I
could for them.

In April, through the influence of the Mayor, the Board of
Public Works fitted up room in the top of the City Hall as a
laboratory, thus giving chance to do work that was impossible in
my former quarters.

I have spent all my time on inspection work, and have asked
compensation and more money to extend the value of this department, which has not been granted. have now on my books  
licensed peddlers and stores and stands, and, in justice to the
office, should spend all my time and have an assistant ali the time.
There is work enough for two men every day in the year. would
respectfully suggest that the inspector of milk and vinegar be madea
department of the Board of Health (as it is in Boston), and that an
appropriation of  be made for same. ‘There were copies
of my report of last year printed, together with the laws in regard
to milk, butter and vinegar, also the ordinance in regard to kerosene oll. These have given to milk peddlers and storekeepers.
As there have been some changes in them this year, it would be well
to have them printed again next year.

I wish to thank his Honor, the Mayor, for his assistance and
advice and also for granting an assistant part of the time. wish
to thank my assistant, John J. Roy, for his work with me, which has
been very satisfactory.

INSPECTOR OF MILK, VINEGAR AND PETROLEUM.  
VINEGAR.

Hearing many complaints of the quality of vinegar being sold
here, took samples from places, and found that there was low
grade vinegar sold in number of them. The result was that I
have entered cases in court. have the assurance from number of wholesalers that they will see that the goods will be up to the
standard after this.

OLEOMARGARINE. .

There has been one license taken out this year.

I have taken samples of butter, and have not found any to
be oleo. have had three cases of selling ‘‘ renovated butter,” that
were not marked according to law, but as this is new law did
not enter them, as they promised to live up to the law in the future.

, PETROLEUM.

 All the kerosene used in this city for illuminating purposes is
shipped here in tank cars, and have inspected of them this
year. If calculated as barrels it would amount to about  .

The kerosene oil sold here this year, as rule, has been low
test, but has all come up to the test required by law. The price —
has been going up, but the quality does not.

REPORT OF
INSPECTOR OF ANIMALS AND
: PROVISIONS.
HoLyoxE, Mass., December .
To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen of the City

of Holyoke:

The health of all the domestic animals within the city limits is
good at present. During the year have quarantined several cattle
suffering from an infectious disease known as tuberculosis. All

. the infected cattle have been killed and the owners paid by the
State Cattle Commission. The sale of bob veal has been, during
- the past year, suppressed to very great extent. detected four
dealers in bob veal, had warrants issued for their arrest, and all

were fined.

Two banana peddlers were arrested and fined for selling
decayed fruit. ‘The dealers in bob veal do their work at night,
coming in from the country at midnight to avoid detection, but
with the help of the pulice force have sucded in detecting them.
The Health Officer has worked in co-operation with me to render
the city free from contagious disease amongst animals and improve
the sanitary condition of the stables throughout the city. have
ordered the owners of ten stables, where animals were too closely
housed, to put in ventilators and windows to suit the size of the
different stables.

I have made thorough examination of all the neat cattle
within the city limits, and the sanitary condition of all the stables
and yards connected therewith, and have forwarded report of the
same to the State Board of Cattle Commissioners.

Yours respectfully,
) JOHN J. MOYNAHAN.

REPORT OF
BOARD OF HEALTH.
To the Honorable Mayor and Board of Aldermen:

 GENTLEMEN :—In compliance with the Public Statutes the
Board of Health herewith respectfully submit for your consideration
the nineteenth annual report :

The board met for ‘organization on the first Monday in Febtuary, electing the following officers: Chairman, Dr. Arthur B. :

. Wetherell; Secretary, Dr. Frank A. Woods; Health Officer, Mr.
Jeremiah J. Linehan Clerk, Mr. Joseph A. Murray.

During the year ending November this board have
endeavored to extend the work of this department in all of its
various lines, and as result, it is their pleasure to submit for your
inspection city which is more clean, more sanitary and consequently more healthy than ever before.

The constantly increasing number of complaints and petitions
add greatly to the work of the board, requiring, as they doina large
majority of the cases, inspection of the premises involved. This
means corresponding increase in the amount of travel] by the
members of the board. The purchase of team for the use of the
department would greatly facilitate its work, allow better oversight of the men employed and reduce the item of travel expense,
which at the present time is considerable.

BAKERIES.

Such yearly inspections of the bakeries and their surroundings
as is prescribed by law have been made. Taken as whole these
important places, where so much of our food product is manufac  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.

 tured, have been found in good condition. number of minor
changes have been suggested and their enforcement will be carefully attended to. There are at present twenty-three bakeries within our city limits. |

UNDERTAKERS, |

The licensing of undertakers by this board, as required by the
state statutes, have placed the workings of this department more  
directly under our control. Ten licenses have been granted to |
engage in this business, all having complied with the law.

There is now an increased attention shown in the detail of ,
statistics required in the return of death. This greatly adds to the ,
value of the statistics which are so valuable.

The law relative to the burial of all those dying from contagious
disease, and the preparation of those who have been thus affected
and are to be removed from the city for burial, is being rigidly |
enforced. As result the danger from the spread of contagion
from this source is greatly reduced. |

i
SLAUGHTER HOUSES. :

All slaughter houses and manufacturers of sausage and prepared |
meat within the city are now granted licenses by this board. |

The supervision of the places of business of those thus engaged, |
thus entailed, has caused an improvement in the character of the
articles furnished to the public for consumption.

The Inspector of Meat and Provisions has worked in full co- !
operation with the board, and as result there is less diseased meat
exposed for sale. For some time the board have known that the |
importation of diseased meat and bob veal” was being carried on
to some extent at night. Close watch has proven that such was
the case and several prosecutions have served to greatly diminish
such practice.

FRUIT AND VEGETABLES.

The board have continued to wage war on the poor fruit and

vegetables furnished the public, and the improvement noted last
|

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
year has continued this year. The board consider this very
important line of work and find that it is being appreciated by
the public. ]

BARNS AND LIVERY STABLES. ,
All applications for the erection or use of buildings as barns or
livery stables have received careful consideration and the sites of
location have been inspected. Licenses for the construction and
use of such have been granted with few exceptions. People are
becoming more familiar with this law and there is less tendency
for the evasion of the same noted.
PLUMBERS. ,
The Board of Plumbing Examiners have examined all candidates referred to them for examination by this board. There have
been fourteen applications made to this board for plumber’s licenses
this year five for master plumber’s license and nine for journeyman’s
license. Of this number all five applications for master plumbers’ license have been granted and three of those applying for journeyman’s license.
INSPECTION OF SECOND-HAND DEALERS AND
JUNK DEALERS. |
The board accompanied the Committee on Licenses in its
annual inspection of second-hand dealers and junk dealers.
The board would respectfully recommend that fewer licenses
be granted to these people, who in many cases use this business as
a cloak for crime. This class are responsible for much of the filth
about the city, and acceptance of the above suggestion would aid in
simplifying this work. Ifthe ordinances could be so amended as
to require each junk dealer to have his name and license number
on his wagon it would greatly aid in our work.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
TRAMP ROOM, PADDED CELL AND LOCK-UP.

The board must again call attention to the tramp room, padded
cell and lock-up. Some other place than the present quarters
should be provided at once for the accommodation of the tramps.
As noted last year the present quarters are not only too small, but
are unsuited for their present use, besides being nuisance. The
board would urgently request that some action be immediately
taken toward remedying this matter. The padded cell also
demands immediate attention. This room is often necessity, and
the present one is unfit for human occupancy. Some system of
ventilation should be established for the lock-up. There is a
demand for better air in these detention rooms, and also freedom

. from the presently existing vermin.
INSPECTOR OF MILK AND VINEGAR.

The board indorses the work of the Inspector of Milk in his
endeavor to obtain for the city purer milk supply.

The board would suggest that the Inspector of Milk be placed
under this board, as is the case in most cities. In this way there
could be more satisfactory oversight of this .work that is in
reality part of the work of the Board of Health.

GENERAL WORK. :

The general work of keeping the city clean requires much
more time, care and attention by the members of this board than
is evident to any one who does not take especial interest in the
work and thus look into the subject. Much of this work lies in
abating small nuisances which affect only the localities in which
they exist. Dirty cellars, tenements and other buildings and stores
come under this head, and upon this work many times depends
the health of the locality. This tenement work not only tends to
directly decrease the mortality, but is great aid in the prevention
of epidemics. If each property owner would see to it that his
tenements and their surroundings are kept in clean condition it

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
would greatly aid this board in this very important work. The 
appended report of the Health Officer gives detailed report of
this work.

SANITARY INSPECTION. .

The board can report that the work in this division of its
department under the supervision of Plumbing Inspector Joseph
A. Murray has been carried on in the same thorough manner that
has characterized it during the past few years. Although the report
of the Plumbing Inspector shows that there has been less new work
done in the city during the past year, as evidenced by the number
of permits granted, the old work replaced has more than made up
the number of inspections required.

VAULTS AND CESSPOOLS.

The board has continued its endeavors to have all of the old
vaults and cesspools removed wherever the sewer privileges will permit. Over two hundred of these vaults have been removed at the
order of the board.

SEWERS AND DRAINS.

The board wish to call attention again to the Walnut street
sewer. Its outlet above the dam in the river is becoming more and
more of nuisance year by year, and the board would recommend
that some plan be at once approved to change the outlet and thus
abate the nuisance. |

The board is unanimous in the opinion that no sewage should

be allowed to enter the river above the dam, and any such plan will
be strenuously opposed.

The board also wish to call attention to the Essex street, the —
Front street, and the Jackson street sewers. Complaints have been
received in these districts concerning backing up of water. This
has been more frequent in the district covered by the Essex
street sewer. number of cellars have been flooded, and the danger
resulting therefrom is considerable.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.

The board would recommend that in some way these sewers be
relieved from the pressure of storm water.

The board wish to again recommend that house-to-house
inspection of plumbing be made. That there is still much plumbing.
within the city which needs the attention of the board is evident,

) but itis impossible for this board with its present force to make this
desired inspection. The board would recommend that special
appropriation be made for this work and that at least part of the
work be done during the coming year.

VITAL STATISTICS. .

The board takes especial pleasure in reporting the work of
this branch of our department. For the past two years the board
have been establishing series of statistics which will fill all of the
requirements in the line of records. This work has become necessary owing to the large number of inquiries that come to this office
from many sources, among which are the different departments of

. the Government and the various State Boards of Health, for
statistics in the different subjects now included in the tabulation of
mortality.

The record of this city for the past twelve months is one in
which the department take just pride. Not only is the number of
deaths less this year than for any year since  but the death
rate is lower than that of any year for the past fifteen years. This
is considered exceptional in manufacturing city, where the population is as variable and of such large per cent foreign.

 The number of deaths during has been  as compared

to during  the death rate for the year is reduced from

  in to during  decrease of per
thousand inhabitants.

The following list of tables shows the number of deaths, the
age at death, the cause of death, the nativity and burial places of

REPORT OF BOARD OF H&ALTH.  
CONTAGIOUS DISEASES.
This city has reason to congratulate itself that no epidemics of
a contagious nature have occurred within its limits during the past
year. Although almost without exception our surrounding cities
and towns have been visited by epidemics of various contagions,
we are able to report substantial decrease in the number of cases
of contagious disease. There have been reported during the past
year cases of contagious disease, as compared with cases
during  decrease of per cent. Diphtheria has been much
more prevalent here during the year ending November ,
than during  but at no time has it approached an epidemic.
Typhoid fever has also increased, but there have only been cases
of this disease during the year. All other contagious diseases have
been on the decrease, and even in the two in which we report an
increase the death rate has decreased. This year we report  
cases of diphtheria with deaths, while last year we had cases
with ro deaths. During we had cases of typhoid fever
with deaths, and in we had cases with deaths. The
total number of contagious diseases this year has been with
  deaths, as compared with cases and deaths in  .
During the past year the board has purchased formaldehyde
disinfecting machine, and all fumigation is now done under the
direct supervision of the board. This is found to be much more
satisfactory, as under the old regime much of the fumigation existed
in name only, and there was, consequently, an increased opportunity for the spread of disease. After considerable investigation
the board has made arrangements to have bacteriological examination made of all doubtful or supposed cases of diphtheria.
Cultures will be taken from the throats of all who are thus affected
and microscopical examination made. This will determine
definitely what of these cases are diphtheria and what are not.
‘This will undoubtedly increase our number of cases of diphtheria,
as Many cases now supposed to be common sore throat are doubtJess light attacks of diphtheretic nature, but it will insure us
better protection from contagion.
A full set of maps of the city is now in the possession of the
board, showing the exact location of every case of contagious

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
nature that has existed within the city during the past year. This
greatly aids in locating unhealthy parts of the city, as well as the
search for the cause of the same.

The need of some hospital or building for cases of contagious
nature is being felt more and more every year. Many cities even
smaller than Holyoke now possess such hospitals, and the board
would recommend that steps be taken toward obtaining such a
building for this city.

The following tables show the exact extent of contagious disease
in the city during the past year, the number of cases of each disease,

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
GARBAGE AND HOUSE OFFAL.

The work in this very important branch of our department has
been pushed with persistency, and the present condition of our
alleys and the work of gathering house offal is the result of the efficient work of our Health Officer, Mr. J. J. Linehan, under the
direction of the board. Early in the year the board decided to
take determined stand in the matter of the separation of the house
offal from the ashes and other refuse. Of course many obstacles
have been met, but the present condition is entirely satisfactory to the
board, the plan having been in operation only one year. This
arrangement has caused an increased amount of work to all those
engaged in gathering the house offal, owing to the fact that. previously much of the house offal was mixed with the ashes. The
collection of the house offal has this year been under the direction
of Mr. M. J. Haley, and that the work has been faithfully and satisfactorily done is evidenced by the few complaints that have been
received.

The collection of garbage is requiring an additional amount of
work every year. During the past year about loadsof this 
material has been collected, an increase of about loads over
that of last year. At present our dumping grounds are filling the
requirements, but with the present yearly increase it will be but
a short time when other arrangements must be made to meet the
demand. .

The only satisfactory way to do this will be the establishment
of crematory, which would care for the garbage and also for the
house offal. The board would recommend that the city take measures to investigate this subject with the end in view of erecting such
a place for the use of this department.

The appended report of the Health Officer gives the detail of
the work in this branch of the department.

REPORT OF HEALTH OFFICER.
To the Board of Health.

GENTLEMEN: This report represents the work of the Health
Officer during the past year, showing the number of persons notified to make changes in their property to comply with health laws
and the removal of nuisances from their premises.

During the past year it was found necessary to take legal action
against six persons for the violation of health rules, who had
received previous warning, conviction being secured in each case.

I am happy to state to the board that the improvement noted
in my last year’s report in the sale of decayed fruits and vegetables .
and produce still continues, and at the present time no fault can be
found with any of those articles wholesaled or retailed in the city. )

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  

In addition to testing new plumbing and repair work, large
number of tests of old plumbing have been made at the request of
property owners and sometimes tenants who wish to know the
condition of the sanitary arrangements before renting or purchasing building.

Many nuisances have been abated on verbal notices from the
Inspector, without action by the board, and of which no records
have been made.

Thanking you for your confidence in the past, and hoping
that may merit the same in the future, remain,

JOSEPH A. MURRAY, |
Inspector of Plumbing.
