MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
Gentlemen of the Board of Aldermen :

In the year  the City Government of Holyoke
was organized under what wastermed at thattime model
charter. Under this charter the city has attained high
degree of prosperity, and has, in the main, been well governed. It has passed through the stages of infancy and
adolescence and arrived at the age of maturity. Our
population has increased from to  many
large manufacturing interests have been added to our
various industries the valuation of the city has increased
from  in to  in  gain of
$  the duties and responsibilities of the heads of
the departments of the city have also increased and with
a steady increase of all that pertains to good government |
and successful administration of the same, it seemed best
to secure for the city new charter, one more in keeping
with the requirements of the present time. new charter
has been obtained, legally accepted by the voters of this
city, and to-day its provisions go into effect, and the incoming city government will be organized under its dispensation. trust that under its provisions municipal affairs
may be administered economically, honestly and judiciously that representative men of the city may be so interested in its affairs that good government may prevail
and that its future may be even more prosperous than its
past.

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS.

We have been selected by the citizens of Holyoke to
administer the affairs forthe municipal year of  Our
election would seem to indicate that our fellow-citizens
had confidence in our ability as their representatives, believed that we were capable and honest, that we would attend to the duties that devolve upon us faithfully and
conscientiously, and do all that lay in our power to so rect our municipal affairs as to merit their commendation.

Let us not forget that the offices that we this day assume are fraught with serious responsibility. During the
past three years financial and mercantile affairs and the "
various mannfacturing interests of the country have been
in very unsatisfactory condition. ‘There has been general business depression throughout the country, and our
city has not been an exception in this general depression.
Many of our industries have been obliged to curtail their
production, as there has not been the usual demand for
their manufactures. In some cases it has been deemed
best to diminish the wages paidtoemployees. Asaresult,
many of our people have had their working hours diminished in number those who have been fortunate in having
more work to do have found that the change in daily —
wages, although slight, made marked diminution in the
weekly or monthly receipts, and in many cases it has required the most rigid economy to make the receipts equal
the absolutely necessary expenses. If the people are prosperous, our merchants and tradesmen prosper, and the reverse is equally astrue. From itscitizensand manufacturing
industries the city draws its financial support, and during
these times of business depression it behooves us to carefully look after the financial interests of the city and see
that not dollar of the city’s money is wasted or foolishly
or carelessly expended or in any way used so that the city
does not receive full value for every expenditure. We
need not be niggardly in our expenditures, but we must
be economical. The various departments of the city
should receive the necessary appropriations, but let them

MAYOR’S ADDRESS.  
confine their expenses to the lowest possible amount that
will suffice to maintain and keep them in good, healthy
working condition. It is necessary each year that some improvements should be made in several departments; this
year let them be made in the interests of economy and the
best interests of the city. By so doing we shall maintain
a reasonable rate of taxation and not impoverish our citizens; desirable and successful industries will not be
driven away nor other industries be prevented from locating here by the bugaboo of heavy taxation.

The report of the city treasurer gives the following as

BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS. :

With the incoming administration, Board of Public
Works will be appointed, which, in the language of the }
charter, ‘‘shall have cognizance, direction and control (a)
of the construction, location, repair, care and lighting of
streets, ways and sidewalks, (b) of.the construction, alteration, repair and care of public buildings, (c) of the construction, repair and care of main drains or common
sewers, (d) of the construction, alteration, repair, care and
maintenance of public bridges, (e) of the care, superintendence and management of the public grounds, except
public parks belonging to the city, and of the shade and
ornamental trees growing therein.’’ Thus you will see
that this board will assume all the duties of the present
Committee on Highways, Sidewalks and Bridges; Fuel
and Street Lights; City Property and Sewers. The charter provides that the City Engineer shall be the clerk of
the board; but as it will be impossible for him to attend to
these duties and exercise proper supervision over his department, would recommend that an assistant clerk be
chosen by the board to assist in these duties, and that suitable accomodations be prepared for the occupation and
transaction of the business of the board.

I think no permanent improvements have been made
in the highway, department during the past year. The
collection of assessments for sewers, built under the direction of the proper authorities,  constant source of discomfort and irritation, and trust the experience of the
city in this matter during the past year may never be repeated. In many cities sewers are built and paid for by
the city and an entrance fee charged  some cities different arrangements are made. It is my wish that you give
the subject full consideration during the year and evolve
some plan that will be just, equitable and satistactory to
the city and to the taxpayers. With an Inspector of Public Buildings who will attend to his duties faithfully and

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
ever look solely for the best interests of the city, trust
that all property belonging to the city will be well and
carefully looked after, and that the city will sustain no
loss from carelessness or extravagance on the part of the
board or inspector. It would be well for you to consider
thoroughly the matter of street lighting. The contract
with the Holyoke Water Power Company will expire in
 and some action should be taken this year whereby
the necessary arrangements can be made so that when the
present contract expires we may be fully prepared to meet
any and all emergencies. For the details relating to the
several departments referred to, would refer you to the
reports of their several committees.

CITY ENGINEER.

The report of the City Engineer is worthy of careful
perusal and its recommendations should be carefully considered. The expenses of the department for the year  
are The engineer’s remarks relative to the
bridges across the canals and the Connecticut river at
South Hadley Falls and Willimansett are decidedly emphatic, and such of that property as belongs to or is in the
care of the city should be attended to at our earliest convenience. It is not economy to allow costly property to
deteriorate for want of repairs or painting; neither should
the city allow its bridges to become unsafe, thereby incurring the liability of injury to person or property, so that
the city may be liable for claims and suits for damages.

I fully agree with him in his recommendations regarding permanent improvements on the streets and especially
the removing and relaying of the pavement in our streets ;
in some of the streets owing to carelessness in this respect
the condition is very bad. In all cases no paving should
be taken up and relaid without permission of the Board of
Public Works, and under the personal supervision of the
Superintendent of Streets. The recommendations of the
City Engineer regarding the disposal of surface water in

MAYOR’S ADDRESS. II
the city so that the capacity of sewers in various parts of
the city may not be overtaxed during unusually hard
showers or storms of rain, thereby causing the flooding of
cellars and injury to the streets, merit your serious consideration.

FIRE DEPARTMENT.

The Fire Department is an expensive necessity. "The
report of the commission assures us that we have the
necessary apparatus and all the various appliances for
fighting fires successfully; and that the chief and his assistants have corps of men alert, able, willing and ever
ready to assist them) in the necessary duties appertaining
to the department. The life of fireman is fraught with
danger and at times that life is sacrificed in rescuing or attempting to rescue the unfortunates whose lives are imperiled by the flames. Fortunately the city of Holyoke
has not been compelled to call for sucha sacrifice. The
fireman is entitled to and should receive generous compensation for his services. The corps should be composed of
men temperate, honest, courageous and resolute, whose
only ambition should be to discharge their duties faithfully and. well. With such body of men, department
cannot fail to achieve success. If there are any who cannot or will not strive to attain excellence in this respect,
they are not entitled to recognition and should be replaced
by others who are good and true. The expenses of the
department, while necessarily large, should be kept at
the lowest possible amount conducive to successful ad- )
ministration of the same. During the past year there were
  fires and alarms. The total loss was insurance received leaving net loss of .

engine, new house and repairs on the present houses
are worthy of attention.

WATER BOARD.

An abundant supply of pure water is an inestimable
boon to any city. Holyoke, more fortunate than many
cities in the state, receives its supply from natural ponds
or lakes. The increasing growth of the city, however,
renders it desirable and necessary that an increased supply
should be provided for, in order to guard against any
future contingency. Accordingly, during the past year, a
document has been prepared and received legislative sanction whereby an unfailing supply of pure water can be obtained within the limits of our neighboring town of Southampton. large amount of work has already been done
and the prospects are that, ere the year shall have
been stricken from the caiendar, we shall receive an additional water supply that will suffice for city of  
inhabitants. The Holyoke Water Works is one of the best
managed and most prosperous departments in the city.
With the cash on hand to pay for the water bonds due in

fund, so that it will be fully prepared to meet all its liabilities when due.

ARMORY.

We have first-class company of the State Militia in
the city which well deserves more commodious and more
convenient quarters. The rooms for the storage of guns
and other military property are small, inconvenient and
difficult of access; while the city hall is used for the drilling of the men and the manual of arms and marching,
much to the detriment of the hall and building. would
reconimend that some action be taken this year to ascertain
if satisfactory arrangements can be made with the state
authorities, so that better quarters can be provided for the
officers and men, the storage of state property, and commodious drill shed. |

PARKS.
t

The several parks in this city have been well cared for
during the past year and some improvements have been
made. For comparatively small outlay, the park exten  MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
ding from Bh to Maple street could be very much improved and made one'of the pleasantest and most inviting
places in the city.

BOARD OF HEALTH.

The reports of the Board of Health and City Physician
assure us that earnest and successful work has been done
to improve the sanitary condition of the city. Much has
been accomplished in this respect and much still remains
to be done; but if the work of the board is continued on
the present lines, in short time the city will rank as the
peer of any in the Commonwealth inthe matter of sanitary
improvements and general good health. There has been
a marked diminution in zymotic and contagious diseases
during the past few years; the general health of the city
has improved and the death rate has decreased. The
principal expense in this department is in the care of the
alleys, and the disposal of the garbage gathered therefrom. The city does not possess dumping grounds although repeated requests have been made for such
premises. It is only by suffrance that the rubbish can be
disposed of at the present time. In comparatively brief
period the city will be compelled to erect and maintain a
crematory or have its rubbish removed on cars on one of
our railroads. would recommend that the matter of
erecting crematory be investigated and facts and estimates be obtained concerning the same. would also
recommend that such action be taken by the Board of
Aldermen as would ensure the paving of the alleys on
each side of High street from Lyman to Cabot street,
which is much needed improvement both as regards
economy in cleaning and sanitation.

The expense of this department for was ,

OVERSEERS OF THE POOR.

' The continued depression in business, the lack of employment for many willing hands, the inability of many
to obtain any work will undoubtedly result in an increased
demand upon the city for assistance from some and perhaps many who have heretofore been able to sustain themselves and families. Thethree years of what is commonly
and tersely called ‘‘hard times’’ have exhausted the savings of previous years, and now many are without money
and unable to find work; to such it is no disgrace to receive assistance from the city through the proper authorities. The overseers of this department are capable men,
and through their agent, the almoner, will expend wisely
and well such moneys as may be appropriated for the
worthy poor. During the past year an addition has been
nade to the almshouse so that those who, by force of circumstances, are obliged to find home there can receive
better care and attention than has been possible in the
past. The net expenses of this department for were
$  and the net expense of the almshouse was ;
the average cost per inmate was  per week.

CITY SOLICITOR.

The report of the City Solicitor shows that during the
past year the interests of the city have been attended to
faithfully and conscientiously. In suits against the city,
he has carefully prepared his defense, and labored earnestly
to protect and defend the city against all unjust and exorbitant claims for damages. It was not to be expected that |
success should attend all his efforts in this line, for in many
of his cases he has worked at great disadvantage; but
the able and faithful manner in which he has attended to
the duties of his office, deserves and should receive commendation. Exceptin the Municipal Signal Co.’s case,
which was tried in Suffolk County, there has been no extra

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS. |
.
expense to the city for senior counsel. The recommendations of the Solicitor are pertinent and well grounded and
it will be for the interest of the city to have them carried
out.
SCHOOLS.

Holyoke may well be proud of its public schools. Intimate association with our school system during the past
sixteen years justifies me in saying that the standard of
education in this city is high and should be eminently
satisfactory to our citizens. Our school system is well
founded on broad and comprehensive basis. The school
board has always been earnest, active and indefatigable in
its efforts to have our school rank among the best in the
Commonwealth. In this they have recetved the loyal support of the department officers and all teachers, general
and special. Without egotism, let me assure you that the
city has been well and worthily represented on the school
board, and trust thatin the future its representation may
not deteriorate.

This is an expensive department, but think that it
furnishes value received, for in my estimation the public
schools of our country are its best, strongest and greatest
safeguard. The expense of the schools in was

. number of teachers about the expense was and the number of teachers employed  The amount of money necessary to deray the
expense of our schools is more than one-fourth of the entire amount raised by taxation in each year, and it  very
desirable that the custodians of this fund should be wise,
discreet, capable and honest. The enrollment in the pub: lic schools for the year ending in June,  was  in

The recommendations for additional school rooms at

Springdale, Oakdale and on the Highlands should be

carefully considered. It is estimated that the cost of ad- )
ditional accommodations for school purposes, that is, rent
of rooms outside of school buildings, will amount to 
during the current year. In addition to the annual appropriation for school purposes, special appropriation may
be needed for the equipment of our new high school
building.

LICENSE.

A minority of the legal voters of our city are firm believers in the theory of no license. They are earnest and
honest in their belief, and they should be respected for
sustaining their opinion with their votes. On the other
hand, majority of the votes cast at the late election were
for licensing the sale of spirituous liquors. This is in accordance with the laws of the commonwealth which legalizes the sale of alcholic stimulants under certain rescrictions, giving the voters of each city and town the authority to decide as to whether or not they will aliow such
sale under the imposed restrictions. If no-license majority would prohibit the sale of alcohol in its. various forms
absolutely, have no doubt but that such majority would
be obtained each year. But such is not the case. Some
of you will remember the disgraceful scenes that occurred
during the days of state prohibition, when ,the laws relating to the liquor trafic were enforced by state constables.
who were neither above nor beyond the suspicion of being
in collusion with those selling intoxicants illegally. In
this city the license commissioners issue licenses to such a
number as are entitled by law to engage in such business,
demanding that they shall observe the law in each and
every respect, otherwise their license will be forfeited. I
trust that the license commissioners will insist that all
who hold licenses shall in all respects obey the laws. As
for unlicensed and illegal sellers of intoxicants, it is my
desire fhat the police shall compel them to obey the laws

  MAYOR’S ADDRESS.
and shall exercise such constant supervision over all engaged in this business as to make it very unpleasant and
unprofitable for them at all times.

POLICE.

The police force of the city consists of Marshal,
Assistant Marshal, Captain, Lieutenant, Detective and
forty patrolmen, so that  would seem we were well provided for in the matter of police protection. ‘The receipts
for the year, including appropriations and receipts from
fines, were For expenses we have the pay roll,
$ miscellaneous making total of ,

thorough discipline and always obedient to their officers ;

The recommendations of the Marshal regarding police signal system, suitable quarters for the detention of
boys and the better class of offenders, change in the organization of special police and the appointment of reserve special police force under the ‘‘civil service rules’’
should receive due consideration, and if found desirable
and necessary should be carried into effect.

CONCLUSION.

GENTLEMEN :—Briefly have called your attention to
the several departments and commissions in our city. A
full account of their doings will be found in their report
for  would advise you to examine these reports
carefully and thoroughly to ascertain if, in your judgment,
the city has received in service, labor and material the

MAYOR’S ADDRESS.  
equivalent for money expended. careful perusal of
these documents will materially assist you in preparing
your estimates for the various departments for the current

 year. Prepare yourestimates carefully; be just and liberal
with each department, but not extravagant, and when the
appropriations are made, confine each department to its
specified amount and not allow this to be exded unless
some serious special emergency arises. Under model
charter the people expect model administration, and this
can only be obtained by each and all working to the best
of his ability for the best interests of the city. Let us all
render our best service in administering the affairs of our
city honestly, prudently, economically and judiciously, so
that when our term of service is ended our acts may merit
and receive unqualified approval from all our citizens who
are interested in good government.

- REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON
| ANNUAL REPORT.
TQ the Citizens of the City of Holyoke:

The Committee in this report will deal chiefly with the
salient points that demand consideration, leaving to the
several reports presented herewith departmental detail.

The harmony and courtesy existing among the members of.the Committee is source of congratulation. The
unanimity of action which has generally characterized the
Committee’s work, is sufficient evidence of purpose and effort for the public weal.

The administration of the schools prods upon the
right lines. The new rules adopted by the Committee,
giving the Superintendent the selection of teachers, instead
of the District Committees,  long step forward. Other
changes made in the rules give the Superintendent such
authority as should belong to the head of the schools. The

' object has been to place power and responsibility in his
hands. By giving the necessary scope of authority and
freedom of action within his proper sphere, full opportun- |
ity is given him for the carrying out of improved methods
of education and the upbuilding of the work in our schools.
At the last annual election, Preston W. Search, formerly
of Los Angeles, Cal., was elected Superintendent of schools.
The new head of the schools has met with hearty co-operation from the teachers and all concerned in the schools, and
has introduced new rules and regulations and many ideas
that meet with general approval.

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

To testify fittingly to the close of the twenty-five years
of public service in the schools of this city, Miss E. T.
Finch and Miss A. M. Morgan were presented with certificates. The Committee feel that such devotion to public
duty should not pass mention, as it is of interest to pupils,
teachers, patrons and all concerned in the welfare of the
schools.

The work of the evening schools shows steady improvement over last year and an extension is recommended. To
meet the wishes of those pupils who show an honest pur‘pose to seize the advantages offered, it has been thought
advisable by way of experiment to start an evening grammar school in the Lyman street building. This building
has been selected as its use has been discontinued as day
school, so that it can be used entirely for that purpose.
The inconvenience caused by having day and evening
schools in the same building is therefore obviated. This
building has been fitted with such furniture as could be
found, suitable for that purpose. The advantages to be
derived from using this particular building more than offset any inconvenience that may be found, in the matter of

, location. Upon the success of this experiment will depend
further development in this line.

The new West street school has been opened and
twelve of the sixteen rooms already occupied. It is fitted
with all modern improvements and will compare favorably
with any of its kind. :

The new High school will be finished some time during the coming year. special appropriation of at least
$  should be made for its proper equipment. This fine
structure, in which every citizen takes pride, should be .
equipped with all modern appliances arid the amount
named is we think the minimum that will be required.
This is of course in excess of the usual school appropriation. The rapid growth of the Holyoke schools calls for
increased appropriation next year. The Nonotuck street
building is already filled and it is necessary to use five

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
outside rooms for the accommodation of pupils. There is
urgent need in that locality for new building. There is
also need of new building in Oakdale. The pupils in

this section, at much inconvenience, have been compelled
to go to the South Chestnut, the Appleton and Nonotuck
street schools, which are already overcrowded. If the city
cannot put building in Oakdale at present, at least suitable site should be secured next year.

The needs of Springdale must also be pointed out.
The growth of the city in that section and Ingleside calls
for some provision to be made. The present quarters are
entirely inadequate. It would be well to enlarge the present building by the addition of several rooms. The same
condition exists in South Holyoke. The Hamilton street
and other buildings in that locality are overcrowded, and
three outside rooms are now in use. The rapid increase in
the number of school children there must be met by more
accommodation. Department teaching, which has been
experimental in the Appleton street building this last year,
has been extended to several other grammar school buildings, it having been found to be successful. By this system each teacher is allowed certain study, to be taught
by that teacher in all the different grades. In this way the
teacher best adapted for certain branch, has charge of
that study.

The Training school which has been in existence the
past six years, will be discontinued at the end of this
school year, in accordance with vote previously taken by
the Board. AI persons appointed hereafter as teachers in
the Holyoke schools must fulfill the requirements distinctly
laid down in the rules of the Board.

Manual training, which has been given forthe past few
years, has not yet reached the statefof development desired,
for lack of facilities; but special rooms will be fitted up in
the new High school, which will be in keeping with the
State law making manual training compulsory. We shall
then be in position to give proper instructions in that line.

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

We trust the appropriations asked for the coming year

| will not be reduced as we havea great deal of work planned,
including the introduction of kindergartens. This will
call for extra expense on account of special teachers being
needed for the kindergartens, and also for supplies.

In this connection it may be said that the schools of
the city have constant friend in the mayor-elect. The
Committee realize the good work of Dr. Smith, for many
years member of this Board, and judging from his zeal in
promoting the welfare of the schools during that time, feel
that the,needs of the school department will be well cared
for, so far as is in his power. We regret his’ leaving us
after so many years of faithful service, but find consolation
in the fact that in his new sphere his influence for the good
of the schools  really augmented.

By the beginning of another year system of school
banking will be introduced. It has been found to work
very successfully in other cities and we think it will do so
here, as it will have tendency to teach the children thrift
and the value of saving.

The Harvest Festival, which was held for the first
time this year, proved an unqualified success. Many families who were not in position to join in Thanksgiving
dinner were thus given an opportunity to enjoy the season’s good things unsolicited, which otherwise they would
have been unable to do. Aside from the gifts presented
by the children, seasonable exercises were held in the different class rooms, which were appropriately decorated
with harvest emblems, leaving lesson of charity indelibly
impressed upon their minds.

GENTLEMEN— During the months of October, November and December the evening schools were in session
forty nights, as required by law. Notwithstanding it was
the year of the presidential campaign, the enrollment has
been large and the attendance reguiar. The evening
schools, with each sucding year, have been gradually
gaining ground; and as the pupils of other years returned
for this session it was with the evident determination to
do better work than in the past.

The number of teachers, including principals and
clerks, and the enrollment and attendance of pupils, have
been as follows:

Av. Number Average
Teachers. Enrollment. Belonging. Attendance.
Chestnut St. School,  
Hamilton St. School,  
Lyman St. School, II  
Springdale School, 
Total,  

The evening schools, excepting at the Lyman street
building, have been laboring under some very great disadvantages.

  REPORT OF SCHOO], COMMITTEE.

First. Their sessions have been in rooms occupied
by other schools during the daytime. This has been a
matter of serious inconvenience to both schools. ;

second. Because of this fact the furniture has been
of character to discourage the older pupils who come to
the evening schools; full grown men and women have
thus been compelled to attempt to work in seats and at
desks intended for very sinall children.

Third. The lighting is illy adapted to the purpose.

Fourth. The text books are largely the cast-off books
of the primary schools. No difference if he is illiterate, the
pupil in the evening school is of much older age and needs
something besides baby books; he needs books adapted to
evening school purpose.

Fifth. The sessions of forty nights have been
too ,short to systematize the schools. Older pupils—
sometimes men and women—have withdrawn from the
evening schools because they did not like to be classed
with young children.

The Committee have carefully examined the condition
of the evening schools and have realized that the time has
come for extension and improvement of the work. The
Superintendent has also filed the following communication:
To the Committee on Evening Schools:

We have now passed the thirtieth night of our evening schools. Those of little interest and questionable
motive have largely dropped out, but we still have now
belonging, with an attendance of  The majority of
those remaining are young men and young women of little
past opportunity, who are in the evening schools for improvement and increased usefulness. In view of this better interest and also of the fact that we have many
illiterates among the younger workers in our mills, do
not think our schools should close on the fortieth evening
as has been the case in former years; nor do think they
should be closed at any time in the school year when the

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
interest is sufficient to keep open single room. The fact
is, young man ora young woman compelled to leave day
school to make living for others deserves just as much
consideration as any other, and it costs no more to maintain an evening school than day school. However, the
maintenance of evening schools in the buildings used primarily for day schools is matter of very serious inconvenience to the progress of work in the day schools. We.
must find our way to better plan before we can build up
our evening schools as they should be. therefore recommend that the present engagement of teachers and use
of buildings terminate as proposed, in December but that
there be consolidation and reconstruction for continued
work by the following plan:

First. The use of Lyman Street building only; this
building being used for no day school work, and being
equipped very well for evening school purposes.

Second. The enrollment as stndents of to persons from those who have given the greatest evidence of
desire for continued improvement, each student to make
an enrollment deposit, returnable upon attendance given
percentage of nights. Any applications beyond the capacity of the building should be placed on file and honored as
vacancies appear, but in the order of merit.

Third. The selection of principal and assistant
teachers and clerk from those who have rendered the best
service in the present evening schools. teacher to be
allowed for every fifteen or twenty pupils, and to be employed by the night, the force reducible with the size of
the school. The course of instruction shonld be supplemented by special lessons by other instructors.

Fourth. The continuance of school during the school
year as long as the interest demands.

I present this recommendation for consideration, and
trust some plan, this or other, will be devised for keeping
open the evening schools, for am opposed to the closing
of the doors of the school so long as sufficient number of

|
  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
deserving pupils give substantial evidence of their desire
for its continuance.

This experimental test will give us fair measurement of this interest for future purposes. The day is soon
coming when we must have fairly well graded system of
evening schools running parallel with our day schools, and
crowned with an Evening High School or Industrial
Institute. P. W. SEARCH, Supt.

December .

After careful consideration of this communication
and also of the results of the Committee’s visits to the various schools, the following recommendations are made:

First. That the ungraded evening schools, with term
of forty nights, be hereafter continued as in former years.

Second. That an evening grammar school be established for qualified pupils, with trial to be made, beginning with January, at the Lyman street school.

Third. That there be admitted only pupils who
have given evidence of earnest endeavor, and who have
made advancement entitling them to recognition in grammar school work the’admission to be limited, during this
trial year, to the capacity of the Lyman street building,
with place forfeited and given to other application on file,
upon irregularity or unsatisfactory work.

Fourth. That principal and eight assistants be
placed in charge of the school, with appointments made
for such time only as the service of teacher may be warranted by the size of the class.

Fifth. That the course of study be systematized,
suitable text books furnished, and the work in all its parts
be made more attractive for advanced pupils.

Sixth. That two classes under separate teachers be
placed in each room, with consolidation to take place at
the discretion of the Superintendent when the number in
the room falls below twenty, or when the several conditions of the several classes so demand.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  

Seventh. That the school begin January and continue regularly on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday evenings during such months of the school year as the
attendance and character ot the interest may justify.

Your Committee beg to say they have already taken
the necessary steps for the opening of this school. The
Lyman street building has been selected because it is not
occupied by day school service and has froper furniture
and lighting. Two hundred and nineteen applications
have been received from which it is proposed to admit  
of those best qualified, and to place the others on file for
consideration as vacancies occur. The list of teachers has
been decided upon, from which the Superintendent is to
make appointments according to the nature of the
needs. Mr. P. J. Garvey is named as principal. The
salaries are to be the same as already applying to evening
school service. .

The committee also call attention to the fact that
when our city reaches in population, which undoubtedly will be in two or three years, we will be required by state law to maintain an evening high school.
This present step in the establishment of an evening
grammar school, therefore, is in direct line with necessary extension and preparation looking to such expectancy. Respectfully submitted,

REPORT ,OF THE COMMITTEE ON
DRAWING AND WRITING.

Early in the year Mrs. Ferry urged upon the attention
of your Committee the necessity of assistance in her department of drawing. Owing to the great increase in the number of schools in recent years and the increased demand
upon her time in the High school, because of its growth,
it was impossible for her to visit all the schools above first
grade more than once month. She was unable for some
time to visit first grade schools at all, but provided for the
work then by writing the teachers of that grade and giving
specialinstructionstothem. Accordingly your Committee
recommended the employment of an assistant in this department, and authority for so doing was given us in January. Mrs. Rose Dougherty was secured at salary of !
$ and since September has given valuable assistance
in this department, her work having been confined especially to the lower grades, while Mrs. Ferry has charge of
the High school work and the higher grades with general
supervision of the entire work.

- Shortly after the opening of the fall term your Committee considered the advisability of employing an assistant in the department of writing. The teacher here, Miss
MacDonnell, was hard worked and, without doubt, unable
to visit all the schools even so infrequently as once a
month, unless the period of her visit was shortened. While
it seemed as if the infrequency of her visits would demand
more, rather than less, time for each visit, it still seemed

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE. 
inopportune to employ another teacher here, and so your
Committee recommended the shortening of visits, in lower
grades especially, and this enabled us to defer the question of an assistant for this year at least.

It would seem that with the rapid growth of our
schools we must be prepared to add assistants from time to
time in these special branches, if we expect that the work
of teaching them is to be done directly in the school room
by special teachers as heretofore. Would it not be well,
therefore, to consider the advisability of change in these
departments and have the work of direct instruction to
pupils left with the regular teachers, so that our special
teachers would be rather supervisors, only instructing
teachers and generally directing the work through them ?

The work at the Evening Draughting school has been
under the able direction of Mr. T. J. McCarthy, as last
year, and the attendance has been about the same. ‘The
enrollment has been about  with an average attendance
of about  divided, however, into three classes, each
class meeting but once week. Last year the school continued for evenings, and it would seem only proper that
the school be now continued as long as good interest is
maintained, as evidenced by the attendance. In such an
industrial community as ours the advantages of such a
school should be held forth as long as any considerable
numbers are ready to avail themselves of them.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON
MUSIC AND CALISTHENICS. ,
To the Honorable School Committee of the City of Holyoke:
The Committee on Music and Calisthenics respectfully
submit the following report:
CALISTHENICS.
 The method of physical education as taught in our
schools by Professor Eger, shows marked improvement
over the last year.
) We endorse the system as being very successful in developing the muscles, and also in training the children to
proper carriage of the body.
We hope that the equipment of the gymnasium in the
new High school building will afford better opportunity
than we now possess to carry on the work and bring it to a
still higher standard.
MUSIC.
The American System of Music as taught by Professor
Zuchtmann has been very successful the past year.
During the year our schools have been visited by committees from different cities inspecting the system of instruction in music in our schools, having the intention of
introducing the same system into their own schools.
We respectfully recommend that Professor Zuchtmann

, REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
be allotted at least one more day per week for giving instruction. Since his appointment to the position the
schools have increased from to about school rooms
and he still gives but two days’ services each week.

Considering the rapid growth of the schools and in order to do justice to all, we sincerely hope that more time
be allotted him to carry on the work.

During the year an organ was purchased for the Bridge

street building for the sum of .
, Since our last report we have had finished and occupied one of the best equipped and most handsome sixteenroom school buildings in Western Massachusetts—namely,
our West street grammar school.

In order to make its equipment more complete we
would recommend that new piano be placed in the school
hall. Asitis one of the most spacious and commodious
of our school halls, we think it should have an instrument
in keeping with the other arrangements of the building.

INAUGURAL ADDRESS
OF

OUTLINES OF AN IDEAL SCHOOL SYSTEM.
Mr. Chairman, Members of the School Committee, Ladies and
Gentlemen: |
It is with pleasure, indeed, that meet to-night the
school constituency of Holyoke, assembled in gathering of
this character. The public schools come very close to the
homes and hearts of the people, and it is right and proper
that I, at the beginning of my work, should place before
you the cardinal principles of my educational policy.  
desire to take the people into my confidence in all that I
shall attempt to do, to present freely and fully, for public
and private consideration, the live issues involved in my
present and future plans for the development and improvement of your schools, and for the advancement of your
children’s interests.
It may be knownto many of you that have been associated, during the past eight years in particular, with a
work having in view the radical improvement of the public school system. My investigations have been known

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
and my views stated in advance to your school committee,
and appreciate my call to this city of industry and beauty in the Connecticut Valley, where trust we may all do
our part in the unfolding and upbuilding of better system of public instruction. The world has been making
great strides in educational thought. The best thinkers
of the day realize the need of improvement. The rich
contributions of master minds in all ages stand ready for
utilization in practical application. The demand of the
times is living and pronounced for something better than
the old, closely graded system, which has sacrificed so
many individual interests to appearance and mechanical
excellence. So it is that, feeling sure of the ground on
which stand, having conducted line of original investigations leading to certain definite conclusions, come to
Holyoke, expecting to find opportunity to protect and
advance interests far outside of our city itself, believing
that here is place with the proper constituency and progressive spirit for the continued development of work in
which, as Dr. Winship has put it, ‘‘ seventeen millons of
American school children are interested.’ How soon we
may reach any thing distinctive from plans already operative in our schools, do not know.-. The wisest and best
of plans are developed and built slowly. It may take years
before realization is reached; for, after all, it is largely a
question of conditions, in the making of which there is
often need of great deal of preaching of better gospel.

But whatever may be the interest of the outside world
in our presentation of work, there is only one thing that
must characterize this administration, and thatis: ‘‘ What
is best for the Holyoke schools?’’ What responsibility
is involved in the planning for the thousands of children
of city like this! For twenty-five years have stood
under the shadow of the school house, realizing through
days of work, and during many sleepless night, what it.
is to assume the responsibility of giving direction to the
life of even single child. Years ago felt this as teacher

in country school. have recognized it in the graded
school. have realized it as principal of the high school,
of the college preparatory school, of the normal school. I
have felt it as superintendent of the village school, of the
snialler and large city, and its realization does not lessen,
but rather deepens, as experience brings larger knowledge of child life and child potentialities. My friends,
my people, want yourearnest co-operation. must have
your co-operalion, or am but weak, ineffective man,
and my administration will be weakness itself. So it is, I
come to you with an advance statement of my educational
policy; with plain, candid description of what shall
attempt to do; believing that, with an intelligent constituency like this, have nothing to keep in the background,
and that only by such present and future policy can you
be truly my people and vour superintendent of schools.

Therefore, as the best means of explanation of my
educational creed, let me present for your consideration a
discussion, necessarily brief, of the primary elements constituting an Ideal School System.

I—THE CHILD.

The first factor, the all-absorbing element to be considered, is the child—the child for whom alone the school
is maintained, and who hasa right toexpect living returns
for the investment of every fragment of his time and |
energy. To this end there must be adequate provision
for the actual necessities of each and every child—not as
component parts of great central mass, but as individuals. Have the schools of the immediate past been conservative of this great, living principle? They have not.
The trend of practice has been to generalization, particularly in our cities. Gradation! gradation! gradation
has been the cry of school men for thirty years. The result is we have in America magnificent system of public
schools, magnificent in their comely proportions, but hav- .
ing much of their charm in mechanical excellence. adREPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
mit there is beauty in all this and that the closely graded
school looks well on its surface; but what of the child for
whom the school is intended? His highest interests as an
individual have been made to conform to those of the mass.
If he is bright and capable above his fellows, it avails him
little, for his rate of progress must be regulated by the.
average of his class. If he is slow and less capable, he
must drag discouraged at the tail of the class, through difficulties he does not understand, or drop to lower grade,
or more frequently entirely out of school. If heisa big
fellow, having had limited or no opportunity in the past,
he must be graded with children years beneath him, where,
after few days of awkward and discouraged effort he
drops by the wayside, preferring to work in some livery
stable or at some other menial service, above which he
never afterwards can hope to rise. If necessity compels
him to start in school month or more late, he must
go into lower class. If he comes from another 
city or town where the gradation or text books are
different he must lose year or two from his life, all because of lack in possibly one branch of study. He is
pressed as hard on his sick day as on any other; and, if
absent for time because of sickness, he hurries back to
school during his covalescence and weakness to work just
as hard as the strong and vigorous pupils, and doubly so
in order to make up for the lessons he has lost. Have I
been stating an exceptional case? The experience of
school constituencies everywhere will recognize the truth
of the picture drawn. Now understand me; there is
no stronger advocate nor more willing champion than of
the mission of the great public school system for recognize in it the hope of millions and the strength of the Republic; but do mean to say that the characteristics mentioned are elements of weakness and blots upon its
fair name, and are entirely without justification because
absolutely unnecessary. ‘There is an advantage in gradation, but itis different kind of gradation. ‘There is an

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
advantage in centralization, but it is centralization that
has adaptation and conservation. The day is past that
moves all pupils through the same grooves and calls for all
performances of work simultaneouly. It must be henceforth
not the pupil for the school, bvt the school for the pupil. Let
me re-state this keynote which has been cardinal principle in all my educational writings, that somewhere along
the line there must be working place for every child, be his
advancement in qualification what it may. ‘This leads us
then to the greatest educational doctrine of modern times,
and that is /ndtvidualism in Education; not an individualisni scattering to the winds the strength of the school system, as some ignorant critic might misunderstand it, but
an individualism that gathers all the elements and glory
of the entire system around one point of centralization, and
that point  he child, who never appears with so much importance and demand for consideration as when regarded
| as my child. Adjustment, adaptation, flexibility and conservation; these are the elements of strength that must
characterize the new education, so that schools may arise
to their true mission by giving adequate returns to those
who give their all, and by holding on the road to education
that vast multitude who otherwise drop discouraged by the
wayside.

Again, the public schools must, to greater degree, be
conservative of the health of the child. The basis of all
school work should be in careful scientific provision for
physical education, for it concerns both intellectual achievment and moral possibility. ‘‘A sound body for sound
mind’’ is trite saying even truer than it  old. admit
that much has been done by persons of infirm body, but
this is not true of the world’s healthiest thought. Therefore, the proper physical education of children lies distinctly within the province of the public school. Every school
building and school room should be constructed according
to the demands of sanitary science. flood of pure air by
proper means for ventilation, adequate illumination with

REPORT OF SCHOOI, COMMITTEE.  
light at proper angle, and under perfect control, and careful
sewerage are matters of vital importance. Even the sittings :
of the school room must have careful consideration, for it is
folly tothink of accommodating pupils of varied sizes in
desks of uniform dimensions, excepting at loss to physical
health. competent examination of eyesight should be
made from time to time, and proper placing and consideration be given to all of defective vision and defective hearing.
Every exercise of the school should be conductad with referance to the laws of health. It is not sufficient that exercises
should be permissive of health; they must be fundamentally
conducive to proper physical condition as the basis of all
intellectual endeavor. But this important matter will not
take care of itself, nor be effected by purely the ordinary
school provisions. There must be the employment of the
expert director, not merely for little pleasant récreation
in calisthenics, but for live, systematic physlcal training,
that will lay the foundations of vigorous physique which
should be the grace and glory of the future man and woman.
I venture the prediction that the day is not far distant when
the people will recognize the wisdom of employing experts
in order to keep well, instead of the present almost exclusive plan of paying doctors in order to be made well after
good health is lost.

II.—EQUIPMENT.

The equipment of the school is worth more than passing notice. The children must have place to work and
tools for proper performance.

The building should be planned not simply for architectural effect, but more fundamentally for school purposes
and school needs. For lower grade purposes the height
should not exd two stories. Inthe large metropolis the
value of land may force the building of higher buildings,
but the practice of sending little children, and even more
so those in the adolescent period, up and down many flights

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

of stairs is fearfully expensive. The great Stanford University is built entirely: of one story structures—a great
quadrangle within quadrangle, and all surrounded by a
great hollow quadrangle or pavio. While this is ideal and
perhaps impracticable for public school purposes, do
wlsh to emphasize the physiological importance of avoiding
future erection of district school buiddings of more than .
two stories.

The lighting of the school room, the admission, angle
and control of light is question of supreme importance.
Even the color of the walls, the arrangement of windows,

 the position of black board, the slant of desk lid, the avoidance of glossy paper, and the accommodation of defective
oO children, demand careful consideration. It perhaps costs
more at first to properly erect and equip building for the
conservative of the eye, but good school equipment is

nitely cheaper than spectacles in the long run.

I am glad am to work in state where so much
is being done by the state law to give the children an abun| dance of pure air. The magnificient system in operation
in the schools ought to be as object lesson for the reconstruction of our homes, and needs no discussion at this time.
I cannot pass this subject of school buildings without
commending the two magnificient school buildings you are
now erecting. These should add to the pride of the city,
and will no doubt set the standard at which all subsequent
buildings will be erected.

But whatever building may be in operation, or future
extension be made, it should be borne distinctly in mind
that other equipment is necessary. It takes more than
brick and mortar to make school. workshop needs
working material. Children have been driven to books,
books, books, and to certain extent to impractical and
unnatural education because the average community supplies no other mental food. It often happens when building is being done that so much is spent on the outside
that the community feels poor for equipment within. This

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
should not be the case, for the most expensive thing used in
connection with the school ts the child’s time, and child’s time
zs worth as much asa man’s time. The community should
see to it that there is proper provision in this particular. I
trust will already find your schools equipped for efficient
work. III—COURSES OF STUDY.

Let us now consider the course of study. What isthe
primary end of all education Simply one thing, and that
is, as Herbert Spencer has expressed it, ‘‘To store up power.’’ That being the case, the best educative medium is
that which best develops within the person the power of
thought, of determination, of action.

What is the book worm who continues to absorb but
never gives out? What is the first-honor man whose sun 
sets on commencement night? What is the man who
knows everything but does nothing The man of education should pre-eminently bea man of action. Not merely to
learn, but to think and to act must be the keynote of the
student's purpose. Not what he has been trained to do,
but what he cando will determine his success in life. The
world needs men of thought, men of power, men of action;
yea, rather men with the three elements combined in one.
Such class of men and women should be the product of
every school; and the world with its living demands and
progressive action will be satisfied with nothing less.

This brings us face to face with the importance of a
continuous line of industrial education. Theold policy of
schools has been to seek results by the assignment of the
more abstract tasks, accomplished frequently with imperfect insight and understanding, and hence with meagre
contributing value. The new education demands economy of time by planning work from the start for the more
rapid development of the active, self-reliant, trained
worker, realizing that with greater power and the more

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
ready command of the working faculties there are increased opportunities for achievement all along the line.

I regret to find that in the city of Holyoke no steps
have been already taken toward the establishment of kindergarten instruction. What world of possibilities may
be opened up by proper utilization of the activities of the
child’s earlier years by methods that will expand his being and enrich his entire after life. became an advocate
of the kindergarten years ago, before public appreciation
in this country had recognized its importance and contributing value. have livedin the company and atmos—
phere of the kindergarten for twelve years, and have had
as many as fifty kindergarten teachers at work ata time.
I therefore know by extended experience the truth of my
statement when say that the kindergarten pupil is a
better worker in every sense of the word than the one
schooled without such help. He has been trained to see
and to express; he is in better command of his working
faculties he  able to accomplish with less expenditure
of time and energy, and in every way he works to better
results. Hence, trust the day will early come when
there may be the precedence of this important department
of work to your already efficient schools, for we must soon
come to recognize that little childis worth as much asan
older one.

But shall the individual education of the children end
with the kindergarten? No! there must be utilization al]
along the line, purely for economy’s sake. There is not a
single argument for the kindergarten, save one, that does

| not apply with equal force to sloyd in all the other grades
and to manual training inthe high school. This matter
. is not mere theory with me. know by actual experience what manual training does for the boy and for the
girl. It gives him the keen observant eye, the ready
hand and the strengthened mind. It bases his experience
and intelligence upon actuality and truth, and not upon
abstraction and definition. It gives him respect for the

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
nobility of toil, elevates his moral standard, cultivates his
judgment and critical power, develops his creative faculty
and inventive genius, and gives him power as selfreliant trained worker, not equally possible from the other ‘
departments of school work. The old criticism that it
takes from the other studies is the criticism of one who
knows nothing by experience of true manual training, or
has judged it by an exceptional case. It saves time and
enriches the other departments of work. Given’ two
average students both preparing for the classical course
at the college, and will makea better and more creditable
student, in the same time, out of the one who has carried
his manual training in connection with other studies, than
of the one who has had all book education without manual
training asa superior aid. This does not in the least disparage the older subjects of study, but it does emphasize
the importance of additional culture along lines of creative
faculty not adequately comprehended in the policy of most
schools. |

But the industrial education must concern more than
the purely disciplinary elements of study; it must bring
the school life in contact with the demands of practical life,
using each for the other’s purpose. To that end then
should be the supplementary department of domestic economy for girls. There should also be sewing in the lower.
grades, as carefully prepared, systematic and well directed
as the course in drawing; and there should also be the
cooking school, with its higher contributing value. venture the assertion that there is no one place where modern
science has made so little advance asin our kitchens. We
cook, we eat, we drink, with no knowledge of the elements
contained in foods, no realization of the chemical change
effected by heat, solution or mixture, and with no scientific appreciation of the essential elements we are to get
out of food by eating. We feed the little child and the old
person at the same table and on the same food; the sick
and the well; the brain worker and the one of physical

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

toil. Many gormandizer dies before his time because he
is starved to death; many brain worker breaks down
from nervous exhaustion because he is not properly fed ;
many man is bad man morally because of indigestion.
Tradition! tradition regulates everything, and we pause
not to ask the scientific question, Why? The factis, character is often better made in the kitchen than in the Sunday
school. Oh, if people knew how to be strong, and would
take the necessary steps to be strong, what world this
would be in intellectual and moral achievement! Therefore, hold that the cooking school has its legitimate place
in the public school, the same as any other department of
chemistry. What folly there is in confining all school
chemistry to the manipulation of drugs and poisonous chemicals, to the exclusion of the cooking laboratory and processes which offer so much better opportunity for the study
of true chemistry, combining every advantage of disciplinary value with such magnificent practical results.

This brings us naturally and directly to the consideration of science study. There is no field which opens up
so many avenues of healthy mental activities as science.
This is nature’s gymnasium for mental growth, the first
into which the child is born. Have you ever noticed how
the little one’s mind early runs out to the great outer
world; how he would place under tribute all the natural
sciences for his personal investigation? Howdoes itcome
that this department which is the mort natural, the most
productive and the ever-ready one for the development of
the child’s mind is the one we use least and is, in fact, the
most difficult of all to properly introduce in our schools.
Soon we shut the child’s vision to all glimpses of the outer
world. We narrow his attention to the printed page and
fill him with unnatural exercise. Have you ever paused
to consider how little is actually accomplished in the average primary school; how much time is consumed in learning very few very little things? Oh, let us open the
doors to the sunshine and inspiration of the great world of

REPORT OF SCHOOI COMMITTEE.  
nature and give the child mind something to do, something to feed on. |

But there is great deal of so-called science in
schools that is almost an utter waste of time. Oral
instruction and information cram are the banes of the
educational field. When shall we lever that no study
can be called science study, unless every result obtains
by the child’s own observation and patient investigation.
To direct, to lead to endeavor and accomplishment, is the
teacher’s province. Every exercise must be made the
child’s own, every result assimilated into his very being.
This would enrich his work, strengthen his faculties and
fill him with conscious, glowing enthusiasm that is the
secret of all great success in intellectual endeavor.

This then is the basic grounding of all education.
The child must first gain his experiences from the great
realm of nature. He must be taught to observe, and to
arrive at conclusions by personal investigations. He
must be trained to command himself, to be self-reliant,
independent worker, to be not an imitator but creator in
the various realms he touches. Once given the subject
matter absolutely his own, expression in language form is
the direct consequence. Creative intelligence always finds
a language of its own. |

But what of the three R’s and the kindred branches,
and the culture studies that have so long been regarded
as the fundamentals in school work. have not time now
to discuss these important branches, excepting to say that
no man recognizes their intrinsic value more than do I.
I would emphasize and re-emphasize their importance; but
at the same time, do not hesitate to say there is an
immense amount of valuable time frequently wasted in
these studies upon exercises having comparatively little
value. If person by few months of time at private
writing school can become beautiful penman, why should
the public schools require eight or ten years to produce perhaps lessresults. Ifthe boy educated in the country school

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

can become proficient in arithmetic in few, short winters
of school work, who shall justify the immense consumption of time required in the so-called graded courses. There *
must be greater economy of time and of requirement.
The valueless must be eliminated from our curricula. The
children must be given live, vigorous exercise, with something to do, and with less dissipation of energy upon
wishy-washy exercises, and unprofitable reviews. We are
told by both President Eliot and President Harper that
the average boy in Germany is two years farther along
than the average boy of the same age in America. This
should not be. There must be elimination of waste in the
lower grade schools. The courses of study must be
enriched by opportunity to begin more productive studies
earlier. If the public schools are to prepare their students
for the college, how can boy gain college education
when he cannot graduate from the high school before the
age of or  demand of the lower grade schools:
first, that the pupils be better prepared, and second, that
they reach the high school at an earlier age.

The high school has two distinct missions: First, it
must give adequate preparation to those who go on to college. To that end its courses of study must be in line
with the various college and university types, so that
whenever student finds it possible to go on to college, he
nay find himself on the right road, prepared to qulaity
without loss to himself. The high school that does not
give trend and impulse toward higher education is poor
high school indeed. Its value as an instruction of merit
may be recognized in time by the number of candidates, it
nominates to the college and the university.

But the high school has second and greater mission, and that is as finishing school for those who cannot
go onto higher education. Of this great majority, sight
should never be lost. Happily, however, with the differentiation of courses now characterizing many high
schools, it is not so difficult to provide for these two

—

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  I
classes. As arule, the study which best prepares for the
college is also best for the finishing school; but along the
details of this line all persons do not think alike.

It may be difficult in asmall high schooi to provide
for all wants, but in high school such as the Holyoke
High school will have opportunity to be in short time, on
entrance to our new building, where there must, of necessity, be many teachers and many working sections, certainly there ought to be options enough to provide for
all reasonable demands.

In addition to the two distinct missions or provinces of
the high school which have more or less general acceptance, think may safely say we are rapidly approaching
a day when the high school must take on third department ot work, and that is to furnish extension courses of
study for popular instruction. Organized, as high school
should be, with large number of cultured, expert specialists, its strength ought to be utilized for the lifting up of
the community outside of the school proper. It should indeed be the ‘‘peuple’s college’’ and as such extend its instructions by special lectures and courses of study to elements generally unrecognized and undeveloped in the community.

In connection with the regular courses of study in the
schools, lower and high, there should also be, for the regular pupils, certain lines of collateral opportunity. First,
there should be an encouraged line of inventive and constructive exercises, and of scientific investigations to be performed at home, but not under requirement. Second, the
schools should direct the voluntary literary work of the
pupils. Children are going to read, their reading consti- .
tutes prominent part of their education, and it is almost
criminal to let them waste their energies and time in desultory reading of trash, when so much might be accomplished
under systematic and competent direction. Consequently, the schools should prepare course of suggested readings, for the performance of which due credit should be
given.

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

Third, the schools must teach thrift, economy and svstematic savings as cardinal factors in the making of character. That being the case, the establishment of school sav--»
ings banks, with weekly opportunity for deposits, in every
school room and with care of and responsibility for the
funds at one of the established savings banks of the city, is
distinctly within the province of the public schools. have
had several years of experience with school savings banks
and have nothing to report excepting the most satisfactory
results. have never known but two cases of complaints:
one from the vendors of chewing gum and cheap candies;
and the other from family where boy stole his father’s
books and sold them at the pawnbroker’s in order to get
money for his banking account. This was case where
the boy’s thrift was better than his morals.

METHODS OF WORK.

This is the ‘day of progressive educational thought,
which calls for greater economy all along the line. This
brings us to the consideration of methods of work.

 Hours of Study.—The average school calls for too
many hours of work from the growing child. No one expects man to work all day and then through several hours
of the evening. Why then should we expect greater protraction of effort upon the part of the immature child?
Scientific investigation has determined much concerning
normal periods of work. There is no educative value in
an exercise beyond certain point of constrained attention.
Exhausted brain may produce something, but that some thing is creation of weakness, and the process has reacted

, in reflex weakness to the brain itself. It is not quantity
that educates. It is not long protracted effort that makes
a student strong, but the healthy activity of unclouded

brain, working through normal hours and by natural processes. Again, the school has no right to appropriate to

itself the entire time of the child. The student needs time

for rest and recreation, for duties that belong to the home,

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
the church, and social life. The school can accomplish all
desired results with proper confinement of working hours,
and much better results will obtain when the work glows
with the vigor and capability of glorious good health.

 Laboratory Methods.—One of the most expensive
elements of the school is the recitation hour as ordinarily
practiced. The recitation was originally intended for a
good purpose; but it now constitutes, in most schools, the
greater exercise of the day, and is appropriated almost entirely for the teacher’s purpose. In consequence, the poor
child is crowded to outside hours for the preparation of his
lesson. The recitation must give way to the laboratory
method, by which the student may pass nearly his entire
time in continuous advance work. This utilizes every moment of the day, there is no passive waiting for turn in
recitation, and the time gained enables the work to be accomplished without the usual demand for long outside
hours of study.

 Pupils must be taught to work from proper motive.
The per cent., the grading and ranking of pupils, the recognition of bright pupils by special honors, and all such
incentives are false to the true spirit of education and
should have no place in the school. Pupils should be
taught to work for pure love for work. The doctrine of
Interest is fundamentally right. When pupils are so
taught to do work the school room takes on new character and atmosphere, there is glow of enthusiasm and conscious pride that does not obtain by the old selfish, sordid
method. There is an impulse and uplift given to the
student’s life that places him on higher plane and finds
expression in an ethical development, which, after all, is
the true, the great end of education.

) V—THE TEACHER.

Next to the child, for whom the school is intended,
stands the teacher as great factor in the making of an
ideal school. What a.responsibility is assumed. by those

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
who undertake to train mind and to give character to the
children of the republic. To make mistake frequently
means the loss of years to the child; to misunderstand him
may turn the entire current of immortal life. The community should insist upon it that none but the more capable are employed for this important work; not school keepers, but school teachers who have within themselves the
elements of enobling life, and who have the other qualifications requisite for the responsibilities they incur. The
teacher should be person of broad general education, of
adequate specific training, of progressive professional
spirit, indefatigable energy, consecration of purpose, and
with breast filled with the milk of human kindness. Ina
nutshell, there are three great requisites which should be
possessed by every teacher; good health, mind prepared
for the work of teaching, and great, big heart that takes
the pupil all in.

But where shall adequate supply of such teachers be
found. My friends, that is perplexing problem. The
schools of America are growing so rapidly that the professional supply is not keeping pace with the demand.
Another difficulty is the lack of permanency in thc teaching force. In this country workers retire from the
school room every year, and another come in.
Under such circumstances school system can not be ideal;
but, with judicious selection, much can be done to improve its quality. With first preference givento home candidates, the entire country should be placed under tribute in selection of the best teachers; and, when found,
such workers should be appreciated and held to the school
by proper remunerative salaries.

the boy at the foot of the class went to the head; and tonight as look back over the numberless circumstances
that go to make up life, that one incident stands out
vivid and distinct as great turning point in my life, and
I verily believe that whatever success have since had is
all owing to the uplift and impulse given me at the hands
of that faithful grammar grade teacher. ;

Such teacher was the great Arnold of Rugby. How
many an Englishman can rise up to call his name blessed,
and yet the influence of such life permeates thousand
places where it is not recognized and moulds the character
of thousand schools. Arnold it was who brought heart
into the schools of England, and recognized there is more
between the lines of school life than on its surface. We
are all too prone to forget the incidental in our own work,
which after all is the greatest part. We become often
times so immersed in the details of this or that study that
we overlook the boy or girl who stands by our side, hungry
for something better. Pardon me if give you another incident from my life as student. wasinthe high school,

that was permitted to work in the superintendent’s room
as an advanced student. But to me all work was largely
task work in which had no definite purpose—no great
objective. One daya stranger visited the school. The

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
dismissal of the schools for recess called the superintendent tothe hall. The door closed, and the stranger and
the boy were alone. Sauntering down to my end of the
long dark room, he stood looking over my shoulder.
‘‘What are you doing my boy?’’ inquired his kindly voice.
‘‘Oh am studying my Latin’’ said I. ‘‘What are you
doing that for?’’ What was doing that for: the thought
had never occured to me. had been doing the work because it had been placed before me, but any great purpose
involved in it had never come home tome. ‘‘Are you going
to college?’’ ‘‘No sir,’’ said I. ‘‘Why not?’’ persisted the
stranger. ‘‘I ama poor boy, have no money, can’t go to
college.’’ ‘‘Did it ever occur to you,’’ said he, ‘‘that money
is not necessity for going to college?’’ What strange doctrine was this? told himI thought it was. Just then the
bell rang: there was the hurrying of feet through the hall,
and it was apparent we were about to be interrupted. The
gentleman put his hand on my shoulder and said: ‘‘My
boy am passing stranger. may never see you again
and you may never see me; but want you to remember the
advice of passing stranger. It is this: Fix certain day
ahead, far or near, when you will go to college; and when
that day comes, go. If you have money, go; if you have
not, go anyway. If you can ride on the railway train, ride;
if you cannot, walk; but go tocollege. Heturned and left

after that day; but he had planted seed in my life. He
had given purpose to my education. That man was James
A. Garfield. do not know to whatextent his advice
shaped my subsequent career; we never can measure such
influence; but this do know, fixed certain day ahead
and when that day came was penniless; but went to
college. 
Oh, teacher, have you never given purpose or inspiration to the life of girl or boy? Then you know nothing
of the joy that belongs to the true teacher. To be a
teacher; what an infinite privilige. But have known

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
some in the work who did not wish to be known by that
name. To such would say: Go study the life of the
great Agassiz, the greatest of all American educators, who
asked that his long life of usefulness and fame might be |
crowned by this simple inscription: ‘‘Louis Agassiz—
Teacher.’’ He who had won the plaudits of all the world ‘
‘had no higher ambition than to be known by that name;
and well should you and appreciate the glory it confers
upon us.

VI—THE SUPERINTENDENT. The superintendent should be the leader of his schools
and factor in everything that is best in his community. He should be man of education, of experience,
of fitness and of character. In him there should be
an innate love for children and he should be the best
friend his teachers have. He should be man of
professional standing and have opportunity to take his
place, as the representative of his community, in the
highest educational circles and councils of the entire
nation. He should be man in full control of his
schools, unhampered in the execution of his policy,
able to meet an emergency or correct weakness when
it appears; but he should be held strictly responsible
for results. In his relations to the Board of Education he
should be their adviser, and -his recommendations should
be respected as from the man who has every opportunity
to know the trend of educational thought and the needs of
his schools. He should be student of his communities
interests; and while he should make his claims for adequate financial provision, itis his duty to practice the most
careful economy and ever to keep expenditures within
available resources.

In assuming the duties of superintendent there are two
things wish to say :

First. shall expect opportunity to place my schools
among the best schools of the nation. have generous

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
acquaintance with the best schoolsofthe day. know something of the pastand current educational thought. Ihavea
definite knowledge of what want to do; and now shall
expect full control of my schools and the earnest co-operation of all concerned. If find in this community what I

: expect, the best energies of my life will be given to the upbuilding of aschool system of the truesteconomyand, trust, ”
to the honor of HolyoKe; but whenever the day comes in
which will be crippled inthe execution of live, vigorous
and progressive policy, that day will bring the early severance of my connection with the schools. There is something which superintendent wants more than money, and
that is opportunity, without wich he isa mere figurehead
in his schools. .

‘Second. come to Holyoke purely as man and an
educator. know nothing by participation of the practices
of the politician, and do not propose, to acquaint myself
now. My work will be with my schools. If have anything to say it will be said in plain, straightforward
manner; but have no time to spend in shading the color
of politician, or in participation, excepting asa citizen,

-  inelections. That part leave entirely to the people. I
come here as an educator, shall do my work as an
educator, and expect the people to take care of me as an
educator. It may be this is not the best policy, but it will
be my practice. Whenever the day comes on which I
cannot stand without taking my office into politics, then on
that day want to fall.

VII.—THE BOARD OF EDUCATION.

The board of education, or school committee, should
be made up of men representing the business brains, the
intellectual fibre, and the character of the community.
Their duties are full of great responsibility. They should
represent the people and be the conservative balance
of the schools. As the superintendent advises them,

, so should they also council him. They should assist him

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
in the execution of his policy and find ways and means for
all necessary execution. Hand in hand, and shoulder to
shoulder, working for the best interests of the schools, the
school committee and the superintendent represent two departments in school control—the legislative and the executive. These two provinces should be separate and distinct.

' Each should be the adviser of the other, but no high development of schools can obtain where one infringes upon
the other. The one should be distinctively legislative, the
other executive; but both should be co-ordinated and correlated. wonder if the people have any idea of the burden of work carried and the sacrifices made by the members of school committee. They are the only ones of
all the working force who serve without compensation.
Their duties call for the most generous sacrifice of personal
time and the carrying of burden of work and responsibility entirely undesirable. In return for this they are compelled, in the performance of conscientious duty, to make
many community enemies, to receive the criticism and
sometimes abuse of all who do not think the same way as
themselves; and in time, without appreciation and without
compensation, are returned to private life to find their business sacrificed by the public whom they sought to serve.
Surely this ought not to be the reward of the faithful public servant. hope it is not in the city of Holyoke.
VIII.—THE COMMUNITY.

The last factor to be considered in the making of an

 ideal school is the community—the people. Noschool can
ever rise much higher than the constituency of its people.
There should be the warmest appreciation by the people of
all good efforts of the teachers, the superintendent and the
school committee. The public schoois should be made so
good that they will merit the pride and approbation of the
people, but there is reflex influence. The city of Denver
owes the reputation of its far-famed schools to one thing,

‘and that is pride of the people. There are cities in the

go REPORT OF SCHOOL, COMMITTER.

United States where the visitor is at once taken to the
grave yard to view the stately monuments and relics of departed greatness, but in Denver the stranger is driven to
the public school buildings as the one great attraction of
the city. Asa result of this one thing the schools of Denver have arisen to the magnificent plane accorded them.
There is every thing to commend this feature of public
policy. May we not hope for this happy condition of
affairs in the city of Holyoke?

But there should be something more than sentiment
and policy in determining the public estimation of schools.
There should be the most intimate relations between the
home and the school. Nothing will so make school as
the frequent presence of patrons in the school itself. It
encourages the children, elevates the work of the teachers
and leads to that happy union of sympathy which should
characterize mutual interest. few years ago it was my
privilege to labor in city where the people loved to be in
the midst of school work, and hope to find the same
goodly practice here.

But even the home necessarily removed from the school,
should be in the more earnest sympathy with the school
itself. The parent has right to suggest and ask that
which is best for his child, and such requests should always
be given the most careful consideration. Both teacher and
superintendent should do everything they can, consistently,
to make accommodations of this kind. On the other hand,
the parent owes great deal to the school; and nothing
can ever more permanently enhance the opportunity of
the child than an atmosphere in the home of the kindliest
support of and co-operation withthe teacher. Both parent

: and teacher are working for one great end, and that is, the
best culture of the child.

But because of the nature of conditions school cannot
be ideal. great many things will go wrong, and the
work will fréquently be misunderstood. May not ask
the people of Holyoke to come at once to the school room

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE. gI
when anything is at fault. assure you the office of
superintendent, as well as of all the subordinate officers,
will be only too glad to see you when you feel there has
been injustice, or is reason for improvement. We are all
working for one thing, and that is the higher good of your
child. am quite sure we can do more with earnest co-operation than we can when we misunderstand each other.

IN CONCLUSION.

| Allow me to say thank you for the generous welcome and expression given by your presence tonight. I
have attempted in this discussion to present something of
my ideals. beg you to remember am wholly unacquainted with this field, and in consequence may have said
something which may be misunderstood. At no future
time can hope to talk as unembarrassed in this particular
as tonight. The criticisms have made apply to school
systems in general, and there has been nothing in my remarks prompted by knowledge of local conditions.

Neither would this night forget the worthy man 

whose successor Iam. Doubtless the chair am to fill has
been filled by an able man. The schools which am to
| superintend have been built up by one whose heart was in
the work and whose best life has been given to the development of their interests. With the many many friends
who have known his work wish to place my tribute of
honor in his old-time place, and say: ‘‘Here worked man
who loved his schools.’’ The work he has done will continue. There will be no tearing down: Ican begin where he
left off. The fact that have presented some characteristic ideals means no disparagement tothe past. Doubtless
good work has been done here. However, the best of
schools can be improved, as mine can also be when leave
them at some future time. But we are in wonderfully
progressive age, anc the problems of this year will not be
the problems of last year. We are just beginning to
scientifically study the child, and each additional year

brings its additional argument for adaptation to living
necessities. In the past have had opportunity for extended original investigations, supplemented by rich
observation of schools. feel ready for entrance upon the
problems of the future.

How soon will be able to realize my ideals in giving
you such school system as have outlined, do not
know. It may be long time; it may take years; for we
must first prepare the way. school is largely the creation of conditions, and ideal conditions must precede an
ideal school organization. Again, while ama man of
convictions and positive views, which have candidly and
unreservedly stated before you, am conservative in the
changes which are to bring the execution of my full policy.
I beg you to be patient. We must work slowly to accomplish surely. Let us all work together for the upbuilding
of your school and mine.

And now, good people, thanking you and the School
Committee for the honor you have conferred in my call to

' your leadership in educational matters, realizing the magnitude of the work and the responsibility intrusted to my
care, do consecrate myself, with God’s help, to the development of your city’s highest interests, to the work of
giving you system of schools that will merit your pride
and commendation—and to this work, with the children
and for the children, invite your earnest, your heartfelt,
and your prayerful co-operation.

THE SUPERINTENDENT’S REPORT.
To the School Committee of the City of Holyoke This report, coming as it does, almost at the beginning
of my administration, is too early to be comprehensive as a
review of the work attempted, and hence must necessarily
be brief. The Superintendent’s report, in city of this
size, should show, more or less in detail, the condition of
his schools, the general specifications of plans placed in operation and the progress of the work. To this should be
added series of recommendations for the guidance of the
consideration of the School Committee, the Board of Public Works, other related city officers and for the approval
of the people. There might also well be given resume
of the characteristic features of highly successful work in
other first-class schools. The report should be, first of all,
for the people, to whom the schools belong, and who are
always more interested in information concerning the
actual plans of the schools than is usually thought. It
pays to keep the people intimately acquainted with what
we are trying to do. Poor schools are always expensive,
and merit condenination and the witholding of liberal support; but, given the opportunity to intimately co-operate
in upbuilding, there is no other department of municipal
government that appeals so strongly to the interests of the
people, and none that will meet so generous maintenance. For this reason, have asked that my inaugural
| address, given at the community reception accorded me on

O  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

my taking charge of your schools, should be published in

this report; for desire that the people should have a
clear and definite idea of the trend of the Superintendent's |
purpose.

To attain to these ideals means the upbuilding of a
school system that will do much toward the reconstruction
of the public school policy of America. Standing, as I
attempt to do, for the greater conservation of the individual in mass education, have been gratified indeed by the
noble advance support given me by the School Coimmittee
and by the people of Holyoke. An election as Superintendent, last August, by bare majority of one, has since
been made unanimous by the earnest co-operation and endorsement of nine members out of nine. The recent change
in the rules, placing the nomination of teachers in the
hands of the Superintendent, is an expression of confidence
deeply appreciated. The principals and teachers have
been deeply interested in the work suggested to them ;
my fellow officers of the city have been co-operative the
press has been very generous indeed in its support and
presentation while from the community have come many
positive assurances of appreciation and helpfulness in the
work of advancement of our schools for the greater enrichment of child-life. With so much of cordial and royal support there is no reason why our schools should not rise to
a high position in American education. certainly am
deeply and profoundly grateful for the noble opportunity
placed before me by generous and appreciative people.

Even with this appropriation the most careful economy will be necessary to meet all the positive demands of
the year. recommend that the annual appropriation be
carefully apportioned to the several departments of school
expenditure, and that nothing but the most urgent necessity permit transfer from one department to another.
With the beginning of my first fiscal year as Superintendent, new series of books will be opened for the keeping of the financial records of the school departments. The
expenditures will be classified more closely and the books
kept in such manner as will show the itemized costs of the
individual buildings, and also of the several departments
of study. The monthly balance sheets will present the
exact condition of each department account, and give the
various committees definite information concerning the
availability for future expenditures. The books and accounts of the school department should be kept in thoroughly business-like manner, to which the greatest obstacle in the past has been insufficient office force.

West Holyoke,  
Ingleside,  
Lyman street, Evening school

The overflow pupils in the High school are carried by
using the hall, the attics, foul room in the basement,
and one outside rented room, for class purposes. In the
Appleton street school two schools work in the hall, with
no dividing partition. In the South Chestnut street
school three rooms of questionable sanitation have been
constructed in the attic and one room is rented outside.
In the spring another rented room will doubtless be needed.
The accommodation in the Elmwood school include
  in the old building. ‘The Hamilton street school is accommodated by one outside room. At the Park street
school the present accommodations are not as reported;
because the building is at present used for the work of the

city Training school. Sargeant street school has one small
outside room. ‘The North Chestnut is reported as having
  accommodations, but some of the rooms are not large
enough for pupils. At the Nonotuck school two additional rooms have been made by dividing the school hall,
and in addition five rooms are rented in adjacent stores
and tenements. The Ewingville school is not in condition
for any school use whatever. At Springdale one school
works in the engine house with the hose cart in the same :
 room.

A quotation of the accommodations in building is
generally misleading, for it seldom so occurs that grade assignments can be so made as to fully fill all rooms. For
the same reason no footings are given to the columns showing the accommodations and enrollment for the entire city,
for the buildings are not so placed as to permit one relieving another.

In view of the showings of the above table it is evident
something must be speedily done to relieve the congestion.

is still growing and needs are multiplying upon us. The
Appleton street school will be relieved by the conversion
of the Elm street school into grammar school; and possibly Nonotuck school to some extent, but not materially
so unless the Ewingville school can be placed in sanitary
condition. No doubt we will be forced to open some lower
grade rooms in the new High school building, which will
help South Chestnut. Park street school next year may
relieve Hamilton. But all this is insufficient. We must

“ With schools growing so rapidly as ours, it will be a
very difficult matter to properly care for the large expected
increase. To meet this, in part, it might be well to adopt
the single session plan in our first primary grades, the day’s
session for such schools, morning and afternoon, being
three hours. This would gain, possibly, ten rooms for
immediate service. As matter of fact, three hours of
school work per day is enough for child five years old.
It is mistake to think the results are materially increased
‘by doubling the session. child needs time for play and
out door life. Beyond that, there is limit to possibility
in school training, and that limit is passed within the three
hours. The half session plan in the primary school adds
‘greatly to the enrichment of such school by the opportunity offered the teacher to visit and observe other schoolsin

- But the plan has its disadvantages, Many children
need to be with the teacher for general purposes of culture.
‘They need to be lifted above the environments of the home

pay be. The teacher who concentrates the children’s other wise scattered work into single session uses up her energy
- that much faster. She will do better work in the single
session but, if forced to carry another school in the afternoon, she will be able to give the little ones of the later
session instruction very poor indeed. .

The question of half day sessions in the primary
schools, then, has its two economic sides, which both deserve careful consideration.

KINDERGARTENS.

I recommend that kindergartens be established, beginning with September, in different parts of the city as
building accommodations may permit. Unfortunately, we
will find efforts in this direction very much limited by inadequate room; but we should make beginning by opening at least one kindergarten in each of the general
districts at the time specified. An extended acquaintance’
with the active operations of kindergarten instruction and
a careful observation of results lead me to recommend and
most earnestly hope that no further time be lost in giving
to the children of Holyoke this fundamental opportunity
for better school life.

But in the establishment of our kindergartens there is
one thing we cannot too well appreciate, and that  s, there
is no place in all the schools where educated and trained
teachers are more required. Many cities have brought
failure to themselves and discredit to kindergarten instruction by the low ideals with which they have begun the
work. young lady may in short time gather few
fancy acquirements in weaving, paper folding and games,
and appear in the role of kindergartner; but this cannot

- pass as the work of the kindergarten. The kindergartner
must have broad scholarship; knowledge of nature and
of children; heart full of music, finding expression
through hands, voice and life; and psychological and
specific professional training. ‘To whatever extent we can

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE. IOI
inaugurate kindergartens it will pay us to attempt no
more than we can do well, using our first yeat’s experiences
for enlargement and extension as opportunity may present

. itself. The rule, recently adopted, defining the eligibility
of kindergarten teachers will be found wise one: ‘‘Candidates for appointment as teachers in the kindergartens
must present equivalence of high school graduation, and
also two years’ successful training in some reputable kin dergarten normal.”’
MANUAL TRAINING.

On the  th day of June,  the Legislature passed
anact providing that after the first day of September,  ,
every city of twenty thousand or more inhabitants shall
maintain, as part of its high school system, the teaching
of manual training, the course to be pursued in such instruction to be subject to the approval of the State Board
of Education. By special favor the law has not been enforced against Holyoke, because we have been in the
midst of erecting new high school building; but such
favor cannot be extended beyond the close of this school
year, nor do we wish it to be. Therefore, plans are already being formulated looking to the equipment of a
manual training department in the new high school at a
cost of such department to be in operation from the
opening of the building. This will make very creditable
beginning, and, in this particular, will place Holyoke in
the front rank of other Massachusetts cities.

Great credit, however,  due the Hamilton Street
school for having carried on, at meagre cost to the city,
a systematic course in sloyd instruction, which has added
greatly to the effectiveness of educational effort and also to
the school interest of the pupils. Our principals and
teachers are interested in carrying the work in this inexpensive way into other schools, for which opportunity will
doubtless be given next year. With the coming of trained
teachers to the conduct of the manual training work in

 .. .. .REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE, .,,, :.,.
the high school, it will be possible to give direction to this
work in the other grades in very helpful ways.
THE NEW HIGH SCHOOL. ee
 “It is greatly to be hoped that our high school will
be able to enter its new building in September. When the
building is completed, at its cost of few places in
the country will be able to point to working place more
commanding in position, more magnificent in proportions,
and more effective in interior arrangements. What new
era this building should open up for our city. The high
school will then expand itself into good work, not equally
possible inthe past because of unfortunate building limitations. The courses of study will be rearranged and reconstructed; the work will be enriched by modern
laboratory methods; departments in touch with the practical demands of life will be added, and the culture studies
improved by nobler opportunity. How much this will
mean can be but faintly appreciated at the present time.
In addition to the enrichment of our high school
proper, this magnificent building should be the center of
the community’sculture. Extension courses of study will
be formed for the benefit of older persons who desire to be
directed in systematic work in literature, art, science and
industry popular lectures of high educational value will
be presented, and festivals of music and exhibitions of art
fostered. With the teachers necessary to direct the work
 of the high school in the new building, there is no reason
why the community, with judicious selection, but with
little expense, should not ingraft upon itself many of the
higher excellencies of Drexel, Pratt and Adler institutes. !
Such grasping and utilization of opportunity would lift |
Holyoke to position of culture occupied by few cities.
Our high school must be ‘he people’s college.’’ This
calls,not for more money, but for strong plan and opportunity for its execution. feel that the school committee
and the community are ready to help in its development.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
SPECIAL RECOMMENDATION.

I deem it duty to call attention to the great amount
of stair climbing necessary in building so large as the
new high school will be. Practically four floors will be
occupied; for the basement, containing gymnasium, lunch
rooms, manual training rooms and bicycle rooms, certainly
must count as floor of full demands in this particular.
If person should enter the building and merely make a
single circuit of the halls, without entering the rooms, he
would travel, in so doing, feet and pass over steps
of stairs.

In high school, the periods of work are usually six
in number, the pupils changing to other departments at
end of each period. This is necessary, for the work is departmental and each room has its specific equipment. The
extremes of the science, art and commercial rooms on the
third floor, and the manual training, gymnasium and lunch
rooms in the basement, will illustrate something of the very
great demands that will be made upon the pupils.  For instance, an average pupil, starting from the entrance, might
be said to go first to assigned room on second floor, traveling in so doing feet of floor space and climbing one flight
of stairs; then to auditorium for opening exercises, feet
and one flight; to Latin room, perhaps on second floor; to
science laboratory, feet and two flights; to gymnasium,
  feet and three flights; to literature or history room,’ 
feet and two flights; to lunch room, feet and two flights;
to mathematics room, feet and one flight; to manual
training, feet and one flight; back to assigned room for
wraps and dismissal, feet and two flights; passing out
of building, feet and one flight. Add to this minimum of movements, few trips to the library, or for things
forgotten, or to closets, and we havé an average aggregate,
for each pupil, of not less than three fifths of mile of floor
space and to flights of stairs. If we multiply these
aggregates by  the number of pupils the building is dePe oe DeeLate

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

signed to accommodate, we have grand aggregate distance, for each day, of five hundred miles traveled and  ,  steps taken, up or down, in going over the stairs. I
do not mean to say all pupils will take the studies specified
or travel the same way, but the illustration  fairly representative of minimum average. In connection with
this, it should be held in mind that good part of the time
the pupils are necessarily on their feet, because of the nature of laboratory, blackboard, manual training and other
work. In addition, they have long climb up the hill in
getting to the school house.

Now this statement does not reflect on the building,

for the building is exdingly well planned, and compares
well with others of its class. The same thing could be said
about the stair climbing of other high schools and colleges.
It is ‘alarming, simply because the statement is made
in black and white, and in the aggregate. The average pupil is not hurt by the necessary walking and
stair climbing mentioned; but it is safe to say that
among pupils there will be who will suffer seriously if nothing better can be offered. Indeed, more than one
deserving young lady will be denied the opportunity for a
high school education or sacrifice her health in getting it.
In human economy the life of single pupil is valuable
enough to call for the most serious consideration of this
problem.

I propose simple and comparatively inexpensive solution. Provisions are already being made to make the
stairs as easy as possible; but this is not sufficient. There
should be elevator service in the building. No modernly
equipped building of this size is complete without it. lam
told the cost of such addition would be from  to .
To such elevator, two objections might be raised: the possibility of danger, and the cost of running. The first is
largely imaginary, for statistics show surprisingly low
average of elevator accidents, indeed of less casualty than
from falls on stairs. Besides it is no worse to kill child —

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE. 
quickly than slowly; and neither is necessary. Inthesec- |
ond place, the building will require the presence of an assistant janitor during sweeping and other special hours.
His time during school hours could be spent in running the
elevator.

Foreseeing, from the standpoint of experience, the
inevitable results of attempting the use of this building .
without elevator service, feel it duty to speak now, at
time when provision can be conveniently made. With this
discharge of official duty, shall let the matter rest without further argument. However, if any one doubts the
importunity of this need, would suggest simple experiment., Let him make complete circuit of the floors and
stairs of this building, repeating the same from three to
five times. He will then be ready to form conclusions.

THE WEST STREET GRAMMAR SCHOOL.

This fine new building, costing was opened for
school use in October. very excellent description appears in the principal’s report, making it unnecessary to
make special mention here. Sufficient it is to say, the
building is thoroughly modern in all respects and contains
the highest types of sanitary appurtenances. Such a
building is full of happy ideals and cannot have anything
but refining and moulding influence upon the lives, the
manners and the homes of the children who there attend.
The happiness and high moral tone among the chilren at
the West Street school is living demonstration of the
value of good building and artistic surroundings in the
character building of schools.

It was expected by the committee last summer that
the occupation of eight rooms would be required at the
opening of this school, but the attendance has demanded
twelve rooms, which have been in operation since the start,
and everything now points to additional needs at an early
date. At time of entering the building that part of the

city was redistricted and the boundary lines for attendance
at the several buildings were determined as follows: |

OUR GRAMMAR AND PRIMARY SCHOOLS.

No matter how excellent may be the plans for the upbuilding of high school, the strength of every school system depends upon what is being done in grades preceding.
I desire to express my appreciation of the strong, earnest
interest of the principals and teachers in the plans that
have been brought to them. Many teachers’ meetings have
been held on which attendance has been purely voluntary,
but few indeed have been the absences. ‘The work is being
enriched in many particulars, and will be much more.
Opportunity has been given the different buildings for
original work, and very interesting are the ways in which
strong principals and their assistants have been working
out new and characteristic plans. Many of the schools are
deserving of extended and specialized comment, which
they will in time receive; but this report comes too early
in the present administration to justify any discriminating

* comniendations. For detailed description of the work in
the various buildings, reference is made to the principals’
reports.

MEETINGS WITH SUPERVISORS.

The superintendent desires to meet the supervisors of
drawing, writing, music and physical culture each month
on appointment.

IIO REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

Attendance on meetings is at convenience of the
teachers. However, the discussions to be presented are all
correlative and lead directly to higher plans, the full nature
and value of which will not appear for two or three years
of time. No meeting will stand by itself, but is an integral part in the development of distinctive policy. The
meetings of the first series, in particular, are intended for
all. ‘Teachers need comprehensive views of school work
outside their immediate departments hence workers in advanced grades will profit by glimpses of lower grade work,
and lower grade teachers need the objectives of the higher.

Excepting on days of teachers’ and committee meetings, the superintendent is always in his office on school
days from to o'clock, at which time he will be glad to

| confer concerning the work.
SOCIAL.

It is desirable that the technical meetings should be
 complemented by occasional social gatherings. very
good plan might be inaugurated, upon consultation with
the superintendent, by the evening entertainment of all

as guests of the teachers of some one large building.

HIGH SCHOOL ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS.

The new rules, adopted December  mark long,
forward step in the improvement of the schools; but there
still remains one pressing question, and left over for more

) extended and careful consideration. The transition between the ninth grade and the High school is too abrupt,
and the passing tests too severe and crucial. do not
mean to say that the standard of admission should be lowered; it should rather be raised. But the manner of de| termining who should enter is certainly open to very serious objections. As it is, the one thought of the year is

how shall the examination be passed? Pupils and teachers have, bent all their energies in this one direction.

.  Under such circumstances school work is not for life, but

for the examination’ This ‘Alls the year with’ technical
rather than educational work; it subjects the ‘adolescent
child to over-nervous strain and supernatural exercise,
and is frequently fruitful in the breakage of good health. |
It pays premium on‘ cram and fails to fully recognize
faithful daily work. Beyond this, it frequently passes
pupils whom the principals and teachers cannot recommend, and thus brings early failure and disappointment to
those thus permitted to go on to fail in the High school.

I do not think this examination, as set and uniform requirement, is worth its costs. With the present plan of
responsible decision in the office of Superintendent it is
not necessary. Our principals and teachers are in close
touch with the plans of the Superintendent, and should the
set examination be removed there would be long sigh of
relief, but there would be no laxity. The school department is strong enough to maintain and raise the standard
of scholarship without cast-iron requirements.

No doubt this question is rendered more or less complex by the presence in the city of other schools from which
pupils are received. have every reason to believe that
these schools will co-operate with the public schools in
any worthy plans for the improvement of the educational
interests of the city. The merits of any one school are determined by the kind of pupils it sends out, and no school
to protect its reputation by inferior recommendations.

I therefore recommend: .) That promotions in our
high school be hereafter made upon the recommendation
of the principal under advice from the superintendent,
excepting in cases where examination may be demanded
by the parent. .) That other schools upon given evidence of satisfactory course of study and methods of instruction be, on their request, placed on the list of accredited schools from whom pupils will also be received on
recommendation, such schools to remain on the accredited
list so long as their nominees to the high school shall
prove of satisfactory character. .) That stated exam  “REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

inations be held, as before, for all those not holding such
credentials who desire to give evidence of proper qualifications for admission. .
| PROSPECTIVE PLANS.

This entire year is being spent by the superintendent
in the instruction of teachers and in the establishment of
conditions for improvement of the school work. ‘The general principles laid down and the plan of procedure mapped out in the superintendent’s inaugural address will find
their way more and more into execution as we enter upon
another year. The greatest need of schools everywhere is
for greater conservation of the individual. We must plan
more and more for better health among school children,
for work that will fit individual needs, for the making of
the better thinker, and for greater flexibility in advancements and promotions.  P. W. SEARCH,

DEPARTMENT OF DRAWING AND
ART. |
Mr. P. W. Search, Superintendent of Schools. |
DEAR r:—The importance of drawing and art study
in the public schools was never so fully appreciated as at
the the present time, and the demands made upon those in
charge of these subjects increase with this appreciation.

Results that would have been considered excellent
only few years since, have been left far behind and constant effort is being made to broaden and enrich the pupil’s work.

With this end in view it has been thought best to introduce water color painting into the upper grammar
grades.

During the last year or two experimental work in col- |

or has been done in some of our schools, and with fair success considering the amount of time that could be devoted
to it, but at the beginning of the present school year it was
introduced into Grades VIII and IX as part of the regular work, with the idea of gradually extending it into the
lower grades.
, Good drawing, without doubt, must be the basis of
good art and should never be slighted, but other things
must also be taken into consideration.

, Black and white drawings deal with form and proportion, sometimes with the light and shade, while color, perhaps the most noticeable attribute of an object is utterly
ignored.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  

It is said that savages are entirely unable to understand
or appreciate black and white drawings when they are first
shown to them.

Such drawings are so largely conventional, that the
ability to appreciate them comes only from familiarity and
and training.

When we come to think about it, picture of human being, perhaps only an inch or two high, drawn with
a few black lines isn’t really very much like that which
it is intended to represent.

. But from our earliest childhood we have become soac- |
customed to ignoring the qualities and attributes not represented and to think only of those which are correctly
shown, that we fail to think how much matter of conventionalism the drawing really is. Paintings, on the other
hand, are much more realistic.

Anecdotes are told of fruit painted so true to nature
that birds flew in through the window and pecked at it, and
of the portrait of lady so natural that her dog ran to greet
it, etc.

The love of color, too, is instructive in all, and doubt
if the most carefully finished black and white drawing ever
seems as real to child as much cruder attempt in color.

Shall we not then allow the pupil to use, at least accasionally, this facinating medium of expression? It will
allow him to represent his idea of the object studied
more truthfully and will give an added interest to his work.

The need of more art instruction in our schools, on account of the increased number of pupils, has been felt for .
some time. |

To meet this want, Mrs. Rose Dougherty was appointed assistant in drawing at the beginning of the school year.

Her appointment has made it possible for the schools
to receive more frequent visits and all of the primary and
grammar schools, with the exception of Grade I, now have
a lesson regularly once in two weeks from one of the sup) REPORT OF SCHOO], COMMITTEE.
ervisors, while the High School pupils also are allowed
double time.

I hope that we may keep in closer touch with the
schools by means of these more frequent visits and that an
advance in the pupil’s work may be the result.

To aid in this advance, meetings are held regularly
every two weeks for the upper grade teachers. These
meetings have been well attended, in fact the attendance
has been perfect, and the interest shown by the teachers
has been reflected in their pupils.

While much may be expected from this interest on the
part of the pupils, the desired results cannot be obtained
in the one hour week allotted to art study in our schools.

In view of the many subjects  mperatively demanding
attention, and my own personal interest in the matter, I
should hesitate to urge that more time be devoted to art
study were it not for the fact that the school authorities of
most of the citics and towns leading in edueational matters, and whose united opinion, therefor, may be considered to have weight, have allotted nearly double the time
that we give to this branch of education.

It will be simply impossible for us to rank as we
ought in this department, unless more of the pupil’s time
can be devoted to it.

Moreover, time given to this subject ought not to be regarded as taken from other studies, but rather as preparation for them or the fact lost sight of that the development of the child is the true aim of education, rather than

; the mere acquirement of knowledge.

Successful teachers, of wide experience, in whose
judgment have the utmost confidence, assure me they .
have observed that the absolute necessity of careful observ-'
ation and study on the part of the pupil, if he is to make
an accurate drawing of an object, helps to form habits of !
careful observation and study which influence all his
other work. He reads an example in arithmetic with more care and

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
searches for its meaning more closely. An interest is
awakened in nature and its phenomena which leads to original investigation.

Thus time is saved by the greater capability developed
of approaching any subject where reasoning power is required, and by the habits formed of close observation and
comparison.

This is the opinion of many of those best able to judge
and it seems safe to assume that other studies would gain
rather than lose if more time were devoted to drawing and
art study.

I earnestly hope that this matter may receive consideration.

The high school work in drawing and painting is
progressing well, and yet in art there are always such
broad fields before us, such inspiring possibilities to strive
for that what we are able to accomplish only opens the
way for further effort.

Work in this department is entirely optional yet more
than hundred and fifty pupils have been in the drawing
classes the present year.

More painting and more work in design are being done
than ever before, and, with the additional time allowed,
the results should show marked improvement over those
of former years.

. collection of good casts, photographs, art books and
other material to illustrate fine art is highly desirable in
a high school, in fact absolutely necessary if we are to
secure the best results, and if the art equipment in our
new high school can only be as complete as the building
itself promises to be, we shall be fortunate, indeed.

It gives me great pleasure to note the fact that a
good beginning has been made in the decoration of some
of our school rooms. .

A number of valuable photographs have already been
purchased and now adorn the school room walls. If the
high standard of excellence thus far secured can be main  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
tained, the Holyoke schools will have reason to be proud of
their art collections.

It has been said that ‘‘a fine picture on the wall is an
educating power’’; it might be added, and refining influence.

In view of the widespread attention that is now being
given to this subject, and the rapidity with which it has
sprung into prominence, it seems strange that the power
of these mute yet eloquent teachers has not sooner been
taken advantage of, and that the atmosphere of refinement
and culture which they give to school room has not
sooner been appreciated.

On some accounts fine pictures scattered through the
different school buildings will exert wider influence than
if gathered together in an art gallery.

The gallery would be visited mostly by those already
somewhat interested in art, while the pictures in the school
rooms, which the pupils see constantly and thus become
thoroughly familiar with, if really fine, will teach them to
know and appreciate truly good art.

In order to secure the greatest possible benefit from
the pictures, itis necessary thatthe pupils not only see but
study them also.

They will have more intelligent interest in them if
they know about the artists by whom they were painted,
under what circumstances, and what they were intended
tO express.

Then as they study different pictures by the same
artist they will gradually gain knowledge of his style of
painting, and later by grouping the works of different
artists they might gain knowledge of schools of painting.

Holyoke's citizens own many choice and valuable
paintings, and these have on several occasions generously
been loaned for an exhibition to which the general public

long intervals, while the school room pictures would exert
a constant influence.

The principals of our schools realize this, and if the
plans already made are successfully carried out some of
our school buildings will become veritable art centers—
miniature art museums which will in part supply the lack
of public museum, and cannot fail in time to exert an
educating influence upon the whole community.

In conclusion, let me say that while much has been
accomplished, feel that there are possibilities not yet attained in our art study, and that we shall all need to work
heartily together in the future as in the past for the advancement of our schools. Respectfully yours,

Supervisor of Drawing.

: DEPARTMENT OF PENMANSHIP.
Mr. P. W. Search, Superintendent of Schools :

DEAR SiR :—During the past year the attention of all
educators has been especially called to the subject of penmanship. There has been revolution in this branch of
learning. ‘This revolution has not been without its good
effects. It has established more firmly the importance of
securing practical and legible hand writing, and has
drawn attention more closely to the physiological side of
penmanship. There is nothing more important than a

) healthful and erect position during writing practice. Poor
school furniture is, in great measure, responsible for poor
position. During the past year some of the most objectionable desks were removed,’ and new and more suitable ones
substituted. This has proved very helpful.

Within the last few months Smith’s Educational System of Penmanship has been introduced into the Training
school. This course differs very slightly from the vertical,
the degree of slant being seventy-five. Thus far results
have been gratifying.

One of the happiest features of the year’s work has
been the interest displayed by the parents, and many were
the comments of appreciation concerning the invitations
written by the pupils in connection with the recent harvest
festival.

In justice to the principals and teachers who so read, ily co-operate with me, and the pupils, whose earnest endeavors are such source of delight, it can be said that

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  I
the penmanship department has taken no backward steps
along the line of progress, but rather, in the spirit of the
age, we have armed for higher degree of excellence.

I would like, if possible and if it could beconveniently 
arranged, to have uniformity of time in writing practice
prevail in the different grades throughout the city. A
period of time each day should be devoted to care. ful and painstaking practice. Short periods are better
than long ones, for the reason that the closest application
is required. Twenty minutes day would be adequate.
In remembering that-‘‘ practice makes perfect,’’ it must not
be forgotten that it is intelligent and discriminating practice which makes perfect. There is, ’tis true, great
amount of miscellaneous writing in school work, but in
this the brain, taken up almost wholly with the subject
matter, gives very little thought to the formation of letters
and the action of the hand is almost unconscious. Unless
a good foundation has been lain such practice, instead of
improving, emphasizes faults already formed, which become more firmly fixed through force of habit.

In conclusion, wish to thank those connected with
me in my work, and to gratefully acknowledge the cordial
support of the Superintendent in all plans for the advancement of this department.

ESTHER AGNES MACDONNELL,

Supervisor of Penmanship.
 

DEPARTMENT OF MUSIC.
To the Superintendent of Schools, Holyoke.

DEAR R:—I herewith submit my report on vocal
music in the schools of Holyoke.

The principles underlying the method of teaching are
those that have been worked out in these schools in practical operation for the past twenty years.

These principles are based on the correct development of the physical, mental and emotional faculties of the
child, viz: proper breathing, correct articulation, pure tone
production, development of rhythm and intervals and the
singing of songs with taste and feeling.

The keeping of the child’s voice within the limits of
its physical growth ts strictly insisted upon.

The development of proper breathing and correct articulation must go hand in hand and result in improvement of the child’s physical condition, its general vocal
utterance and establish pure tone production,

By the development of the intervals psychologically
the mental faculties of the child receive stimulus to the
concentration of its powers.

The rhythm is developed intuitively at first until it
becomes part of the individual and is not taught by
mechanical means, for mechanical impression begets a
mechanical expression, Therefore, insist that the songs
shall be sung rhythmically, that is with proper shading
and phrasing; for experience has shown that the children’s
emotional faculties are in this way developed in proper

| REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
lines. One, two, three and four part singing is taken up
in successive order throughout the various grades.

As to the results obtained by the development of these
principles perhaps the words of commendation that have
been given by prominent educators who have been attracted from various parts of the country to hear our singing, is the highest praise for which we could ask.

I would here like to thank the teachers who have so
heartily given me their fullest co-operation.

In order to make the work more uniform, the plan has
been adopted of marking the standing of each room at
every visit make. would also respectfully submit for
consideration the important step of marking the pupils in
the grammar and high schools, individually in their standing in music, for itis the development of the individual
that should be aimed at in music as in all other branches
and this addition will go far toward securing what have
aimed at for many years, the true correlation of music with
the other branches of the school curriculum.

Respectfully submitting this report, am "

Most truly yours,
FRIEDRICH ZUCHTMANN,
Supervisor of Music.

DEPARTMENT OE PHYSICAL
TRAINING.
Mr. P. W. Search, Superintendent of Schools:

As director of physical education it becomes pleasant duty to report the general condition of this department.

This part of education is, beyond all doubt, one of the
grandest gifts to our youth in the public schools, and
enough cannot be done for this branch of education.

The old saying that ‘‘a sound mind can only exist in
a healthy body’’ is as true today as in times when it was
quoted, and nothing more noble can be thought of than
the prosperity of the bodily and intellectual faculties of
our scholars.

As to what the result is, my work for the past six .
years in the public schools of Holyoke speaks for itself 
and as the same work has been crowned by good results since

the scholars have taken liking to gymnastics every year.

Of our scholars, we have about forty who do not
take part; and these are excused as circumstances do not
permit them to take part in the gymnastics.

The exercises are very well executed, also the discipline throughout is good, and can say, that under the
the present circumstances the teachers do good work.

The system which is taught in our schools is ‘‘The
American System of Physical Education.’’ The same is
founded on the natural basis of progression and upon the

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
laws of physiology. The work is so arranged as to fit
the different ages of the eight school years of the scholars,
and also those who are further advanced.

The exercises are so arranged that they strictly accommodate themselves to natural gymnastics, preserve
their naturalness, and conform exactly with established
physiological principles, and strictly in obedience to the
laws of natural development.

To bring out the best results of gymnastics, it is absolutely necessary that our teachers should receive special
lessons weekly. It is not only to the benefit of our scholars, but also to our teachers, who by their work have
their nerves weakened, and as consequence suffer from
nervousness.

It would be acceptable if the Honorable School Committee would so place me financially, that could give all
my time to the work in our schools.

I desire at this time to thank you, as superintendent,
and teachers for your co-operation in my efforts to develop
what is noblest and best to the youth in our schools,

Very respectfully,
| F. EGER,
Physical Director.

Mr. P. W. Search. s
DEAR SIR: During the past year the high school has
progressed steadily along the old lines. The ever-increasing members, the inadequacy of the old building in equipment and arrangement, and the lack of room for needed
teachers have rendered it impossible even to attempt

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
marked changes. In fact, under existing circumstances,
to hold our own is success.

As to the building itself, believe that all the class
rooms should be provided with gas fixtures. At present
only the assembly hall and Miss James’ room are thus fur| nished, and on very dark days work must be discontinued
or the pupils compelled to study under conditions exdingly trying gud hurtful to the eyes.

A brief statement of the condition of each of the departments into which the school work is divided may be of
interest. The college preparatory department is satisfactory. We have this year sent four pupils to Smith College, three to Mt. Holyoke, three to Wellesley, one to
Amherst, and two to Cornell University. Favorable reports are heard from these students all along the line.

In the English department, under the guidance of
Miss Fay, marked improvement has been made within the
last few years. There is nowa definite and well considered
plan, embracing in its grasp every pupil in the school, and
the results so far are highly satisfactory. .

The scientific department is hampered by lack of
proper equipnient especially for the study of physics, and

by the amount of work that necessarily devolves upon the
teacher. An assistant in this department will surely be a
necessity next year.

Notwithstanding adverse conditions, Miss Hasbrouck
has sucded in inspiring considerable interest in the
work. ‘The classes are larger than ever before, and all
signs point to vigorous and healthy growth in this department in the new building. 

The Latin, Greek and modern language departments
have been attended’ to under the general head of college .
preparatory work. All are in good hands and show good
results. :

Perhaps the greatest and most pressing need of the
school is large, well selected reference library for the use

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
of pupils. There is also constant need of large microscope.

In conclusion, wish to call attention to one or two
suggestions in my last annual report. First. The business course at the new building should cover three years’
work, and should include literature, history and science.

Second. In the new building there should be lady
teacher of calisthenics. She should be thoroughly grounded
in physiology and anatomy, and thus be prepared to make
a study of the physical needs of each pupil under her care.

. Yours very truly,

W. HF. JUDD.

CONDITION OF THE NONOTUCK STREET SCHOOL BUILDING.
| This building has many objectionable features that
seriously injure its usefulness.

It is too small and inconvenient. It was built and intended for small school fifteen years ago. It was erected
as an eight room structure witn no provision for an enlargement. When it became crowded in  the roof
was raised and third story added. This made demand

- for additional stairways, and they were placed in the halls
which were already small. Since that time there is hardly
room to open the doors leading to some of the rooms, and
but little room for the large number of pupils to pass to
and fro. The upper stairs are steep, winding and some

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
of the steps triangular, and therefore inconvenient for use.
The highest floor was ‘never ‘‘deadened’’ and has
been great source of annoyance to the rooms underneath, as the noise above can be distinctly heard in the
rooms below. Many petitions have been made for remedy, but the evil still exists. The windows in the third
story are too near the floor—within twenty-five inches.
This is dangerous for the pupils, and an iron bar should
be placed across the lower part of each window as measure of protection to the children. .
There is but one outlet from the building, unless we
count the one that goes through the boys’ closets.

A large school should have three or four outlets that
might be used, not only in case of fire, but at all times
when pupils pass in and out. Were it not for the single
outlet we would prefer to take the pupils into the open
yards for recess fi pleasant weather.

, With three or four outlets this could be done with little loss of school time, which is the principal objection to
out-of-door recess. .

The basement is nearly filled since the five furnaces
and ducts that were placed there by the Fuller Warren
Company. ‘There is now no room for pupils’ use before
the sessions commence.

The walls in the rooms and hallways are ina bad
condition as but little has been done to clean or whiten
them for about ten years. Improvement is sadly needed
here.

The sanitary condition of the building is not good
because of the closets. The girls’ closets are practically
in the hallways, and were formerly teacher’s dressifig
room. When the crowding came, this was turned into the
closets for the girls. There are but three closets for the
girls—about  in number.

  ‘There is but little room in these quarters, the original
dressing rooms being very small. The quarters are unfit
for modern time. |

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

The boys’ apartments are but little better. They
contain but three closets for boys.

The ventilation from the closets was first drawn into
the fan chamber, and then driven by the fan out of the
building. But, if for any reason the fan was not at work,
the foul air was free to travel to the fan chamber, and
then back through another pipe into the rooms. Hence,
under certain conditions, liable to exist, the ventilation
was from the closets into the rooms. After awhile the
Fuller Warren Company made such progress in their
views of ventilation as to think it was not right to ventilate water closet into school room, and did truly change
this part and connected the ventilation pipe from the
closet with the smoke chimney instead of the fan chamber.

The water that is used to moisten the hot-air is carried
by the janitor in pail to the water pan from the sink. A
pipe should carry this water to the panin the furnace.

FIRE ESCAPES.

The fire stairs on the outside of the building have not
a railing sufficiently high and strong. If person should
stumble while going down the stairs he would be liable
to fall over the railing. This danger should be averted by
a safe stair-rail.

SYSTEM OF VENTILATION.

In the summer of hot-air system of ventilation

was placed in this school by the Fuller Warren Com*pany. The building had been heated by steam.

* ‘The system is far from perfect. There are two important features in which it fails. It does not thoroughly
heat the building on cold days, and often on days that are
not very cold. The furnaces have not sufficient capacity.
We have suffered more from cold since we have had this
system than we did in any year before.

In the next place, it is often impossible to cool the

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
rooms by opening the cold air duct when the rooms are
too warm. }

When the cold-air duct is opened the temperature
often remains the same for an hour. It seems that the air
that is supposed to be cool air is partly warmed in some
way before it reaches the room. Although the cold air
does not pass as close to the furnace pot as the warm-air
does, yet it passes sufficiently near to become warm, and
therefore comes into the room often, as warm-air. The
rule of the company is that we should not open the windows on any occasions, yet this, the only way we can cool
a room, when it is too warm, and this way is injurious to
the health of the pupils on account of the cold-air current
from outside.

There are serious defects in the working of this system, and they should not be overlooked by our authorities. .

It is claimed also that the outlet from the fan chamber is too small, and that the air in consequence is turned
back again upon the fan: of this matter am not competent to judge. larger exit is now being made by the
company. Itis impossible to heat the boys’ closet, no
heat will go there unless there is very hot fire in the
furnace, and unless the heat is shut off from all the
rooms supplied with heat from this furnace. Thisisa
serious defect in the operation of the system, as it now
stands; the cjosets are very cold, and ice is found in them
on cold davs.

“PLACE FOR STORING COAL.

The large supply of coal has been stored in the nortfwest corner of the basement; three of the furnaces are in
the eastern haif of the basement, and the work of carrying
the coal the long distance to these furnaces imposes much
unnecessary work on the janitor.

There is large portion of the basement unoccupied
in the middle-east part, and an opening can be easily made

  REPORT OF SCHOOI, COMMITTEE.

for putting in the coal. Half of the coal could be put in

front and half in the rear of the building. It seems unjust

that thejaniior should be put every day to considerable

work that could be saved by very little outlay.
EDUCATIONAL.

The school has not many special features, but has
tried to maintain all branches at fair standard.

DEPARTMENTAL TEACHING.

Departmental teaching was tried last year in some of
the newer branches, principally nature study—and these
branches were much better taught in this way. Each
teacher could give better and more material to her pupils
when her range of study was more limited. It is our intention to supply this method to few of the leading studies
in the grammar grades, as soon as some additional accommodations can be secured. It is not wise, with our
present large numbers, in the higher grades, to have the
pupils taught under too many teachers.

This method of departmental teaching is preferable
for the newer branches in which teachers were not educated
in their school days.

“HISTORY IN THE SEVENTH GRADE.
) The only history taught in our schools, has been that
of the United States, and has been commenced in the
eighth grade and completed inthe ninth. We have now
introduced United States history to the seventh grade and
intend to find time.
GEOGRAPHY.

We have thought for years that there should be an
entire revolution in the plan of teaching some parts of
geography. |
 single day’s lesson often includes six or seven different subjects, and it is difficult to see how child can be

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
interested in them all. It is hard for any person to be
interested in large number of subjects at the same time.
It would be much better to get pupils fairly familiar with
the general outline of the geography of the earth, and after that teach nearly all the remainder of geography by
‘“Topic.’’ For instance, an interest should be created in
rivers; their source, movements, uses to man, etc., and
then the rivers of the world studied while the mind has an
interest in the subject. Then the other subjects in
physical geography should be treated singly and traced
into political geography. After awhile the whole subject
would be covered in way far more logical, and with much
more intersst on the part of the pupils.

Geography should consume less time in school. There
is no good reason why it could not be completed in three
years. More attention should be paid to physical
geography, especially in time when we are paying so
much attention to nature.

WEATHER MAPS.

This school now receives daily from Boston, weather
maps, and we are to study the natural phenomena from
which these forecasts are drawn. |

NEW TEACHERS.

Within the past year five new teachers have been appointed to the school, either to fill vacancies, or to meet
the demands of overcrowded rooms.

Miss K. G. Shine was appointed in the spring term to
grade one.

Mrs. Sara Wilcoxen was appointed in August assistant in grade nine.

Miss Ella Smith was appointed in October to grade
three.

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

Miss R. A. Cook, of Springfield, has just been appointed to an overflow room made up of grades eight and
nine.

There are now eighteen teachers in the school, principal and seventeen assistants.

DEPARTMENTAL TEACHING.

Departmental teaching was tried last year in three ,
rooms. This year the system has been extended so as to
include all the grades above the third. Because of this
system of instruction and the addition of Miss Martin to
our corps of teachers, it has been found expedient to introduce several new features, namely Latin, physics, and
sewing.

PHYSICS.

A laboratory has been prepared in our hall, where the
upper classes assemble each week to perform experiments.
In place of the old way of the teacher performing an experiment before the class, each member of the class performs
the experiment and records his own observations and draws
his own inferences. One hour week is given to this subject. .

LATIN.

The eighth class have Latin one hour week and the
ninth one and one-half hours week. It is not our inten- .
tion to prepare pupils for the second year of the high school,

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

but to supplement our English work by the Latin and
give the pupils thorough knowledge of the first declension and the first conjugation. The work includes large
aniount of translation, and thorough knowledge of all
kinds of construction, of sentences formed from words of
the first declension and first conjugation.

SEWING.

One hour week is devoted to this branch in all the
grades. In grades four and five the boys as well as the
girls sew. While this plan may be beneficial to the boys,
it is hardly just to the girls, who cannot advance as fast
as they would, were they not held back by the boys. In
the other grades the boys are given an extra lesson in
manual training, while the girls are receiving instruction
in sewing. The work varies in the grades. From the
fifth grade up drill has been given in folding and basting
hems, hemming, patching, over sewing, and sewing on
buttons. trust that the committee may see the way clear
to hire teacher for this branch as the one now doing this
work can be better employed in higher work, as physics,
and chemistry.

MANUAL TRAINING.

This work has been continued through the year. The
following figures will give general idea of the work
accomplished. Just before the Christmas vacation, in the
three upper classes the following articles were made and
taken home as Christmas presents to friends. Thirty-four

. handkerchief boxes, eight picture frames, twenty-five jewel
boxes, and thirty-four wall pockets. Each one of these
articles was decorated by carving, stained, and varnished
by the pupils. trust regular teacher may be procured
this year for this important work. We have been at work
long enough to see the many advantages from work of this
kind. regular instructor for the upper grades is, however, necessity.

) REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
GEOMETRY——-ALGEBRA.

Twenty-five lessons for each of the three upper grades
have been prepared in Geometry during the past year.
The work is largely constructive, but when demonstration
is demanded the work is expected to be original with the
pupils. Hints and suggestions are given but no demonstrations to be memorized.

In Algebra twenty-five lessons for each of the two upper
grades are nearly ready, based on the equation. This work
is intended to supplement and enrich the work in Arithmetic, but in no case is it intended to crowd out other
things or to make the work of the pupils harder.

WANTS.

I. Wewanta Kindergarten. We trust that soon we
can have one in the building. ‘There is certainly great
need of one in this section of the city.

 The rooms and corridors on the upper floor need
to be cleansed and painted.

 The sanitary conditions of the closets is growing
worse all the time. The odor from them can be noticed in
all parts of the building at certain times. When the ventilating system was put in the building little over year
ago, the closets were not connected with the system. This
was an oversight that should be remedied at once, as serious consequences may result if the present state of things
continues.

 The radiator in the reception room is too small to
warm the room except in very mild weather. larger one
should be put in and double windows provided.

 Our corridors are too dark. This could be partially remedied by placing glass panels in the doors.

 Porches should be placed at both side entrances.
This would provide protection to the pupils from the
storms.

In conclusion wish to thank you and the committee
for the courtesy and help extended to us during the year.

In compliance with your request, cheerfully submit
the following report :

The West street Grammar school was duly organized
September,  The number of pupils presenting themselves required the immediate occupancy of twelve of the
sixteen rooms. The construction of the magnificent building was watched with considerable interest by many citizens, especially by those intensely interested in the erection
of school buildings properly equipped with those appurtenances necessary and essential in carrying out successfully the present progressive werk of education; serving,
also, as incentives to teachers, arousing in them lively
interest in their work and stimulating them to perform
their arduous duties with feeling of pleasure and cheerfulness.

A detailed description of the building appears to me to 
be unnecessary. Yet there are certain special advantages
existing here which wish to mention, treating each as
briefly as possible. |

The class rooms are large, airy and well lighted. An
assembly hall is provided on the third floor, where the
classes may be assembled on certain days, either for general advice, or in celebrating the anniversary of some historical date, or  commemoration of some famous person,
whether military or literary.

We are especially fortunate in having suitable. play
grounds, together with the spacious basements, which are.
used by the children for play grounds during: the long
morning recess when the inclemency of the weather prevents the children going outside.

  REPORT OF SCHOOI COMMITTEE.
FURNITURE. ,

We have in use in several rooms adjustable furniture.
The advantage of this kind of furniture may be shown by
the following: ‘‘ The furniture is adapted to the child
and not the child to the furniture.’’ :
| The heating and ventilating system has worked very
satisfactorily, fact much appreciated by the teachers and
enjoyed by the children, many of whom, since the beginning of their school duties, have attended buildings where,
on account of lack of proper ventilating system and the
close proximity of the surrounding buildings, fresh air was
a rare quantity.

/ ELECTRIC CLOCKS AND SPEAKING TUBES.

The class rooms and hall are equipped with electric
clocks and speaking tubes.

The speaking tubes in the different rooms are directly
connected with the principal’s, so that it is possible for the
principal to comimunicate with teacher in reference to
school matters without being obliged to leave the office,
and visa versa.

The class room clocks are furnished with time and
regulated by large office clock. Two electrical dial arrangements are connected with the office clock, where programs of the order of exercises may be adjusted.

These dials are regulated and furnished with time by
the large clock, and in addition control all the bells in the
different rooms, so that after the programs have been arranged and adjusted to the dials, the bells in all the rooms
ring at uniform time, as arranged on program, either in
announcing the beginning or closing of the period of
study and recitation, opening of school, dismissal, or recess.

MODELING ROOM.

Through the kindness of Chairman Linehan the end
room on the second floor has been suitably equipped for
modeling work in clay, sand, or any suitable material.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  

This room will be found especially advantageous and
a pleasant assistant to the general work in geography and
history. 

The room is constructed on the following plan: There
are two large semi-circular tables, each divided in such a
manner that sufficient space is provided to allow pupils
to work at one time. Each child’s space is provided with
a double sliding box, which may be filled with clay or
sand, or, in case two classes were to use the room on the
same day, one side may be filled with sand and the other
with clay, so that no time need be wasted in preparation
for the work.

A set of boards has also been supplied which witl be
used only when the class is working with clay, the tops of
the table being suitable for thesand. Provision has also been
made by placing cleats on the legs of the tables, where unfinished work may be placed, free from interference of the
sucding class. This room will also be found helpful
and beneficial in carrying out successfully the elementary
courses in physics and chemistry. As it provides suitable room where the children may have the opportunity of
performing personally the simple experiments that tend to
make these subjects interesting and instructive.

CIVICS AND HISTORY.

That the safety of the republic is best to be attained
through the development of lofty patriotism, and that the
true love of country is love for the institutions which
makes life in country worth the living, affording and
opening wide the door of opportunity and advancement;
in order that our institutions shall be loved, it is
essential and, in fact, necessary, to show they are worthy
of such love.

Where and when, then, may the seed of this love be
better planted than in the child’s mind during his early
school days. If such seeds are properly planted and
through sucding years nourished with wholesome foods,

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
our children will grow up imbued with the highest love
and respect for our country and its institutions.

With such an end in view, have dutlined an elementary course in history and civics. History extending from
grades to  civics from tog. Feeling that the two subjects should go jointly, each tending to make the other
more interesting and instructive: Civics, the science of
the state, especially the state as it is now; history, the
processes by which the state has come to its present condition.

Beginning with the lower grades, the outlines of these
subjects are so systematized that if perused carefully by
the person whose duty it is to impart the knowledge and |
under whose guidance the children directly come, many
children, who, through necessity, are obliged to leave
school at an early age, and under the old curriculum,
would leave without obtaining any specific knowledge
of our government, its laws and its development, will now
depart with certain amount of definite knowledge of its
early history and its gradual development from its primeval state into this grand and powerful republic. It may
also be prominent factor in inspiring the child’s mind
with feeling of esteem and admiration for our many
heroes.

ADVANCED HISTORY.

The study of history from text books has been generally confined to grades and g. At the beginning of last
term placed the books of this subject in the hands of the
children of grades seven. ,

The result has been that the children of that grade
have proven themselves as capable of undertaking the
subject at this time as well as year hence. :

The advantages to be derived from this change are
numerous. Namely, it will prove valuable aid to the
teacher in training the children to talk and answer questions correctly and logically. It may also be the means of

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE. 
arousing in the child’s mind desire of inquiry and spirit of investigation, perchance leading to the reading of
historical stories and biographies. It will also afford an
excellent opportunity of devoting one term of the goth
grade’s time to the study of French and English history,
especially those periods embracing questions concerning
our nationol development.

LITERATURE.

During the last term submitted to Supt. Search a
requision for larger number of the Riverside Series.

The list was approved and the greater part of the
order has been secured.

These books were formerly used as supplementary
readers. Now they have rather become the daily companion of the children in all grades above the first. When
the full order has been received the building will be supplied so as to allow each grade ‘having differcnt set each
term, no two grades using the same books.

THE LIST OF PART OF THE SERIES.

Lady of the Lake, Snow Bound, Fortunes of the Republic, Washington’s rules of conduct, Bryant’s Tella
Thanatopsis, Evangeline, Courtship of Miles Standish,
Paul Revere’s Ride and Other Poems, Children’s Poenis,
Longfellow’s Leaflets, Holmes’ Leaflets, Whittier’s Leaflets, Lowell’s Leaflets, Wild Apples and Sounds, Thoreau’s
Succession of Forest Trees, Grandmother’s Stories of
New England, vols., Fables and Folk Stories, vols.

SCIENCES.
) Courses have been outlined in the following subjects:
botany, geology, physics, chemistry, sewing.

The subjects have been assigned to special teachers,
so that more systematic policy may be carried out and
more beneficial results obtained.

The course in botany during this term consists chiefly

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

of preparing the children so that they may be better able
to take up the subject more intelligently during the spring
term, when nature so abundantly supplies us the materials —
suitable to the teaching of that subject.

Geology.—This course consists chiefly of thirty-minute talks by the teachers once every two weeks on topics
assigned by the principal. These talks are intended to
furnish data suitable for composition work.

LIST OF TOPICS.
I. Formation ot Soil. Disintregration of Rock. |
II. Erosion of Rivers, Deltas, Base Level, Course. |
III. Ocean Currents, Waves, Tides, Rains.
IV. Spring, Artesian Wells, Geysers, Salt Lakes.
V. Formation of Coal and Iron.
VI. Earthquakes and Volcanoes.
VII. Icebergs and Glaciers.
VIII. Carboniferous System.
IX. Formation of Granite.

Physics and Chemistry.—The purpose of this course
is chiefly to cultivate in the minds of the children habit
of close and exact observation, and power to form correct inferences from facts observed. In order to secure
this it is essential that the pupil’s mind be brought into
direct contact with such facts. -This can be obtained in no
better way than by allowing each pupil to perform individually the simple experiments under the guidance and
observation of the teacher.

On certain days it is intended to have the children
write formal compositions, treating briefly the experiments
performed and the changes noted in the progress of such
experiments.

After each experiment few minutes will be devoted
by the teacher in asking questions touching directly on the
experiment, being careful in insisting on the child giving
an intelligent and logical answer. The whole course is
under the direct supervision of the principal, who, week .



REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
previous to each lesson, will submit to the teachers an outline containing the principles to be treated and the simple
experiment to illustrate such principles. During the |
Spring term chemistry will be substituted for physics..

Physiology has been substituted for language, one
hour per week, in all grades during the winter term.

Arithmetic.—The study of mensuration, instead of
being scattered through the whole year, is to be confined
to the first five weeks of the winter term.

PROMOTIONS.

There is nothing more wholesome and beneficial in
stimulating and arousing the mental activities of children
than full recognition and appreciation of their ability
and efficiency, when displayed and made evident in their
daily school work. )

How can this appreciation and encouragement be
manifested in school work? Ii daily business life when
misfortunes remove an efficient and faithtul clerk, whose
vacancy  to be immediately filled by selection from the
numerous clerks employed, the question of promotion generally turns upon the qualifications of trustworthiness and
faithfulness in the performance of obligations imposed, obedience to the orders of theirsuperiors and attention manifested in the success of the business of the employer. One  s
found to excel in these qualities and is promoted. The generaleffect of such promotionis an ardent desire of the promoted to continue to work faithfully and dilligently, and
a determination of many of the non-promoted to follow |
their companions’ footsteps with the hope that their good
qualities may also be recognized and rewarded.

So in school work. There is nothing (as observed by
the promotions made in my building during the last year
and half) more pleasing and gratifying to the child’s
mind and productive of better school work than full
recognition of faithful and dilligent school work.

The pleasure even penetrates farther; it penetrates the

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

home. The promotion attracts the attention of the parents;
it arouses their interest. They are anxious to know just
what their child has been doing, and immediately set to
work to assist and encourage the child in performing the
new duties required. Under such circumstances double
benefit is derived, for it assists not only the child but the
parents as well.

In closing, wish to state briefly the plan pursued and
the reason why Iam so strongly in favor of promotion at
any time during the term, when such promotions may be
made so that the child will be the gainer.

The plan is simple. required the teachers on receiving new class at the beginning of the year to note
very carefully during the first month the individual ability
of the children. That having been obtained we jointly
follow the progress of each child and as soon as the children show by daily work that they are being retarded by
remaining in that class they are promoted, providing their
physical ability will permit.

The case wish to cite was my last year’s grade nine.
At the close of the spring term called together about
fifty per cent. of grade seven and informed them that if
they studied United States history during the vacation
(reaching certain epoch) would give them treat in
grade nine. In the fall nineteen presented themselves,
having fulfilled their promise.

The result was that during the term three were sent
back to grade eight and the others passed successful examinations into the high school, several reaching very
high marks. have watched their work in the high
school, and on inquiry have been informed that they were
all doing excellent work.

, REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
Superintendent P. W. Search.

Agreeable to your request, herewith submit my
report for the past year. Changes in our teaching force
have been frequent in the past, and the last year has been
no exception in that respect. ,

The resignation of Miss Hayes, who had for year
efficiently carried on the work of the eighth grade, was received after the close of last spring term, and’ her place
was filled by Miss Nash, formerly of the Nonotuck Street
school. Ill health necessitated her retirement for season
and the grade is now under the charge of Miss Callahan,
who has had charge of the West Holyoke school. Such
frequent changes are not conducive to the best results in a
school, yet the work has suffered as little as possible.
With these exeeptions the teaching force remains the same
as in the previous year.

When this school entered upon its career two years :
ago, it was made up, as far as grade six, of the scholars in
the old Elmwood mixed grade school, who had been suffering from extreme overcrowding. Accordingly our work |
has thus far been rather conservative in character, it being
deemed wiser to bring all grades fully into line before entering upon any other work, however desirable. We have
now reached point, however, where we may begin to
branch out little. Situated as we are on the outskirts
of the city, our opportunities for the study of nature are
more than ordinarily good, and should be improved. We
have already done something in the study of plants’ life,
but there is more we can do and hope to do soon. Forthe
study of animal and bird life we are exdingly fortunately situated. With the study of the phenomena of
physics and chemistry we have’ done nothing as yet but
expect totake uptheir study at once. Work along these
lines has been greatly facilitated by the introduction of
coior work. Indeed, in the upper grades this work has resulted in the discovery of no little artistic talent. Heretofore, this part of the city has contributed but little to the

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
membership of the high school. Last June, however, we
graduated sixteen, fourteen of whom went to the high
schuol, though some have since given up the work for the
present. Of the other two, one is studying music at present. The upper grades are holding their numbers well,
and are large in proportionto the number of lower grade
scholars. In these facts we see considerable cause for
gratification.

Our library received few additions during the year,
andin this point we are particularly lame. We have in it
at present about forty-five books, not great collection

, compared to our needs. Those we have were obtained
mostly from the prods of school exhibition, but owing
to the lack of suitable hall and the necessary encroachment on school work, it was thought advisable not to repeat it last year. No other means of raising money sug gested itself, and as we felt reluctance about asking the
cltizens for contributions of money, the library has not
grown. It would be great aid in school work, if the
school board could manage in some way to aidinthe
building up of the school libraries. One way which I
would suggest, would be to have fund set apart each
year to be apportioned ainong the schools according to
their needs. It would not take very considerable sum
to be very material aid to the schools.

No important changes havs been made in the building itself during the past year. Some of the walls are beginning to look dirty, and there is need of paint and varnish in some places, but in general the building is in excellent repair. We are in need of some good walks in the
grounds, however, especially the rear of the building,
which is mud-hole in wet weather. cinder walk
raised slightly above the general level of the ground
would be best as it would not interfere with the use of that
part of the grounds as play-ground in dry weather.

Very respectfully,
G. H. D. L; AMOUREUX, Principal.

NORMAL TRAINING SCHOOL.
MRS. MARY R. DAVIS, PRINCIPAL.
P. W. Search, Superintendent of Schools.

DEAR r:—In reply to your request weuld say that
the Park street school building is in tolerably good condition, considering the fact that it was built before the age of
modern improvements.

The conditions for good lighting, and the seating
arrangements are poor in several rooms, the light coming
from the right instead of left; from the bottom rather than
top of windows, many of the seats are too small for our
pupils, some are too large. |

Its location and arrangement are poor for training
and practice school in many ways.

The building is poorly equipped for even primary or
grammar school, as there is great dearth of school apparatus such as charts, drawing models and tablets, wall and
relief maps, globes, reference books, etc.; but for training
and practice school it is still more poorly equipped for,
such school should have the best that city can afford.

Let us consider its work. It takes pupils who have
graduated in high standing from our high schools and |
trains them to the grandest, noblest profession we have ;
for, there is no work in this universe, excepting that of the
mother, which so closely touches humanity and from which
there radiates more of an influence for Eternity than the

  REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
work of teacher. The true teacher is building for the
future, here and hereafter.

For two years (it should be longer) these young ladies
are given instruction in practical educational psychology
and child study, history of education, art of school management, and general methods in reading, number and
arithmetic, language and grammar, nature study, elementary science, geography, history and civics, music, drawing, writing and calisthenics. They are also given the
opportunity to observe good model teaching that they may
know how subjects should be presented.

In connection with the normal department  the practice department, which is the most distinctive and important feature of the school, where the pupil teacher is given
an opportunity to test the theories and principles which
have been presented in the normal class-room and to
acquire skill in teaching and managing an ordinary school.
Lessons are planned and taught under the supervision and
kindly criticism of principal and assistant; decipline and
special needs of special pupils, and of the school, are discussed freely thus the young teacher acquires self-control
and confidence in her ability and powers as teacher, and
a broad view of the entire field.

You may ask ‘‘what of the pupils in the practice
school?’’ Some have considered it doubtful experiment
to place children under pupil-teachers; but, intelligent
people, who have looked well into the facts, tell us that
the teaching done by pupil-teachers (under careful supervision) is not only equal to but superior to the teaching
done by untrained teachers. The child, though he has
been instructed by several teachers, has been brought in
close contact with the same number of minds and he will

| have broader and more comprehensive view of the subject presented.

The training school costs the city less than any other
school of equal size, because the pupil-teachers, who are
paid the nontinal sum of ten dollars mouth the second

;

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
year save the salaries of regular teachers in the same
rooms.

At the same time, it is sending out well trained and
equipped teachers who have the advantage of being carefully trained under the same conditions, with the same
material, the same grades and the same course of study
which they will find when they go out into the field alone.
Herein lies the practical value of the institution to the city
and the superior advantage to the pupil-teacher.

 IT repeat that because of its work—the training for the
highest and best—the training school  entitled to the best
that city can afford. It should be located in central
section of the city, easy of access; should have good
kindergarten department and practice room; should have
added to its regular work departments of manual training
and sewing, where the young ladies are trained first to do .
themselves and then are taught how to train others to do.

It should be equipped with good laboratory with
good collections of animal and mineral specimens as an
aid to scientific investigation. These can be procured at
little cost and would be of incalculable value to the
‘teachers and the city.

There is also great need of model relief maps and
globes, of wall maps, charts and more reference books on
professional, scientific, and geographical subjects.

At the present time because of the action of the School
Board last year in regard to closing the school, there are
but ten young ladies in the normal department, all of
whom will graduate next June.

There are seven rooms and six regular grades in the
building besides the normal class room. Five of these
rooms are in charge of pupil teachers under the close
supervision of principal and assistant. In two of the
rooms there are regular teachers, in which the young
ladies are to teach certain subjects for practice, as time
will allow.

It is the desire of the principal and assistant that the

  REPORT OF SCHOO] COMMITTEE.
members of the school board and representative citizens of
this city visit this department of our school system and
understand something of the effort and work being put forward for the advancement of education.
: Very truly yours,

MISS M. G. BRAINARD, PRINCIPAL.
P. W. Scarch, Superintendent of Schools.

DEAR Sik: Our school work having met with so
many hindrances during the past year, we have not seen
the good results of our labor that we hoped for at the commencement of the vear. First, the lack of school accommodations in ward one sadly interfered with our work, but
patience had chance for perfect work in teachers, pupils
and parents. Schools were opened outside our building
and pupils came and went in our attempt to do justice to
all. Tater there was redivision of school lines and a
general upheaval in our building. Three of our teachers
were assigned to other buildings and three new ones took
their places. Former pupils left us and new ones came.

The last two months of the year saw earnest and constant work on the part of teachers and pupils and preparation for better and more extended work during the next
year.

NEEDS OF BRIDGE SPREET SCHOOL.

Slate blackbords, walls are cracked, yard fenced in
and seeded down, ventilation of closets attended to, double
windows on north side of the building, northwest room
cannot be heated in cold weather, window catches needed,
doors need fixing so that they can be locked, principal’s
room on the second floor very much needed, floors need
attention.

Mr. Preston VW". Search, Superintendent of. Schools. |
DEAR SIR: At the close of the last school year, June, |
 sixty, third grade pupils were expected to enter the ,
Hamilton street school as fourth grade pupils. But these
young Hamilton candidates were obliged to remain with |
us when the new school year opened on account of the in- :
creased number in Hamilton. This occasioned almost an
entire change in work among the teachers. It was decided
that each should keep her own room, but advance to the i
work of the next grade with her class of last year. Though |
the teachers were not desirous of change, they took up |
: the new work with kindly spirit.
) The increase of number in the first grade so crowded
the two schools devoted totha: work that in the fifth week
a new school was opened in two-story building close by.
Its upper story is held in reserve for future contingencies.
Miss J. V. O’Brien, graduate of the Westfield Normal
school, became the teacher.
We have done all specified work with an earnest desire to be successful, and have, think, reached good
standard. We have found in nature work much benefit |
and pleaures, and in botany the zeal of the present fourth

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
grade during last summer and autumn greatly astonished
their teachers, furnishing store of material for number as
well as language work, and stimulating desire to draw
only from the object.

: In equipment for work inthe school room, we need
two tables from four to four and one-half feet long, large
globe representing the surface of each hemisphere in relief, various reference books for teachers, supplementary
reading for fourth grade in the line of interesting biography
and history, and books of simple travel from which our
third grade may gain extended information concerning
homes, customs, and manners. We need also the crude
apparatus for teaching primary science.

Our building needs new floors. Several cases of serious hurt to bare feet occurred during the last summer.
Our ceilings are patched in some rooms, cracked and sagging in others. It would be agreeable to see something
more cleanly, substantial and safe. It would be economical, as well as ornamental, to place picture moulding
ineach room. The condition of the roof calls for attention. In measure, its leaks are the source of our dis| figured ceilings.

We earnestly ask to have suitable playground made
of our rear yard so that the pupils need not stand upon
the sidewalk or play in the street.

No system of ventilation has ever been put into our
building.

Respectfully submitted,
ELLEN S. MORGAN, Principal.

DWIGHT STREET SCHOOL.
MISS A. M. MORGAN, PRINCIPAL.

Truly this  world of changes and the Holyoke
schools are not exempt.

The overcrowded condition of the schools in this locality made it necessary to erect new building and the West
street grammar school is the result.

The Lyman street school was abandoned for day school
and on Sept.  the pupils were transferred to one of the
three buildings in this section, causing more or less interruption for while. However, we are now ina condition
to progress with our work.

The building was new to many of the teachers and
pupils, the former were almost strangers to each other,
there having been so many changes in the corps of this
section.

The building contains eight rooms, one devoted to
fourth grade work, two to third grade, two to second grade,
and three to first grade work.

Average membership for last term was, ,
 average attendance for last term was, ,
 .

The furniture in the main is good, one room was refitted with new during last term, but must call attention
to two rooms occupied by grade one children, in one it is
very poor and old, in the other the little folks will need to
grow rapidly to fit the furniture.

)

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  

The walls and ceilings are all in poor condition, both
need whitening, some of the ceilings should have special
attention, being in dangerous condition. )

All the black-boards need to be repaired, in one room
they are badly mutilated which interferes with their use.

Picture rails or mouldings are needed in all the rooms.

The number of closets is not sufficient for the building. That part of the building containing them should
be carried to the second floor and the number increased.

Cannot the yard on the south side be reserved for a
lawn? It would certainly be an improvement to the surroundings and pleasure to teachers and pupils.

The pupils of the Lyman street school took much pride
in speaking of their lawn, frequently designating it as
‘The Lyman School Park.’’

The fence is in bad condition; many of the posts will
soon refuse to do duty. The west side has been braced for
some time. '

The building contains some books beyond the use of
fourth grade which might do good service in the higher
grades of the evening schools.

Some furniture is stored in the basement, which, if
removed, will again give the room to Professor Eger’s
use.

A. M. MORGAN, Principal.

EWINGVILLE SCHOOL.
MISS MARY E. FORD, PRINCIPAL.
Mr. Search:
In response to your communication of January  th, I
will say that this building cannot be said to be in good
condition. The northeast corner is weak, and has had
to be propped up with timbers in the cellar. do not
know whether or not it is now safe. The floors in the
dressing rooms and upper roonis are of poor wood, that in
the upper room being of soft, splintery wood, and very
dusty. The walls and ceilings are dingy and cracked,
both these things being especially noticeable in the upper
room, which has never been whitened within my knowledge. The blackboards need another coat of paint. The
outer doors should have springs as they cannot be kept
closed before school and at recess and seriously affect the
temperature of the lower room.

The school furniture is good, having been put in new
about three years ago. We have molding table and a
sufficient supply of molders’ sand. Our charts, with the
exception of the music charts, are of my own construction
(with the co-operation of the pupils), the only printed
maps in out possession being wall maps of the hemispheres.

: For use in number work we have both dry and liquid
measures, foot rules, forms for solid measurements, and
tablets for surface measurements.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  

In reading we have sufficient supply of reading
books, but many of them are far from answering the requirements of modern ideas in reading.

We especially need more sanitary and convenient
arrangement of water closets, and an assurance of the
safety of the northeast corner of the building already
mentioned. We also need cases for the storing of specimens. We have no place for those now in our possession,
and it is useless to encourage their collection without a
place to store theni. Cases should likewise be provided
for books, both reference books for use of the teachers and
special books for the children.

We need works for practice in reading of more
modern character. would suggest something on history,
geography, nature, etc., and also of more literary character, books of such wording that the child mind wil! not
be so absorbed with words or stilted phrases as to be unable to unearth the thoughts expressed. There are to be
found, books of highly entertaining character, stories
with not too obtrusive morals, yet of character elevating
and inspiring both morally and intellectually. There
seems no good reason why children should not enjoy their
reading just as an adult enjoys good book.

May also suggest that in dealing with works which
appeal-to the imagination, nothing should be allowed
which will bring about confusion in the plastic young
mind as to the Deity, as stories of the multiplicity of gods
and goddesses are sure to do.

These personalities are often anything but models fit
to bring before young children, in their motives and
morals, yet are given the name of God, which children are
at other times taught to revere.

There are many fairy stories which are not only the
delight of any natural child, but contain, cunningly hidden, more of what is helpful to those for whom they are
intended than can be realized by those who have not made
a study of this subject.

 REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

In geography, feel that, considering the antiquated
textbooks in use, we have been doing very good work.
The old book was useful, merely, as foundation, the
actual lesson being developed in class. As we are about
beginning the use of new and improved book, we hope
for still better things.

In the other branches too, feel that we are doing
creasingly good work. This year we are for the first
time trying, in degree, department work, with good success so far. Miss Shine has language, and Miss Cavanaugh numbers for the building, while the principal
takes reading in all but the first grade. All other work
is in charge of the principal in the upper room, and Miss
Shine in the lower room, assisted each, by the assistant,
Miss Anna Cavanaugh, by an elastic arrangement.

The social atmosphere of our little society is very
favorable. In some cases it is almost impossible to keep
quarantined children away from school. There is great
enthusiasm in school occupations. |

The children, as rule, enjoy good health. They show
plainly to those in constant association with them, steady

improvement in character and self control. cannot say
that there is single discouraging case in the school.

We are badly hampered in the teaching of sanitary
laws, particularly those pertaining to cleanliness, by the
condition, of which the unsightliness is the least objectionable feature, not only of the walls, ceilings and woodwork, but also by the needlessly unclean condition of the
windows and the floors. The air is constantly dust laden,
though all reasonable care is exercised in the use of door
mats. This is crying evil against which my efforts have
availed little.

Few children received here have had the advantage
of kindergarten training, but  those cases the result has
been very satisfactory. The kindergarten methods here,
as in most modern schools, have commended themselves to
us, and had much influence in our work.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
I hesitate to speak of those eminently desirable occupations, needle work and manual training, as our time
is already so fully occupied and the building affords such
poor facilities. We are often much inconvenienced by the
lack of rooms, or room, into which it is possible to retire
either with classes doing work which conflicts with that
alre dy i- progress in the school oom, or when any of the
teachers need an opportunity for quiet work not immediately relating to the children. |
In the above have endeavored to make general
statement, meeting the requirements in your communication, and avoiding details. Hoping it will meet with your
approval, am sincerely,
-MARY E. FORD,
Principal, Ewingville School.

MISS AGNES E. KELLY, PRINCIPAL.
BUILDING. .

There are but two rooms in the building and the overflow is provided with room fitted up in the engine house.
The school at present needs three rooms and in the spring
will need another, possibly.

A large, empty basement under the north room  too
damp and cold to be used as play-room in bad weather,
or as work-room in any kind of weather. stove put in
this would dry and heat sufficiently to be used for either
or both purposes.

CLOSETS.

These are simply out-houses situated about thirty-five
feet in the rear of the school building. We would recommend that these out-houses be done away with and water
closets put inside the building, thus getting rid of the
odor in warm weather and the discomfort in cold weather.

FURNITURE.

The furniture is in very good condition but in need of
paint and varnish. The locks on the teachers’ desks are
in need of repair. book case or cup-board in each room
is needed.

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
GROUNDS.
The school house has been occupied for nearly four
years and nothing has been done by the city to improve
the grounds. The children have planted trees and shrubs
but there is no fence to keep out intruders and their work
- is. undone very quickly.

INGLESIDE SCHOOL.
|
MISS A. G. FLAHERTY, TEACHER. |
Mr. P. W. Search, Superintendent of Schools.
DEAR SIR: The present number of pupils of the
Ingleside school is twenty, taking in all the grades from
the first to the eighth. The plan of combining grades
has not been used because of lack of interest when the
children find they are not in one grade throughout. In
order to give all the time possible to each class, the progran for the grammar grades has been so arranged that
instead of having fifteen minutes class work daily it has a
half hour every other day.
Our library is necessarily small one, having begun
only last year and with so few children to help it on.
Books are taken regularly from the city library and placed
on the reading table. Two magazines are also furnisned—
Self Culture and the Educator. What we need most is
Webster’s dictionary and an encyclopedia. History is
begun in the sixth grade, not as regular study, but a
certain amount is to be looked up every week.
Much more time has been given this vear to music
and nature study. .
The stove which was in the middle of the room has
been removed and wasreplaced byafurnace. This method
gives better satisfaction because the heat is more evenly
distributed.
 
f

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  

Storm windows and weather strips on the doors are
absolutely necessary.

The only very cold day this winter it was impossible, ,
with good fire to get the temperature above fifty degrees.
The only thing to do was to close school for the day. The
children cannot occupy the seats near the north windows
because of the draughts that come from them. The
spaces between the doors and the flag stones are so wide
that when we have snow storm the passages are covered
with snow. new door is needed in the boys’ cellar to
take the place of one that has been patched by the boys 
and which lets in great deal of cold air. It was disappointment to find that the walls were not whitened
during the summer vacation. The janitor reports that a
good gale of wind will carry off the chimney. Yours very respectfully,
A. G. FLAHERTY.

REPORT OF TRUANT OFFICERS.
To the School Committee of the City of Holyoke.

GENTLEMEN :—We herewith present to your honorable
board our annual report for the year ending June ,
and we particularly call your attention to the statistical
part of it.

, CENSUS.

As has been the usual custom as well as the statutory
law, the census of the children between the ages of five
and fifteen years were enumerated by us during the months

of May and June.
: In order that the schools should not suffer on account
of the regular officers’ time being taken up with the census, the committee on census, attendance and truancy,
appointed Timothy Moriarty and Lawrence. F. Dowd as
special truant officers for the months of May and June.

The districts assigned for the census work was as follows: The senior officer had districts and Io,
and the junior officer, and  .

The number of children enumerated in the city between
five and fifteen years of age was  gain of over
the census of  .

While taking the school census we also took the population of the city. Our method in getting the population
was to inquire of each family the number of persons that
were living in their tenement and, placing the number so
reported on the margin of our books, thereby enabling us

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
to secure as correct census as possible without interfering in the least with the school census. We found the
number so reported to be  gain of over our
census of  and gain of over the state enumera- ,
tion of  .

The following tables show the school census by dis- ‘
tricts May May and May the
gain in each district in each of these years; also, the
number attending the public, private and parochial schools;
the number at work; and the number not at work, nor at

During the month of December,  we visited the
several manufacturing, mechanical and mercantile establishments and found that the employers were strictly
observing the law in relation to the employment of minors

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.  
between the ages of thirteen and sixteen., From Dec.  ,
 to Dec. the number of minors in the several
establishments in the city was  or less than were
eniployed between the corresponding dates and  .
The decrease was due to the shutting down of part of the
machinery in several mills, thereby giving an opportunity
to the minors to attend school. Few parents availed themselves of this opportunity-and sent them to school, but the
greater number was allowed to roam about the streets
leading the younger children to all sorts of disorders.

The foregoing table of contagious diseases shows that
the duties of the truant officers are not confined to looking
after the truants and absentees from school, but in great
measure to the sanitary condition of the city, in quarantining, under the direction of the city physician, of all places
where any contagious disease is found, and not allowing
the children in school, until all danger of contagion is past.

This work, we think, should be in charge of the board
of health and not that of truant officers, for considerable
time which might be used for school-work is taken up in
putting up cards and quarantining children.

As is shown by the table the number of cases of contagious diseases is great deal less this year than last.
Although there were few more cases of diphtheria, there
is marked decrease of other contagious diseases.

There were twenty-eight cases of diphtheria, affecting
seventy-six pupils half days, eleven cases of scarlet
fever, affecting thirty-one pupils half days, and only
one case of measles, affecting one pupil  half
days, while last year, there were fifteen cases of diptheria,
affecting thirty-two pupils half days, and twentythree cases of scarlet fever, affecting fifty-five pupils  
half days, and cases of measles, affecting pupils
  half days.

As the rules prescribe, we visit the city physician’s
office every day to ascertain if there have been any cases of
contagious diseases reported, and  there have been, we

IgO REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE.
prod to quarantine the family or families, as the nature
of disease may be, by placing card designating the disease
on the door or main entrance; if measles, we quarantine
only the family where the case is; if diphtheria or scarlet
fever, we quarantine all children of school age that use the
same entrance, until all danger of contagion is passed, as
the statutes require, viz.: two weeks after the death, removal or recovery of the patient. TRUANCY.

There were truants and truancies in the preceding year, while we reported truants and truancies
this year, which shows slight increase. The increase of
truancies was during the months of May and June, during
which time Messrs. Moriarty and Dowd had the charge of
looking after the school-work while we were taking the
school census, which shows that experience alone can remedy this evil. As it has been said in our last report, we
have not enough authority, and on the other hand it is
astonishing to find how many parents neglect their duty;
they do not care whether or not their children are at
school; another cause for truancy is that there are many
parents who work and cannot give to their children the
care needed.

Eleven warrants were issued by the court at the request of the school committee, from these eight have been
committed to the County Truant School, some for one,
others fortwo years. Three boys had their cases continued
from time to time and were finally discharged, as they were
evidently doing better, continuing regularly at school.

Seventeen boys were discharged from the truant school
during the year, twelve under recommendation of the
superintendent, and one whose parents moved out of the
city, the remainder were not released until the expiration
of their term of sentence.

We have now at the truant school under the supervision of Mr. Ward, the new superintendent, six boys, the

REPORT OF SCHOOL COMMITTEE. IQI
greater number of whom will be discharged during the
year of  .

In conclusion we wish to thank the committee, superintendent and teachers for their assistance, and we are
especially gratiful to the principals of the different buildings for their great efforts to aid us in the performance of
our duties.

Respectfully submitted,

HIGHWAYS AND BRIDGES. |

There has been no permanent work done on the streets
and highways during the past year and the bridges, with
one exception, have been allowed to rust and deteriorate.
This exception is the foot bridge over the Boston Maine

. REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.  
railroad at Dwight street, on which  was spent for
painting and  for repairs. Last February, your engineer, in special report, called your attention to the condition of the old wooden bridge over the second level canal
at Bridge street near the Valley Paper Co.’s mill. That
report was referred to the committee on highways and
bridges, where it was safely deposited in some obscure

; pigeon hole owing to lack of funds. now renew my recommendation that this bridge be replaced by substantial
structure of iron to correspond in width with the street.

The single span pin and link bridge over the third
level canal on Main street should also be replaced by new
bridge of sufficient strength and width to meet the requirements of heavy teaming and street cartrafic. The Holyoke
Street Railway Company agreed to pay one-half the cost
of new bridge over this canal when they accepted the
conditions of franchise granted them by the board of
aldermen of  .

Among the many bridges demanding care and attention, are the bridges across the Connecticut river at South
Hadley and Willimansett. The South Hadley bridge was
built in  and in the Willimansett bridge was
finished. As neither of these bridges has seen the painter’s
brush since they were constructed, they are now in sad
need of care. In addition to those above mentioned, there
are two bridges on Lyman street, two on Dwight street,
two on Appleton street, two on Cabot street, and one on
Sargeant street that require more or less repairing and
painting.

The condition of these bridges has been placed before
the government year after year, but no attention has been
paid to the recommendations. Very little heed ts paid to
bridges in any municipality until the danger limit  isreached.
Then there is mad rush and enormous expenditure to repair something that could have been repaired for comparatively small amount, if done when first recommended.
These bridges should receive your serious consideration.

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.
MACADAM ROADS.
That macadam is the proper material for roads and |
residential streets has been satisfactorily demonstrated in
several cities and towns in this Commonwealth. The ,
Massachusetts highway commission, composed of three
able professors who have devoted years to the study of road
making material, has shown its faith in macadam by constructing over one hundred miles of state road of this material. When men of the caliber of Prof. T. C. Mendenhall,
Prof. N. S. Shaler, and Engineer W. E. McClintock place
their stamp of approval upon macadam, no further argunent for its use  necessary.
Our limited experience with macadam has convinced
me that it would be economy for the city to abandon its
gravel banks and use macadam for ordinary road repair. ing. From observations made and records kept during the
year, am certain that macadam can be delivered upon
our streets at the price now paid for gravel.
If macadam roads are to take the place of our gravel
roads, and sincerely hope this will come to pass, it might |
be well for the city to own stone crushing plant. Sucha |
plant as would meet the requirements of growing young
city like Holyoke, would cost about With the great
amount of trap rock available within the city limits, this
question should be considered by the incoming board of
 public works.
STREET EXCAVATIONS.
There is nothing more aggravating, both to the general public and the city official, than to see recently
paved street opened up to gain access to underground
pipes, conduits, etc., and the pavement indifferently replaced, as has been the case in this city, time and time
again. The city official feels that his care and attention
to the preparation of specifications, the study and selection of materials, and to the exection of the work is only
|

ORE EDEL a
: ;
, REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.  
time wasted, and the general public feel that their money
is likewise wasted. In this city, persons who dig up streets
"are under no restriction whatever. There is no ordinance
. demanding them to replace quantities removed to their
, former condition, and onr streets plainly show the results.
: High street with its asphalt block pavement will be continuous series of ruts in few years unless immediate de, parture is taken from our present course. The city should
control all street excavations, and allow no person or corporation to dig up any street for any purpose unless suf, ficient assurance is given by said person or corporation, to
replace the same to the satisfaction of the board of public
works, or their superintendent.
PAVING RECOMMENDATIONS.
: Cabot street, between Canal and Race streets, should
be paved next year, and your engineer believes that vitrified brick is the proper pavement for this street. Vitrified
brick as pavement has many advantages over asphalt or
granite blocks. Asphalt blocks present beautiful, smooth
pavement, delightful for driving, easily hept clean, water
tight, preventing leakage through ground of street fluids
and filth, and in addition is noiseless; but very slippery
when wet. Granite blocks offer great resistance to traffic,
wear uneven and are very noisy. The uneven surface affords lodgment for filth and cannot possibly be kept clean.
Vitrified brick pavement is as noiseless as the asphalt and |
as pleasant to walk or drive upon, is not slippery, and af- |
fords better foothoid for horses, while its durability will ,
compare favorably with granite blocks. :
The following streets should be macadamized as soon :
as the necessary funds can be devoted to the purpose: !
Dwight street, from Elm to Linden.
Maple street, from Lyman to Essex.
Lyman street, from Main to Canal.

| STREET SIGNS. C
Every corner in the populated districts of the city i.
should be provided with street signs. Aluminum letters
on enameled background or plate, make very neat and
durable sign, and can be furnished and set up for about
one dollar each.
ic
MAPS FOR ASSESSORS. sca
Maps for the use of the assessors have been made from a
Register of Deeds records of all that portion of the city not
included in the contract with J. M. Sickman, C. E. This
comprises land on Northampton street, known as the Lawler tract, and land on same street owned by C. E. Ball,
John Cleary, Newton Allyn, Daniel O’Connell, Corser
& Arthur, and Chas. A. Corser; also land north of the
‘“Dingle’’ at Pleasant street, now owned by Whitcomb &
Pearsons, and land of Corser Arthur at Ingleside. This
work will hereafter be done by this department and trust Be
you will not under-estimate its value in making the appropriations.
HOUSE NUMBERING. .
This department has renumbered Laurel street, Lawler street, and Beacon avenue the past year, and assigned
forty-three numbers to houses upon request of owners. L
Numbers so assigned have been charged for where numbers have been furnished by this department. For this
purpose  has been received.
SIDEWALKS.
Under the direction of the committee on sidewalks, ,
  feet of curbing has been set, square yards of
new walk laid, and square yards of old walks recovered. For the sum of  the walks ot the Dwight
street bridge over the first level canal were recovered, and
the dangerous iron girders that run through the center of

the walks, were put where they will cause no more acci; dents. Had this been done year ago, the city would be
more than one thousand doJlars the richer.

SEWERS AND DRAINS..

Complaints of flooded cellars have been received from
thirteen parties between Essex street and Prospect street.
As these cellars are flooded but for few moments during

' |
wT
: REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER. ;
heavy rains, it is evident that the sewers are of sufficient
capacity to provide for ordinary demands, but incapable
of caring for storm water and house waste together. Sewer
after sewer has been dug up to be replaced by one of
greater capacity with the hope of preventing similar nuisances; but today we are no better off than before these
sewers were enlarged. The same nuisance exists in the
same localities, showing the policy of tearing up, and replacing sewers to provide for storm water, to be wrong. I
am most decidedly in favor of disposing of storm water by
separate system.

If permission is obtained from the Holyoke Water
Power Co., all surface water might be delivered into the
canals. When this policy is carried out there will be no
more flooded cellars. would therefore suggest that a
storm water sewer be run through Appleton street from }
Pleasant street to the first level canal, and that all catch ,
basins along the line  in number), be connected with
said sewer. This would relieve the Front street sewer,
and also the Walnut street sewer.

Exhaust pipes from four engines and pumps have
been ordered removed from sewers. Steam in sewers soon
causes disintegration and collapse, and the heat of steam
makes the malarial gases more active, while at the same
time it produces an amount of pressure that will force the
gas back into buildings through the water traps. Wherever sewer gas is forced back through buildings, you may
look for greatly increased death rate.  

The extensions to the sewerage systems during the |
year,  will be found concisely set forth inthetable
following, which includes, as far as can be ascertained from
department reports, all sewers built to December Ist,  .

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.  
CITY PROPERTY.
| ALMSHOUSE ADDITION.

This department has prepared plans and specifications
for two wing additions to the almshouse. Each wing 
feet by feet, three stories high. LalLiberte Bros. were
awarded the contract to build the additions for but
as the contract did not provide for finishing the third floor
this work should be finished next year. When complete,
the additions wili give fifty-four rooms and two wards to be
used in sickness. All excavating and grading was done
by the city and not included in the contract. The buildings are not complete and accepted, so detail report cannot
be given this vear.

CITY HALL CEILINGS.

Iron ceilings have been placed in the mayor’s office,
the superintendent of schools’ office, and the main corridor
of the city hall building under the direction of the committee on city property. Next year this work should be
continued as the present plaster cornices are daily falling
in small pieces and likely to cause damage if not replaced
by something more substantial. The work done last year
cost nearly cents per square foot.

SANITARIES AT NORTH CHESTNUT STREET SCHOOL.

' New sanitaries were placed in the North Chestnut
street school. Sullivan, Carmody Wesely did the work
under contract for .

HEATING AND VENTILATING NONOTUCK STREET SCHOOI..

On the roth of April,  the Fuller Warren Company, of Boston, contracted with the city property committee to heat and ventilate the Nonotuck street school
building for the sum of  ‘‘In case of failure and
notice of the same,’’ reads the contract, ‘‘ the party of the
first part (the company) shall have the option of making
said apparatus operate as agreed, or to remove the same,

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.

in case of which removal the party of the first part shall
refund the purchase money.”’ It was further agreed that
the contract would be completed August and that
all rooms would be comfortably heated in weather ro degrees (Fahrenheit) below zero.

In the opinion of your engineer, this contract has not
been carried out by the company. In June last, your engineer notified the Fuller Warren Company that the
apparatus failed to operate and requested them to attend
to it during the summer vacation. The company paid no
attention to the request and nothing has been heard from
them since, although they have received  on the contract. Every act of the company in this matter, leads me
to believe that they are not over anxious to complete the
work; that they have received money enough on the contract to pay all expenses and leave margin for profit, and
that they will not complete the contract unless compelled
todoso. This company should be forced to complete their
work or refund the money received, and to that end recommend that proper action be taken.

FIRE-PROOF VAULT. :

More adequate means of storing records of the several
offices are absolutely necessary. Every safe in the city

| hall is over-crowded and records are now filed in decidedly reckless manner. would therefore suggest that the ,
room in the basement of the city hall, now used by the
school committee for storing supplies, be made into fireproof vault, partitioned into sections for the different
offices.
GENERAL.
THE N. E. TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH CO.’S WORK.

Early in the spring the N. E. Telephone and Telegraph Company were granted permission to place their
wires under ground on Main street from Cabot to South
street, on Dwight street from Maple to School street, and

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.  
on School street from Dwight to Hampden street. The
work was done during the summer, and to the credit of the
company let it be said that their manner and method of
doing work and the conditionin which they left the streets
were entirely satisfactory to this department.

But it strikes me that this company is receiving gratis
valuable privileges from the city, and on the other hand
the city pays dearly for all it gets from the telephone company. recognize that telephones are indispensible in the
conduct of successful business, and of inestimable value
to the several city offices, and while we owe considerable
to the telephone company forthe prompt service we receive,
these same telephones would be worthless without the
street franchise connected with them, for which the telephone company pays nothing. With the growth of the
city, additional privileges will be petitioned for by the
telephone company, and recommend that each petition be
dropped into the waste basket until such time as the company will furnish the city, free of charge, all the the telephones the several departments may require.

The following table shows the location and amount
paid per month for each telephone the past year; also location of telephones on the free list:

I hereby certify that have examined the cash book

in hand to be thirty-one thousand, seven hundred fourteen
and forty-nine one-hundredths dollars ($ ), made

[Signed D. L. FARR,
Auditor.

In our last annual report we laid before you the fact
that we had done our utmost to make Ashley and Wrights
ponds, and likewise the Whiting Street reservoir yield
their full limit of water. We were convinced that they
were doing so; and yet we know now, better than ever,
that their fullest measure is not sufficient to satisfy our
wide-spreading and fast growing city. We told you then,
and we repeat it now, that we need more and purer water
than they can supply. .

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  

Our experience with the Legislature of when we
applied for permission to appropriate to our use the waters
of Munn’s brook, Granville, Mass., was given to you. We
acquainted you with our purpose to renew, during the past
year, our claim for another source of supply. We asked
your co-operation and we got it. We felt that if we had
your assistance justice would be done us. |

Accordingly we went to the Legislature of last year
with petition that they grant us the privelege of taking
‘‘the waters of the south westerly branch of the Manhan
river, for the purpose of supplying our people with pure
water for the extinguishment of fires and for domestic and
other purposes.’’ Our petition was favorably received and
acted upon as you will see, from perusal of the following
Act:

[CHAP.  ]
- AN ACT TO AUTHORIZE THE CITY OF HOLYOKE TO IN CREASE ITS WATER SUPPLY.
Be tt enacted, etc., as follows :

SECTION I. The city of Holyoke by its water com-,
missioners, for the purpose of supplying its inhabitants
with pure water for the extinguishment of fires and for
domestic and other purposes, may take by purchase or
otherwise and hold the waters of the southwesterly branch
of the Manhan river, at any point on said river, not more
than three thousand feet below the confluence of the
Tucker and Manhan brooks, in the town of Southampton,
also the waters of Tucker and Manhan brooks and the
springs connected therewith, and the water rights connected with such waters, and also all lands, rights of way
and easements necessary for holding and preserving such
water and for diverting and conducting the same into
Ashley’s and Wright’s ponds, so-called, in said city of
Holyoke, and also for conducting the same to any and all
parts of said city; and may erect upon the land thus ,
taken or held proper dams, buildings and other structures ,

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.

and may make excavations and provide such other means
and appliances as may be necessary for the establishment
and maintenance of complete and effective water works ;
and may construct and lay down conduits, pipes and other
works under or over any lands, water courses, railroads or
public or private ways, and along any such ways in such
manner as not unnecessarily to obstruct the same; and for
the purpose of constructing, maintaining and repairing the
same, and for all proper purposes of this act, said city may
dig up any such lands, and, under the direction of the
board of selectmen of the town in which said ways are situated, may enter upon and dig up any such ways, in such
manner as to cause the least hindrance to public travel on
such ways.

SECTION  The city of Holyoke shall, within sixty
days after the taking of any such lands, rights of way,
water rights, water courses or easements as aforesaid,
otherwise than by purchase, file and cause to be recorded
in the registry of deeds for the county in which the said
lands or other property are situated description thereof
sufficiently accurate for identification, with statement of
the purposes for which the same were taken, signed by the
water commissioners of said city.

SECTION  The city of Holyoke shall be liable to
pay all damages sustained by any persons or corporations in
their property by the taking of any lands, water, water :
sources, water rights, easements or other property, or by
the construction or repairing of any dams, aqueducts, or

} other works for the purposes aforesaid, or by the doing of
any other act or thing causing damage. If any person or
corporation sustaining damages as aforesaid cannot agree
with the city upon the amount of such damages they may
be assessed by the county commissioners for the counties
of Hampden and Hampshire in joint session, by the making of written application to said commissioners for the
assessment of damages within three years after such damages shall have been sustained and either party aggrieved

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
by the decision of said commissioners in the estimation of
said damages, may, upon application to the superior court

+ sitting within and for the county where said damages are
sustained, have the same assessed by jury, and if the
damages are increased by the jury said city shall pay all
legal costs, but otherwise said costs shall be paid by the
party claiming damages; and the said commissioners and
jury shall have the same powers, and the prodings shall
in all other respects be conducted in the same manner, as
provided in case of taking lands for highways.

SECTION  Said city may, for the purpose of paying
the necessary expenses and liabilities incurred under the
provisions of this act, issue from time to time bonds, notes
or scrip to an amount not exding in the aggregate three
hundred thousand dollars. Such bondg, notes or scrip
shall bear on their face the words, Holyoke Water Fund,

 shall be payable at the expiration of periods not exding
thirty years from the date of issue, shall bear interest payable semi-annually at rate not exding six per cent.
per annum, and shall be signed by the treasurer of the city
and be counter-signed by the water commissioners of said
city. Said city shall sell such securities at public or private sale, or pledge the same for money borrowed for the
purposes of this act, upon such terms and conditions as it
may deem proper, provided that such securities shall not
be sold for iess than the par value thereof. The city shall
provide at the time of contracting said loan for the establishment of sinking fund, and shall annually contribute
to such fund sum sufficient with the accumulations thereof to ‘pay the principal of said loan at maturity. The said
sinking fund shall remain inviolate and pledged to the pavyment of said loan and shall be used for no other purpose.
And such bonds, notes or scrip shall not be considered or
reckoned in ascertaining the limit of indebtedness of said
city under the provisions of chapter twenty-nine of the Public Statutes and of the acts in amendment thereof or in
addition thereto.

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD. |

SECTION  The city of Holyoke shall, when constructing its pipe line through the twon of Southampton,
place branch in said pipe line, not less than eight
inches in diameter, at its own expense, at such point as
may be designated by the selectmen of saidtown. If at any
time thereafter the town of Southampton shall vote to construct system of water works said town may connect its
pipes with that of the city of Holyoke at the branch
herein provided for, and draw from the pipe of the city of
Holyoke, without expence to said town, such quantity of
water as may be required by said town to supply its inhabitants with water for fire, domestic, and other purposes,

| except power, not exding one hundred and twenty-five
gallons per day for each inhabitant.

SECTION  The provisions of chapter sixty-two of the
acts of the year eighteen hundred and seventy-two shall
apply to this act, so far as the same are not in conflict herewith.

SECTION  This act shall take effect upon its passage.

. —[ Approved May .

As soon as this act had been duly approved we set
about developing the coveted stream. The first thing that
we did was to consider where an intake dam could be most
advantageously located. This was all-important because
we knew, from survey made by our engineers, that the
natural flow therefram would bring to our reservoirs some
  gallons of water each day, and this is more than

, we are presently consuming. The cost of bringing the
water hither, the quality of the material to be used, the
durability of construction, and the future needs of the city |
were all carefully kept under consideration before any decided step was taken. Here is an epitome of our deliberations and transactions thus far:

At first it seemed to us that low dam of or feet |
in height would be sufficient for us, but we afterwards

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
learned, from consultation with Engineers Tighe and McClintock, that dam feet high would be in every way
more advantageous to the city. We learned from them
that the higher dam would better regulate the flow of
water in the pipes, would protect them, and would save
each year from to gallons of water.
The difference in the cost of material and labor would not
be much, since it would be necessary to build the foundations of the dam strong and heavy enough to assume
future additions.

A full discussion of this new water supply, its location, the properties of the water, its suitableness and
adaptability will be found in the very full report of Engineer Tighe handed to our board Nov. .

This report shows beyond doubt that the system,
when developed, ‘‘will give thorough satisfaction and will
meet the approval of all those interested in the health of
the community and prosperity of the city at large.’’ This
repor& also contains the approval of the State Board of
Health.

Thus encouraged in our great project, we proded to
action, and in the latter part of August we closed contract with Fred T. Ley Co., of Springfield to construct
an intake reservoir with an earthen concrete core dam for
the approximate sum of This work was nearly
completed when the cold weather obliged us to defer the
finishing touches to early spring.

In October we closed contracts for tons of  -inch
cast iron pipe. The pipe market was favorable, and we
were, in consequence, enabled to make contracts with the
Warren Foundry and Machine Co. of Phillipsburg, N. J., |
for tons of such pipe at  per gross ton (f.  b.)
cars to Southampton, and with the National Foundry and
Pipe Works Limited, of Scottdale, Pa., for tons at
$  per gross ton, delivered at the same place.

The pipe is now being delivered and placed along the
pipe line. Contracts have also been made for tons of
lead at  per lbs.

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.

That we were able to make such favorable contracts,
we deem it worthy of congratulation, for we will thus be
able to complete our work ata cost much less than we had
at first estimated. Thus far we have paid  for all
the wo.k done to date; this amount includes whatsoever
we have paid for work on dam, and the payments on account of pipe and lead for main from Southampton to Ashley pond. |

The damages caused cannot at the present time be
named, nor can the amount of money to be paid for lands
taken in the vicinity be given, since there has been no final
settlement as yet made; but we have no fear that either
demand will be exorbitant, and we, therefore, hope for an
early and amicable settlement between us and all other
parties concerned. If, however, we say that  will
easily cover the whole cost of the work we will say all that
can possibly be said at the present moment.

With the advice and consent of your Honorable body
we have sold ($ yrs. per cent. Gold Water bonds. The money market was not in its steadiest mood
and yet we received for these bonds or 
premium; which sum, according to your direction, was
placed in sinking fund to go towards the payment of
these bonds when they mature.

This matter has indeed turned out as it should have.
That it would have most successful issue we were most
sure, and consequently, at the very beginning of the last
year, we took steps to put Ashley and Wright’s ponds in
condition to receive the new supply when it came; we
scraped and cleaned the edges.

We scraped and cleaned the edges on all sides of the

- ponds; the grass, weeds and brush were taken away, and
the muck and decayed vegetable matter which had therein
accumulated to great dimensions. were removed. In their
place we have put large quantities of gravel, which has
very much improved the water.

The old stone walls, which here and there had been

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
built along the sides of the ponds, have been torn down
and new ones have been laid to greater height. At the
culvert between the two ponds, the walls on both sides of
the road were relaid in cement, and an iron rail fence substituted for the useless wooden one.

The wooden fences made useless and ugly by old age
and weather have likewise given way to more beautiful
and substantial ones.

And the roads around and about the ponds have been
raised and widened, and they are now in good condition,
easy of travel and free from all danger. The culvert on the
west side of Ashley pond, south of the Tatro farm house,
where the main brooks from the mountain sides, pass
under the road, has been raised, extended, and the road
at this point widened. We have, moreover, bought the
Tatro farm, and we have thus increased our flowage area
and prevented all future pollution from that locality.

And now if we seem to have given ourselves solely to
the care of the Manhanriver and of the ponds, we beg to
remind you that we have by no means neglected the interests of the community at home; for, it is with pleasure to
ourselves and with congratulations to our fellow citizens
that we make mention of our purchase of the land and
buildings of the Holyoke Hydrant and Iron Works on
Commercial street. It was done for the sake of economy.
Heretofore we were obliged to give double handling to
our supplies on account of the distance of our yard and
store house from either of the railroads running into the
city. Now we are close by, indeed contiguous to, the
tracks of the Holyoke Westfield R. R. and we are thus
able to unload our supplies directly and immediately into
our yard and storehouse. These grounds and buildings
are spacious and of sufficient size to warrant our buying
our goods in larger quantities and consequently at lower
prices than when we were cramped by want of space as was
the case in our limited quarters at the rear of the high
school on Elm street.

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.

Another matter  which we have shown interest in
affairs at home was in improving the pressure of water in
the mains and at the same time our fire protection.

For these purposes we put in  -inch pipe on Hitchcock lane from the Merrick farm house to Northampton
street and thereon to Ball’s corner. On the same street
avain, south of South street, we laid  -inch main in
place of  -inch pipe which was in use there before.
Hydrants were put in convenient places on the same street,
and in other parts of Elmwood to better its condition in
time of fire.

The past year has indeed been prosperous year for
our department and we hope to have, before the close of the
ensuing year, the pure and wholesome water of the Manhan
river running into our healthy and beautiful Ashley and
Wrights ponds.

REPORT OF ENGINEER JAMES L. TIGHE.

HOLyOKE, MASs., November rith,  .
To the Board of Water Commissioners:

GENTLEMEN:—Since the General Court saw fit not to
graut you permission to increase the water supply of Holyoke by the addition of Munn’s brook, in Granville, I
again propose another scheme for increasing the water
supply, which if not so inexhaustible, or in every sense so

; good as the Granville scheme, is yet an excellent scheme,
and one which, believe, will on its development give
thorough satisfaction and meet the approval of all those
interested in the health of the community and general
prosperity of the city at large. The scheme thus referred
to, and which now place before you, is to take the upper
portion of the southwest branch ot the Manhan river and.

‘ convey its waters by gravitation into our distributing reservoirs in similar manner as was proposed in the Granville scheme. ;

, REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  

The southwest branch of the Manhan river rises in the
town of Westhampton and flows in southerly direction,
passing through the town of Southampton to the northern
boundary line of Westfield, where it turns very sharp
curve to the northeast, passing close to the village of
Southampton, thence toward the village of Easthampton,
within mile of which the north branch joins it, both
branches thus forming the Manhan river, which discharges
into the Oxbow, an elbow of the Connecticut, lying at the
foot of Mt. Nonotuck. The drainage area of the southwest branch contains square miles, and that of the
north branch square miles, while the whole of the
drainage area of the Manhan river contains square
miles.

The upper portion of the territory drained by the
southwest branch, which we propose to divert, is broken
and diversified with endless undulations, each receding hill
or ridge, as we go northward, rising higher than the one
before it until we reach the top of Mount Pisgah, which
stands feet above the level of the sea, or nearly  
feet higher than ourown Olympus, Mt. Tom. Hereonthe
summit of Mt. Pisgah is the farthest point north that the
watershed of the southwest branch extends, while on the
west it is bounded by Norwich hill, Horse hill, and Bungy
hill, and on the east by Cub hill, Red Oak hill, and Pomeroy mountain, of tragic fame in the days of Indian warfare. Within these bounds are several brooks and rivulets,
winding in all directions, through gorge and valley, forming here and there minature cascades as the water tumbles
over precipiees of granite and gneissic rock, of which the
strata of the earth in this region are composed.

Of these small streams there are two, much larger than
the rest, into which the smaller ones discharge, and which
are known as the Tucker and the Manhan brook. The
Manhan brook rises at the foot of Mt. Pisgah and flows
almost due south for distance of over six miles, where
Tucker’s brook, which rises at the foot of Norwich hill and

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.

flows also southward, gradually converges, after passing
Breakneck hill, towards the Manhan, which it joins ata
point in Southampton within few hundred yards of the
Montgomery boundary line. The stream formed by the
confluence of those two brooks is known as the southwest
branch of the Manhan river, and here at this point of confluence, or short distance below it, we propose to divert
the river and convey it by gravitation into our distributing
reservoir, Ashley pond. To do this conduit or conduits
of such material and of such capacity will have to be laid
as will render the best possible service and at the same
time agree with the greatest possible economy.

The area of watershead, above this point of confluence,
is about square miles, the average yield of which, taking series of years together, is, according to the expertence of other watersheds in this state, at least of
gallons perday. How much of this can be made available
depends almost entirely upon what storage we can furnish
by the construction of reservoirs to impound the waters of
the seasons of maximum yield for distribution in the seasons
of minimum yield. But before entering into any discussion
about the quantity which can be made available from the
whole or part of this watershed, or what quantity by which
it would be economical to increase the water supply at
present, it might be as well to state the general conditions
necessary for public water supply, which cannot do |
better than repeat the same as what is statod in the report
on the Granville water scheme, namely: First, that the
water is pure and wholesome, and of that quality best
adapted to domestic and industrial uses. Second, that the
supply be abundant in quantity, and so regulated as to
render the greatest possible assurance of life and property
against conflagrations.

According to the first condition we see that the water
must not only be pure and wholesome for drinking purposes, but must also be of that quality best adapted to
domestic and industrial uses, that is, it must not contain

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
any of those minerals or salts in solution, so inimical to
washing, or to boilers, or any other use it may be put toin
the industrial arts, where pure water is of the greatest consequence. The second condition tells us that the supply
should be abundant in quantity, and so regulated as to
render the greatest possible assurance of life and property
against conflagrations, that is, it should give the greatest
possible protection against fire, that ruthless destroyer of
life and property all over the world, but more especially in

- this country where, unfortunately, it  not uncommon to
see buildings, streets, and even whole sections of city,
worth millions of dollars, razed to the ground and left in a
state of chaos by this powerful agent of destruction, in
asingle day. To fulfill those conditions to the letter and
exercise the greatest economy in doing so was the aim in
view when the Granville water scheme was proposed. But
since that ideal supply was denied by the General Court,
the only alternative left was to seek some other supply
where the same conditions,  possible, can be fulfilled, or
nearly fulfilled where the same economy in its development
can be exercised.

Since the first condition requires pure and wholesome
water, it is absolutely necessary that the source of supply
should be free from all pollution and contamination, and |
from those minerals so deleterious to its uses in the household and in the industrial arts.

To have water supply free from pollution, it is at the
first essentially necessary to draw it from pure source, for
if taken from an impure source artificial means must be
used to remove all the elements of pollution, which is usually done by subjecting the water to an artificial process of
filtration, means occasionally used in public water supplies where no steps can be taken to prevent the pollution

of the source.

But allowing that polluted waters can be made pure
and wholesomie by the process of filtration, still can it be
considered so safe for use after being subjected to this arti  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.

ficial means as water taken from source free from such
pollution? Surely not, for it is evident should anything .
go wrong with the filtering process the results desired
would not be attained, and the water would pass in its
original state through the pipes to the household, there
endangering the health ‘of the family and the community

at large. From this we see how necessary it is to draw
water, used for public water supplies, from pure source,
and where there  the least danger of it becoming polluted

at any future time.

Sources of water supply may be divided into two
kinds, those which are drawn from ponds, lakes and
streams, known as surface waters, and others which are
drawn from beneath the crust of the earth and known as

‘ ground water supplies. Surface waters are more commonly used in public water supplies, although it is generally believed that ground waters, when pure, are the most
wholesome and best waters for drinking and domestic purposes. However, ground waters of hard nature having
salts and other minerals in solution, whose source underlies, or adjoins, populated district, where polluted waters
from cesspools entering the earth might find their way to
the ground supply, must in every case be looked upon
with suspicion, no matter what analyses may state as to
the thorough filtration and purity of the water. Ground
water supples, of moderate depth below the surface of the }
ground, are generally fed from the surface waters falling
on the shed above them, hence it is as necessary to use the

: same care and judgment in their selection asif those waters
were drawn directly from the surface. Why it is that
ground waters are not more commonly used throughout
the country is chiefly due to their uncertainty of furnishing
large supplies, and also due to the great expense of maintenance. }

Surface waters, when not polluted or contaminated
with foreign matter, either in solutions or suspension,
make excellent water supplies. That this shall be the



REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
case their source must lie in sparsely populated districts
where the land is poor, free from swamps, and unfit for
agricultural purposes. But this is not enough, for the
strata of the earth, throughout the same region, into which
water percolates to issue forth again at lower level in the
form of springs, must not contain any of those salts and
sulphates, which enter into combination with the water |
and prove injurious to its character. Of those salts, lime
and magnesia are some of the worst, and water drawn
from sheds where either is found in any quantity is wholly
unfit for use in boilers, washing and other domestic purposes. Besides magnesia, salts in water are considered to
be the cause of goitre, or swelling in the throat, very
common disease in Switzerland and other countries, owing, it is believed, to the abnormal amount of magnesia
found in the waters of these countries. Therefore, in
choosing source of water supply we must not only have
the shed free from all kinds of contamination, but also be
sure that it contains none of those salts, orsulphates, so
injurious to the quality of the water drawn therefrom.

The most favorable strata underlying the source
from which large water supply can be drawn are composed of the granites, gneisses, micas and sandstones.
Hence it  that the best sources of water supply are found
in regions where the strata consists of these and where the .
population is sparse and the land poor and of little benefit
for agricultural purposes.

If this is the case, our proposed source meets those
requirements, as the strata underlying the watershed are
of granitic nature. The population is there not more
than inhabitants to the square mile and from the occasional homestead seen in such state of dilapitation without any new one to replace it, gives at once the idea that
there is not only natural decrease of population, but also
large depreciation in the value of property througout the
district.

By far the greater portion of this mountainous water  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.

shed of Manhan and Tucker brooks is woodland, while the —
remainder, especially that in the valleys, is in pasture
with an occasional mixture of tillage and meadow land.
The soil throughout is shallow, out of which project
stones and rock in bold relief, while on its surface are
scattered all over, huge boulders to remind as it were the
geologist of the glacial period.

A short distance above the confluence of the Tucker
and Manhan brooks on the western bank of the former isa
gneissic quarry, while about mile above the same point
on the Manhan brook is situated granite quarry of ex- cellent quality from which stone has been taken for the
construction of that portion of the New York, New Haven
& Northampton railway running between Westfield and
Northampton. This quarry will be of inestimable value
in the construction of the new water system. On both
‘Tucker and Manhan brooks there are several sites for storage reservoirs. ‘Two of the most important shall mention
here, one being located at the confluence of the brooks and
the other about mile and half above on the Manhan
brook. This latter site lies in both South and Westhampton and can be developed to impound an abundant quantity of water at comparatively small outlay. According
to measurements made, dam thrown across the stream  

feet in height with an average length of feet at point
where the slopes of the Manhan valley converge into ‘
- narrow gorge and where the road leading from Russellville
to Westhampton crosses the brook would impound  
millons of gallons over surface area of acres.

The sides of this proposed reservoir are steep slopes
composed of either gravel or rock ledge, clothed here and

' there with trees and shrubs, while its bed, with the exception of about an acre and half of dead land tending to
swampiness, is pasture and meadow land having hard
gravelly bottom or sub-soil. The reservoir site at the con fluence if developed would require much greater outlay
by reason of much longer dam which would have to be
constructed. |

i

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  

However, since no reservoir will be needed here, except an intake, until the population of Holyoke is double
or treble what it is at present, it is unnecessary to go into
‘any detail about it in this report, further than to point out
the possibility of its development at any future time by
raising dam to any height within the limits of practice,
thus making storage reservoir of vast capacity.

It is quite possible that to all observations and appearances the source of water supply may be everything desired of it, yet the water may be unhealthy and unfit for
human and domestic uses. It may contain those disagreeable salts in solution before mentioned, or it may be contaminated only so far as not to be unpalatable or sensible
to our observations, but still dangerous for drinking purposes.

That this very important point may be in no wise
obscure, the water should always be subjected to chemical analysis which determines the amount of mineral and
organic matter in it, and, as far as possible, the condition
of the organic matter, whether in state of decomposition
or partially mineralized. Although this test of chemically

analyzing water to find its composition, goes but short
way in determining the wholesomeness of the water, yet it
points out those products found in unwholesome waters. :
For instance, if by analysis we find an abnormal amount
of chlorides and ammonias in water we may be pretty
sure of that water being polluted by sewage. Of the various products found in all surface waters by chemical analysis the ammonias, nitrates and chlorides are what generally tell the character of the water. High ammonias in
water, whether free or in the albuminoid state, indicate
that the water contains much organic matter which may
come from animal or vegetable decomposition or from sewage. The chlorides, given as chlorine, if found in water
to any extent above the amount found in waters in the
same locality, distinctly indicate pollution from sewage or
the waters of cesspools which find their way directly or by

  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.

filtration through the earth into the water. Nitrites show
that the organic matter in water is still in state of decomposition, while the nitrates show its full mineralization.
From this we see that high nitrates in water, although perfectly harmless, indicate decomposition of organic matter
at some time in the water. Much iron in water is ruinous
to it as it makes it hard, and if in greater quantity than’
.O parts will on oxidation with the air form a
rusty precipitate.

The appearance of water, that is, its turbidity or color,
depends to great extent on the nature of the soil beneath
the source, color being derived from dissolved leaves,
grasses, peat and swamps, while turbidity is caused by
dissolved clay, sewage or algze in the water. All surface
waters contain more or less organic products in state of
decomposition, and the great point is what proportton of
these products should indicate water impure for drinking
purposes.

This is just what we cannot decide, for some waters
containing high ammonias and high nitrites and nitrates
are known by experience not to be unwholesome waters.
However, be this as it may, water containing much free or
much albuminoid ammonia together with high chlorides
and nitrites must always be looked upon with suspicion,
especially if the amonnt of chlorine is abnormal, as this
distinctly indicates pollution by sewage if chlorine cannot
be otherwise shown to come from some natural cause such
as from the sea or from salt mines. The analysis made by
the State Board of Health in August last of both Manhan
and Tucker brooks, insert in the following table, together
with the analyses made two years ago of Munn’s brook in
Granville, Westfield, Little river, Bachelor’s brook in
Granby and Hampden ponds.

 REPORT OF WATER BOARD.
As we'see, the proportions of the ammonais and nitrates in Manhan and Tucker brooks are quite small as
are all the other products, except the chlorine in the latter, which stands few points above the normal amount
found in that section of the state, possibly indicating a
very slight pollution which the stream may receive from
the wastes of barn or cesspool entering it at some point
in its course. This can be very easily remedied by removing altogether those wastes or by diverting them to some
point from which they cannot enter the stream except by a
thorough filtration through the earth. Considering the
analyses of those two brooks, as whole, there is no
reason to think otherwise, but their waters will be wholesome for public supply, and judging from their quality
as to hardness and the very small amount of iron which
they contain will be well adapted to domestic and industrial uses.
Therefore agreed that this proposed source is good
one and that its waters qualify the requirements for a
healthy water supply. The next point to be discussed is
whether it will be found abundant in quantity. This we
take for granted, on account of the large area of the watershed, which, as is already stated, will yield, taking series
of years together, an average of thirteen millions of gallons per day. This is one million of gallons per day to the
square mile of shed, but there are few sheds upon which ,
storagé could be furnished within reasonable cost to render the full yield available, and or gallons
per day to the square mile is considered almost the’ maxi] mum yield that can be made available in this state from
| watersheds of any considerable size. To make available
at present even this latter quantity from this new source as
an increase for Holyoke would be foolish expenditure,
since it would be conveying far larger quantity of water
to our distributing reservoirs than would be needed for
several years or perhaps forever if our city should not continue its growth. But, assuming that Holyoke will conREPORT OF WATER BOARD.  
tinue increasing in population for at least the next forty
years, the probable population then will, according to the
table given by Mr. McClintock, consulting engineer, in his
report made on the new water supply for Holyoke two
years ago, be go, , and the quantity necessary to supply
this population will be per day, or of
gallons per day beyond what the city is using at present.
Taking for granted that this is correct and also that it |
would not be economical to expend large outlay developing new supply where at least five millions of gallons
per day could not eventually be made available, we now
prod to device ways and means that such can be accomplished.

As was stated in the beginning, the scheme proposed
is to divert the head waters of the southwest branch of the
Manhan river at the point of confluence or short distance
below it of the Manhan and Tucker brooks, and convey
them by gravitation into Ashley pond. The elevation at
this proposed point is feet higher than high wate,
mark at Ashley pond, or feet higher than the Holyoke
dam. Withthis difference of elevation, or in other words
with this feet head, clearcast iron pipe inches in
diameter and miles in length will convey millions
of gallons per day into Ashley ponds, or millions if we
allow per cent. loss caused by tubercles or incrustations
which may or may not come in time on the interior of the
pipe, while  -inch pipe of the same length will discharge eight millions into the same reservoir, or six millions  llowing the same percentage of loss for incrustations |
or tubercles asin the  -inch pipe. From this we see that
the small size of pipe is of sufficient capacity to increase
the present supply to over gallons per day, or in
other words, to render sufficient supply for Holyoke during the next quarter of century.

The shortest distance from the head waters which
supply Ashley ponds to the confluence of the Manhan and
Tucker brooks is only miles, but owing to the moun  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.
tain ridge that lies between the two places it would not be
practicable to bring the pipe line straight across from the
intake at the confluence to the point of discharge. On this
account the course of the pipe line will be roundabout
one, running first from the intake along the public thoroughfare to the hamlet of Russellville, thence southeasterly to the notch in the mountain range, where it will turn
 an angle and then follow in straight line to Ashey pond.
I may add here that measurements wers taken all over the
mountain range with view of conducting the pipe line
across it, but such plan is impracticable unless deep
cut or tunnel be made. which, as was seen, would incur an
expense so vast that  was unnecessary to calculate it.
While this yield from the source of the proposed supply will average in years of average rainfall not less than
ten millions of gallons per day, and in years of minimum
rainfall not less than six millions of gallons per day, yet
there will be some months of those years of both average
and minimum rainfall when the yield will not be much
. greater than one millionof gallons per day. The monthly
guagings ofthe yield, Sudbury river watershed, Boston, for
a very long period of years, furnish us with the best records
on which to base the yield of other watersheds all over the
state. Hence itis that take the yield of the two driest
years of that shed and upon this basis compute and tabulate what the yield would be in like years of the thirteen
square miles of area comprising the Manhan and Tucker
sheds.

According to this table we see that the yield of the
driest month, in year similar to  would only be
  gallons per day, or gallons per day to the
square mile of shed, and in vear similar to ,  gallons per day, or gallons per day to the
square mile of shed. We likewise see that the yield during, what is termed the dry weather flow, which extends

secutive months in the other, would only average two and
one-half millions of gallons per day and gallons
per day, while inthe remaining months the average yield
in either year would be far greater than would be necessary
to supply  even  -inch main. Since this is the
case, to secure an average daily yield the plan would be to
impound in storage reservoir, or reservoirs, the surplus
of the months of maximum yield for distribution in the
months of minimum yield. Butif it would be the more
economical, at first, to only make available quantity
sufficient to supply Holyoke, say for not less than the next
eighteen years, that is to increase the supply of Holyoke
by the addition of about two and one-half millions of gallons per day, the natural flow of the Manhan and Tucker
brooks, discharged through  -inch cast iron main,
would on an average discharge this quantity, while  inch main would require storage of millions of gallons. reservoir of this capacity can be constructed on
the site mentioned before, on the Manhan brook, atan outlay not exding but since greater storage
reservoir might be needed later, it would, believe, be
more econoniical to develop the full capacity of this reservoir at the outset. To do this would cause an expenditure
estimated at  of which being allowed for
stripping the loam off the sides and bottom of the reservoir. Again, since  -inch main, without storage, will
deliver, on the average, from the new source in the driest ‘
years gallons daily into Ashley pond, an additional quantity sufficient to meet the demands of Holyoke
for the next years, no storage will be needed until the
end of that time, thatis in  when, it is estimated, the

including storage and damages to mill privileges, are

enough of money fourteen years hence to build storage

for years, while the  -inch main, without storage, will
only supply Holyoke for years. ‘There are other reasons, too, why the  -inch main would be the more economical one, viz.: That years hence, we should be better
able to judge what the future growth of Holyoke would
be, and therefore, be better able to plan for its future needs.
That Holyoke may not increase in population so fast as
we now calculate, and that  -inch main, with storage,
may serve for  or years. That in case larger
main is needed than  -inch, at the end of years, or
even at the end of years, second  -inch main can be

capacity would be per cent. greater than the  -inch

of Holyoke until her population is  .

Granted then, that the proposed new supply will be a

OFFICE OF THE STATE BOARD OF HEALTH,
STATE HovuskE, BosTon, January .
To the Water Commissioners,
Holyoke, Massachusetts.

GENTLEMEN :—The State board of Health received
from you on November an application with reference to proposed additional water supply for the city of
Holyoke, to be taken from the southwest branch of the |
Manhan river at point just below the confluence of the |
Manhan and Tucker brooks, about miles above the village of Russellville in the town of Southampton. You
propose at first to divert the natural flow of the brook
through  -inch or  .inch pipe into Ashley pond, one of
your present sources of supply, by gravity, and subsequently when the increase in the use of water by the city
makes necessary larger supply than the natural flow
of the brook will furnish in connection with present sources,
you propose to construct storage reservoirs at favorable
sites upon the stream and its tributaries.

REPORT OF WATER BOARD.  

Your investigations with reference to storage reservoirs
upon the watershed of the proposed source indicate that a
reservoir of capacity of about gallons can be
constructed on the Manhan brook, about miles above .
its junction with Tucker brook, and that another reservoir
of large capacity can be constructed at the junction of
Manhan and Tucker brooks.

The board has caused an examination of the proposed
source of supply to be made and samples of the water sent
by you to be analyzed. ‘These analyses indicate that the
water of the proposed source is soft and otherwise of good
quality for domestic use.

This watershed when developed by the construction
of storage reservoirs at the sites indicated, will, in connection with your present sources, furnish sufficient supply :
for the city for very long time in the future at the present
rate of increase in population if the consumpton of water
does not exd about go gallons per inhabitant. :

The taking of the proposed source by Holyoke does
not appear to conflict with the interests of other growing
communities in the vicinity so far as the future water
supply of these places is concerned, and the source is an
appropriate one for additional water supply for Holyoke.

The question as to the size of pipe to be used for conveying water from the southwest branch of the Manhan
river to Ashley lake is largely one of cost and depends to
a considerable extent upon the future growth of the city.
If the city should continue to grow for many years in the
future at about the same rate that its past growth seems to
indicate, there will probably be little difference in the ultimate cost whether  -inch or  -inch pipe is used. If the
increase in population and in the use of water should be
less rapid in the future than in the past,  -inch pipe
would probably be somewhat more economical.

There is an advantage in the use of the larger pipe,
however, in that, even before its full capacity  required
to prevent shortage of water, it would be of great advan  REPORT OF WATER BOARD.
tage in filling the present ponds and reservoirs in the
spring, keeping them at higher level in the summer and
maintaining better quality of water.
By order of the Board,
