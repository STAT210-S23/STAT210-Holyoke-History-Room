REPORT OF THE

Fire Commissioners
Holyoke Fire Commission, December .
To THE HonoraBLE Mayor AND BOARD OF ALDERMEN:

Gentlemen: We respectfully submit to you the report
of the activities of the Holyoke Fire Department for the
year ending November in accordance with the requirements of the Ordinances of the City of Holyoke.

The Board of Fire Commissioners met January  th to
organize. The Board consisted of Thomas J. Carmody,
George W. Doane, Jr., and H. O. Beauchamp. Thomas J.
Carmody was elected Chairman, but declined to accept.
George W. Doane, Jr., was then elected Chairman and H.  .
Beauchamp was elected Vice-Chairman. John Hildreth was
elected Secretary. |

On March  th, David Clark was appointed to the Commission in place of Mr. Carmody, who had resigned. On

November  th, Chairman Doane was removed, and on
November Sth, Vice-Chairman Beauchamp resigned.

The year marks the passing of Judge Hildreth as
Secretary of the Board, position which he faithfully held
for twenty-seven years. On April  rd, James E. O’Leary
was appointed Secretary of the Fire Commission and Clerk
of the department under the rules of the Civil Service Commission.

There have been fires and alarms during the past
year, which shows marked decrease, being less than

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS  
the previous year. The losses on buildings amounted to
$ and the losses on contents making a
total fire loss of an increase of  over
last year. The value of property endangered by fire was
$ and the insurance on said property amounted
to The Insurance Companies paid claims to
the amount of leaving net loss of ,
an average of  on each fire.

The largest fires during were as follows:

Second Congregational Church .............. 
William F. Whiting Barns .................. )

In the fire at the Whiting Farm, head of cattle died,
and in the fire at M. E. O’Neill’s stable, Michael O’Connor
and horses lost their lives.

We wish to congratulate Chief Hurley for the capable
manner in which the duties of his office were conducted, and
for the efficient manner in which he and the officers and men
under him performed their duties. The many letters of
commendations received during the past year, which were
often accompanied by sizable checks for the Firemen’s Aid,
shows the appreciation felt by the citizens of Holyoke.

This year marks the installation of the two-platoon
system in our department. From our experience with it
during the past year we are convinced that it was very
wise move of the voters of: Holyoke as it has increased the
efficiency of the department, besides greatly improving the
living conditions of the men.

The two pieces of apparatus that were contracted for
in were received this year. The Seagrave Dispatch
Wagon replaced the old Dispatch Wagon at the Central
Station, and the Ahrens-Fox, gallon Triple Combination
Pumper was placed at the Highland Engine House. The
department is completely motorized with the exception of —
the two service trucks, one at the Highland Station, and one

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS
at the Elmwood Station. new Cadillac car was purchased
for the Chief at cost of .

Seven persons lost their lives by fire during the year.

- Three of these died at Fires to which the department was
not called.
Meroslow Samborok, Walnut Street, December 
Frank Jaracz, Walnut Street, December 
Mrs. Henry Beauchemin, West Street, February 
Rosemond Beauchemin, West Street, February 
Viola Gobiele, West Street, February 
Michael Connors, Lyman Street, May 
Vincent B. Lingley, Commercial Street, November .
The annual inspection and exhibition was held October
 th in front of the Central Station. Despite the heavy
wind that prevailed, remarkable exhibition of streams was
displayed, in which the members of both platoons took part.
The City Solicitor, who represented the Mayor, members of
the Board of Aldermen, and other city officials were present
and viewed the men and apparatus.

The Board of Fire Commissioners have granted every
member of the department substantial increase in pay during the past year. rule was made that firemen shall not
lose pay for time lost during sickness, provided that they
furnish doctor’s certificate.

We wish to call the matter of fires set by boys to the
attention of the teachers and principals of the schools of
Holyoke, and ask their co-operation in an effort to bring that
misdemeanor to an end. There were fires set by boys
during the year, as against last year and the year before. These fires often cause the loss of much valuable
property, and sometimes the loss of life. While there has
been an improvement shown in the matter of ringing false
alarms, we feel that there is much room for more improvement. It should always be kept in mind that every time
an alarm is received, the lives of seore or more of firemen

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS  
are endangered. There were false alarms during the
year.

We wish to caution the citizens of Holyoke about carelessness. One hundred and forty fires during the year may be
attributed to carelessness, such as: throwing cigarette butts
away carelessly, hot ashes, burning grass, leaves, ete. It should )
be drawn to their attention that any person setting fire
within the city limits between March  st and December Ist,
without permission of the Fire Commissioners or the Chief
of the Department, is liable to fine of or month in
prison, or both. |

The following recommendations are respectfully submitted, and we trust they will meet with your approval:

First: We recommend the purchase of two Hook and
Ladder Service Trucks, one to be placed in Elmwood, and
the other at the Highland Station. This will completely
motorize the department, and enable us to dispose of our
horses. Upon investigation, it will be found that all Fire
Departments throughout this seetion have replaced their
horse-drawn apparatus with motor driven apparatus. Aside
from the sanitary standpoint, it should be remembered that
motor-driven apparatus is much more effective and economieal, especially in the above named stations, as they are
seldom called to fire. The cost to keep horses is the same
under all conditions, whereas, where an automobile remains
idle, it costs nothing to maintain it.

Second: We recommend that the apparatus floors in all
the stations except the Central Station be laid in concrete.
This is necessary owing to the fact that there is at least one
piece of motor-driven apparatus in each stetion, and it is a
requirement of the garage laws of the State that floors upon which automobiles are kept must be made of concrete. This
would be an economic?! measure, as wooden floors have to

 

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS
be renewed and repaired constantly, on account of the constant washing of cars on them.

Three: We again renew our recommendation that
Station No. in Ward be completely overhauled, as the
sanitary and living conditions there are very poor. This is
one of the oldest stations in the city, and when built, no
plans were made for sleeping or living quarters. All the
houses have been arranged to meet the requirements of the
up-to-date fire station, and the need for overhauling is urgent.
Motor apparatus has been installed in this station which has
displaced the four horses that were formerly stationed there.
This leaves four stalls which should be removed, and the
Space occupied by them used for some advantageous purpose.

Four: We also recommend that the barn in Station
No. in South Holyoke be overhauled, as there is consid‘erable floor space in that station that could be used to better
advantage than at present.

Five: We recommend that there should be special
eppropriation of  for cable extensions, test posts and
‘street signals.

Six: We recommend that special appropriation of
‘$  be made for the purchase of new hose. Every year
dt is necessary to condemn large quantity of hose which
must be replaced.

Seven: We again recommend that the traffic rules be
amended so that street cars shall stop on the near side of
the streets. The Fire Department is very much interested
in this matter on the ground of public safety. Many serious
accidents that have occurred would have been avoided if this

) rule had been changed. :

We regret to report that we have lost two
men by death during the past year, viz.:
William J. Mays, who was appointed January  th,  and who died February .
Michael H. Gilligan, who was appointed
December  th,  and who died February

. FIRE ALARM TELEGRAPH

This department is in very good condition, except for
the matter of old fire alarm boxes that have been mentioned
in the reports of previous years. Some of these boxes have
been in service for thirty years, and are consequently out of
date and unsafe.

The value of the equipment is about .

HORSES

At present, we have six horses, two of which have been
loaned to the Board of Public Works. Seven horses were
sold at auction during the year. With the purchase of the
two pieces of apparatus mentioned in our recommendations,
we will be able to dispense with those remaining.

HAY AND FEED

We have not kept great deal of hay or feed on hand.
on account of the high cost. We purchase about month's
supply at time. 

HOSE

We have feet of inch hose in the department,
  feet of which is good hose. We also have feet of
three inch hose, all of which is in good condition.

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS  
The hose is divided among the different houses as follows:

During the past year we purchased feet of hose,
  feet being three inch hose. We need at least fect
for the coming year. We have given considerable of the
condemned hose to the Board of Public Works, which has
been saving to their department.
HOUSES
The houses are in good condition with the exceptions as
Stated in the recommendations.
DRILL SCHOOL
Drill school was conducted during the summer months
by First Deputy Chief McLean. As the two-platoon system required the addition of seventeen new men, the necessity of a
drill school was greater than ever before, and we wish to congratulate Deputy Chief McLean for the very creditable
results he obtained.

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS
INSPECTIONS
We regret to state that, owing to the installation of the

two-platoon system, the department was unable to devote

, much time to inspections this year, but are pleased to say
that corp of Insurance Engineers, who made survey of
the city in October of this year, reported to the department
that the conditions in Holyoke were the best of any they had
inspected. This indicates that the citizens are interested, and
are co-operating with the department in their effort to reduce the fire hazard.

ANNUAL REPORT OF
 ]
Board of Public Works.
To THE HONORABLE, THE MAyor AND MEMBERS OF THE BOARD
OF ALDERMEN OF THE City oF HOLYOKE, Mass.

Gentlemen: The Board submits herewith the annual report of the departments for the year ending November  ,
 .

The total credits from all sources in the departments
under the control of the Board for the year were six hundred sixty-four thousand four hundred seventy-four dollars
and thirty-eight cents ($ the total appropriations
from loans were two hundred ninety-five thousand dollars
($ the original appropriations from taxation were
three hundred twenty thousand eight hundred sixty dollars
($ ). Transfers were made to the various departments acting as additional appropriations of twenty-five thousand
six hundred seventy-four dollars and  fifty-three cents
($ and service transfers acting as additional financial resources of four thousand forty dollars and twenty-two
cents ($ ), while the receipts to the departments
amount to fifteen thousand six hundred eighty do!lars and
seventeen cents ($ ). Balances from the year  
were brought forward to in the amount of three thousand
two hundred nineteen dollars and forty-six cents ($ ).
Balances have been carried forward to in the sum of
thirty-two thousand three hundred forty-two dollars and
thirty cents ($ ). Transfers from departments to
general receipts were nine hundred ninety-seven dollars and

t
REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
nine cents ($ ). The total expenditures were six hundred thirty-eight thousand six hundred sixty-seven dollars
and twenty-one cents ($ ), which shows an overdraft in the Highways Department of seven thousand five
hundred thirty-two dollars and twenty-two cents ($ ).

In the appropriation order of the Highways Department was given seventy-five thousand dollars ($ )
and the excise tax to be paid by the Holyoke Street Railway
Company. The excise tax for as levied by the Assessors was seven thousand eight hundred twelve dollars and
sixty-six cents ($ ). The company filed an appeal
late in the year with the Massachusetts Public Service Com- |
mission for revision of the excise tax rate and pending the
decision on the appeal has refused to pay the tax as levied.
The matter is in the hands of the City Solicitor, but up to
the present time no decision has been rendered, the case
having been continued to future date with the advice to
the city that conference be held with the company with
the idea of arriving at compromise rate. The failure of
the company to pay its excise tax has consequently thrown
the amount expended in anticipation of this tax in the Highways Department over to the appropriations for settlement to the amount of seven thousand five hundred thirty-two
dollars and twenty-two cents ($ ), in addition to the
bills amounting to six thousand two hundred ninety-seven
dollars and eleven cents ).

Bills have been carried forward to for payment
from the special appropriation made by the Board of Aldermen in December amounting to fifty-nine thousand nine hun- .
dred twenty-three dollars and thirty-one cents ($ )
in the departments as follows, viz: Alleys, eleven hundred
Seventy dollars and sixty-six cents ($ City Property, nine thousand five hundred twenty-one dollars and
Seven cents ($ Fuel, thirty-three thousand seven
hundred sixty-eight dollars and sixty-eight cents ($ ;
Lighting, five thousand two hundred fifty-nine dollars and

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS

eighty-three cents ($ ); Highways, (not including
excise tax overdraft), six thousand two hundred ninetyseven dollars and eleven cents ($ Street Watering,
three thousand nine hundred six dollars and two cents
($ making the total liabilities in the department
to be met from the taxation, including the excise tax,
sixty-seven thousand four hundred fifty-five dollars and
fiftv-three cents ($ ). Should the Holyoke Street
Railway Company pay the excise tax in  the amount
paid should be credited to this amount to be paid from the

| appropriation.

The erection of bath house on the property of the
East Dwight Street School was started during the year and
will be finished early the coming winter, the total contracts
and extras for this building being twenty-three theusand seven
hundred thirty dollars ($ ). With the work necessary
for the city to do in connection with this building the structure will not be completed within the total appropriation
of twenty-five thousand dollars ($ ). This will provide
@ modern, well equipped swimming pool and baths for this
section of the city which will meet long requirement and
will not interfere with any future use for which the East
Dwight Street School building may be desired.

Much work has been done upon the public buildings
and it is believed that the buildings are in very good condition at the present time. As the buildings grow older there
is more and more work to be done upon them each year and
as the buildings increase in number the expenditures in this
department must necessarily increase. The total cost of
maintenance of school buildings as paid from all depart, ments in was forty-nine thousand twenty-eight dollars
and thirty cents ($ ); fire department buildings,
nine thousand three hundred sixty-seven dollars and seven
eents ($ all other buildings, including new construction, Ward One Bath House, sixty-two thousand nine
hundred  ninety-three dollars and twenty-nine cents

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
($ and all other expenses going into public buildings in the City Property Department, seven thousand two
hundred twenty-four dollars and ninety-six cents ($ ),
making the total amount expended for maintennace and new
construction one hundred twenty-eight thousand six hundred
thirteen dollars and sixty-two cents ($ ).

’ The School Department has asked for material alterations in the West Holyoke School, the extent of which the .
Board is not now conversant with. The building has been
in use many years and it is possible it had outgrown the
needs of that section.

The residents of-Smiths Ferry are also asking for a
new school building, but the initiative action in this matter
lies in the hands of the School Committee.

The Board believes that separate appropriations outside
of the City Property Department should be made for the
maintenance of the salary account in the sanitaries in the
City Hall building and for the caretakers of the City Hall
Annex. It also recommends the establishment of direct appropriations for pensions and for vacations and also separate appropriation for the maintenance of the City Yard,
under which teams owned by the city should be classified.

The Board would strongly recommend that an attempt
be made the current year to provide all of the public buildings during the spring and early summer months with sufficient coal to run them during the winter of  .

Petitions have been received for the extension of the
street lighting system in Smiths Ferry, Homestead avenue,
West Holyoke, and the Fidelity tract, so-called. If these
sections are to be accommodated there will be considerable
added expense in the Lighting Department during the year.
The underground street lighting system was extended on
High Street from Cabot Street to Norfolk Street, which
must also be cared for in the appropriation for  .

Permanent pavements have been laid or existing pavements reconstructed to new form of pavement on many

The Department. was obliged to purchase two new conerete machines, one large Ransome paver and one smaller
Republic mixer, at cost of three thousand three hundred
seventy-five dollars ($ ).

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS

The total expenditures in this department were two
hundred ten thousand six hundred twenty-four dollars and
forty-seven cents ($ ).

The purchase of plant for laying sheet asphalt might
well be given attention.

The erection and maintenance of street signs and also
direction signs in the outlying districts is subject for
consideration.

It is the firm belief of the Board that the main highways or streets leading into the heart of the city from all

: directions should be placed in thoroughly satisfactory condition at as early date as may be possible. From survey made it does not appear that there is thoroughly satisfactory entrance, so far as pavements are concerned, to the
center of the city from any direction. Coming into Holyoke
from the north there is short stretch of pavement between
Kenilworth and the Mt. Tom Golf Club that should be permanently improved. From this point to Dwight Street the
pavement is practically new. On Dwight Street from Northampton Street to approximately Ivy Avenue there is good
pavement. The present roadway between Ivy Avenue and
Forestdale Avenue should be replaced with permanent,
smooth pavement. This being done, the roadways from the

’ north and west of the river will have been cared for. The
installation of new pavement on Dwight Street in the above
location will also care for the entrance to the city from
Easthampton, and it is much to be hoped that during the
coming year the Massachusetts Public Works Board will
complete the Easthampton Road, so-called, authorized under
Chapter of the General Acts of  It is understood
that some preliminary surveys of this work have been mude

| but the Board has no definite knowledge of the extent to
which the work has been carried. Under the Act the authorized expenditure is fifty thousand dollars ($ of which
the City is to pay one-half, the State one-quarter, and the
County one-quarter. After construction the road is to be

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS .
maintained by the City. This road will, when completed,
‘prove of great: benefit to the City as well as to the surrounding towns. .

From the north and the east of the river, or from the
South Hadley Falls bridge, the pavement is in good condition on Bridge and Canal Streets as far as its intersection
with Main and Race streets. The pavement on Race Street
between Canal Street and Dwight Street should be reconstructed by recutting the blocks and relaying them on conerete foundation. The pavement on Main Sstreet. between
Dwight and Canal Streets should be reconstructed with some
form of smooth pavement. Improvements should be made
on the Dwight Street hill from High Street to Front Street
to make this smoother riding roadway for automobiles and,
if thought advisable, Appleton Street between High Street
and Main Street should be relaid with reeut granite blocks.
The pavement on Race Street between Dwight Street and
Appleton Street is now thoroughly satisfactory.

If the Appleton Street pavement was reconstructed it
would care for traffic coming into the city from Chicopee,
or, if it  desired to carry this traffie direct to Igh Street
through Cabot Street, some work of reconstructing the pavement on Cabot Street from Alain Street westerly should be
considered. It is believed that Park Street and Crescent
Street between Appleton Street and Canal Street should be
improved so as to take considerable amount of traffie from
Main Street, and in improving this street the traffie coming
from Chicopee, Willimansett and the south would be cared
for also.

Temporary repairs have been made from time to time
on Ingleside Street or the upper Springfield Road, so-ealled,
at considerable expense, and the Board beleves that it

 would be matter of economy to construct permanent form
of roadway on this street, also extending the permanent
form of construction from the top of the Whiting Hill,
so-called, on Northampton Street, to the Ingleside Underpass,

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
and thence continuing through Ingleside Street to the Springfield Road. This street is used largely by Holyoke people
going south and coming north, as well as by much through
traffic, and rough stretch of roadway is not favorable
advertisement for any city. Benefits to be derived from continuous roadways of agreeable and satisfactory construction
cannot be emphasized too strongly for the good of the entire
city. It is believed that careful study of this phase of road
building should be made and movement started this year
to earry it into effect.

: Attention should be given to the Westfield Road from
Northampton Street to the Westfield line, placing upon this
road good smooth wearing surface. The road is used to
a considerable extent for traffic between Holyoke and Westfield at the present time and would be used much more if
placed in satisfactory condition.

The Board is of the opinion that the roadway on Bridge
Street in Ward One should be of permanent construction and

also that Lyman Street from Center Street to Bridge Street
should be paved and the paving repaired between Canal
Street and Center Street. Some attention must be given to
the wood block paving on Main street south of Dwight
Street as this paving is beginning to show defects. Bowers
Street from East Dwight Street to Ely Street should be paved
with non-slippery roadway, preferably recut granite blocks.
The pavement on Mosher Street from Main Street under the
Boston Maine Railroad bridge to Bowers Street must be
relaid in order to give satisfactory entrance to the Boston Maine Railroad station.

The time has come when the Board believes that an
enlargement to the City Yard property is imperative. It
does not seem to it to be good business policy to allow implements and apparatus of the Department to remain out
of doors or the property of the Department to be stored
in the vacant lot without protection from the outside. It
believes, if possible, that lot owned by the Holyoke Water

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
Power Company on the east side of Commercial Street between the present City Yard property and Sargeant Street
should be acquired by the city; that additional buildings
should be constructed for the storage of apparatus and that
the whole should be properly enclosed for the protection of
the city property. For the present part of this could be
satisfactorily accomplished by the construction of an iron
fence.

It is the opinion of the Board that motorized equipment
should be installed in the Outdoor Department and that if
funds are not available for the purchase of all equipment
desired it is hoped that money can be found for the purchase
of five-ton combination truck equipped with apparatus for
oiling streets and also with dumping body for use in other
work at times when this truck would not be in use for dust
laying purposes.

It is believed that it would be matter of economy to
purchase one or more motor trucks for the hauling of ashes
from some central collecting points in the various sections
of the city to the dumping grounds. It is fully realized that |
it would be impossible to use motor apparatus in many sections of the city, especially in the alleys in the business
sections, but it  believed that the trucks would be of matenial saving in long hauls. It will be but short time comparatively when Holyoke will face the serious question of
providing dumping grounds for the ashes accumulation. The
only available place where any material dumping can be
done at the present time is in Elmwood Park over the cul! verts being constructed. It might prove of material benefit
to the Department if studies of the outlying sections could
be given in order to provide for the future needs of this
department, and it is fact that in many ways the department is carrying on its work in the same way and under
about the same conditions that it has for years and in the
opinion of the Board the time is ripe for material changes 
in the methods of doing the work. The installation of
modern machinery should be considered.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS

The cost of removing ashes was approximately fortyseven thousand, one hundred eighteen dollars, ($ )
while the cost of papers removal was four thousand, three
hundred fifty-one dollars ($ and teams maintenance
in this department cost five thousand, eight hundred seventysix dollars and ninety-five cents ($ and should be
included as part of the ashes and papers removal. The
Board has continued the salvaging from the City dumps the
past year, one contractor being given the privilege of salvaging from all the dumps. For this the City has received a
revenue of approximately four hundred dollars ($ a
year.

Contracts for the collection of garbage expire May  ,
 Garbage contracts were let in for pericd of
one year only at total cost of ten thousand six hundred
two dollars ($ ). The Board would strongly recommend that the garbage contracts be let for period of three

years in that it believes that more satisfactory contracts
can be made and the work better performed. This will be
a matter for your future consideration. Contracts in the
| past have usually been made for two year periods. The
objection to the one year period is that the contractors are :
unable to make as satisfactory arrangements for their
equipment on one year basis as they would be for longer
term. Also, that more satisfactory arrangements could be
made for the disposal of the animals raised on the garbage,
| which is used principally for feeding purposes.

A start was made the current year in the work of replacing the canal bridges by the construction of steel
girder, encased in concrete, structure over the first level
canal on Appleton Street. The contract price of this work
was twenty-eight thousand, four hundred dollars ($ )
with two hundred dollars ($ extras, making the total
eontract price for the bridge twenty-eight thousand, six
hundred dollars (# ). The approaches were re-arranged to the full width of sixty feet of street as originally

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  

laid out. Recut granite blocks were laid between the
New York, New Haven Hartford Railroad tracks and
the bridge on concrete foundation grouted with cement
concrete in place of the old blocks on sand base formerly on
the street. While this work was not entirely completed at
the close of the fiseal year, the work was done so that the
bridge was opened for traffic on December The
roadway is forty feet in width with sidewalks on
either side nine feet in width. The bridge is of modern
design, well calculated to fulfill the services required and
the Board can see no reason why it should not eare for the
traffie on this street for many years to come.

The Board is firmly of the opinion that careful and
painstaking study should be given to the bridge situation and
hopes that an appropriation will be made in for the
construction of at least one new canal bridge. It is also
urged that conscientious examination be made of the South
Hadley Falls and Willimansett Bridges and also all of the
canal bridges and that sufficient amounts be appropriated
to make such repairs as appear to be necessary, and for the
painting of the ironwork. The Board has persistently ad' vised that appropriations be made for the upkeep of these
bridges. It is not with the intention of causing unnecessary
alarm that these recommendations are made but as has been
Stated in the past, the life of these structures is limited and
many of them have passed what might be termed the safe
life of the ironwork without repairs being made. The application of cement for protective purposes has progressed
to degree where it might be well to consider this as protective coating on all ironwork below the roadways.

In the Permanent Sewer Department the Franklin
Street culvert was extended to connect with the Bh
Street culvert and the large culvert was extended down the
Elmwood Park ravine for distance of two hundred sixtyeight feet at cost of eight thousand, three hundred
sixteen dollars ($ ), the length of the Franklin Street
connection being fifty-eight feet.

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
Sewers were laid in portions of Brookline Avenue,
: Florence Avenue westerly from Northampton Street, in
Larkin Avenue north from Glen Street, in Lawler and
Martin Streets, in Northampton Street from Florence Avenue northerly, in Portland Street from Bh Street westerly, surface water sewer constructed from the upper
Springfield Road from point north of St. Vincent Street
to the Springfield Road and along the Springfield Road to
connect with the present sewer; in Summer Street south
from Jackson Street, and in Winchester Avenue from Portland Street to the property of the City Hospital Association. The storm water sewer from the upper Springfield
Road to the lower road will care for the drainage on the land
westerly and prevent flooding of adjacent property from
water being discharged upon the street from the Holyoke
& Westfield Railroad. The sewer for caring for the storm
water down the South Street hill near the Holyoke Westfield Railroad tracks was constructed from South Street in
the park land east of High Street to South Street.

The housing problem in Holyoke has reached an acute
stage and one that demands immediate attention. New
tracts are being continually opened for building purposes
and with the opening of these tracts additional sewer accommodations are needed. The Fidelity Land Company,
so-called, has opened tract on the former Street property
west of Northampton Street upon which  considerable
number of new houses are now being erected. During the
year the Board recommended the construction of sewers to
eare for the property of the Fidelity Land Company. The
Engineer made careful study in the premises and recommended sewers in this section, the estimated cost of which
was thirty-nine thousand, one hundred  sixty dollars
($ ), located in streets as follows, the estimate giving
the size of pipe recommended, the length of sewers in the
streets and the estimated cost of the work, viz:

The Board has also recommended that in the Tobey
Land Company’s Elmhurst tract sewers be constructed at
an estimated cost of fourteen thousand, nine hundred
sixty-two dollars and fifty cents ($ ). The Engineer's estimate in the matter being as follows:
Bay State Road ......... ”" pipe, feet,  per foot,

In order to construct these sewers and turn their flow
into the Franklin Street culvert it will be advisable to extend
the culvert in Elmwood Park running parallel with Franklin Street and Jackson Street from the end of the present
culvert west of Maple Street to meet the new culvert con  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS

structed the current vear. The Engineer's estimate of this
work is eight thousand, three hundred dollars ).
The Koard beheves that this unfinished part of the culvert
should be constructed the current summer and recommended its construction the past year owing to breakage
of the Franklin Street sewer in Elmwocd Park. The Franklin Street sewer is now discharging into the ravine in the
park and some complaint has been made concerning this.
If this stretch of culvert is not constructed it will be necessary to repair the Franklin Street sewer and owing to the
nature of the soil and the washes in the dingle the Board
believes that the repair work will prove expensive. There is
now danger of land slides which may eause further breaks
in this sewer and cause the same to prove constant expense for maintenance. The Engineer estimates that one
thousand dollars ($ will be required to repair this
sewer and the Board believes that it will be the part of
economy to construct the remaining part of the culvert, even
at the increased expense, and divert the entire flow of the
sewers into the culvert.

The purchase of suitable apparatus for cleaning our
eatch basins needs attention. Worcester has installed the
past year motor apparatus for this work, made by Fitchburg company, the operation of which in this city, it is
believed, will reduce the cost of the work more than one-half.

Sidewalks were reconstructed on Appleton Street and
Elm Street at the Methodist Church property and new
sidewalks were bult or curbing laid on parts of Fairfield
Avenue, abutting Hamilton Park, on the west side of Iigh
Street northerly from Jackson Street, on Lexington Avenue,
on the south side of Longwood Avenue from Northampton
Street to Martin Street, on the north side of Myrtle Avenue
from Northampton Street to Harrison Avenue. Curbing
was laid on the west side of St. Jerome Avenue from Sargeant Street to St. James Avenue and walk was laid in
this location between Dwight Street and Sargeant Street.

|

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  

Also, curbing was laid on the east side of St. Jerome Avenue

from Sargeant Street to Dwight Street with the exception

of the property of the Forestdale Cemetery Association. A

walk was laid on the north side of Suffolk Street between

Clinton Avenue and School Street while walks were laid on

both sides of Waldo Street between Beacon Avenue and

Hampden Street.

A considerable amount of other sidewalk work was also
accomplished. It is hoped that the appropriations for the
coming year in both the Sidewalks Permanent Construction
and Sidewalks Maintenance departments will be sufficient to
provide the pressing needs. The expenditures in the Permanent Sidewalks department were ten thousand, fifty-five
dollars and seventy cents ($ ), and in the maintenance department twelve thousand, eight hundred sixtyseven dollars and fourteen cents ($ ).

The expenditures in the various departments under the
control of the Board from January to November

aot REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER
BRIDGES

This year beginning was made to carry out the policy
of rebuilding the canal bridges to meet the ever increasing
demands of modern travel.

The First Level Canal Bridge on Appleton Street was
selected as the one most in need of replacement. Early in
the year the Board of Public Works requested the City Engineer to furnish general specifications which would give
opportunity for variety in design and these were aceurdingly
prepared and accepted. The call for bids brought several
designs which were submitted to an expert bridge engineer,
Professor Lewis E. Moore, of Boston. The bid of the Eastern
Bridge Company, of Worcester, Mass., was selected as the
best proposition for the City and the contract was awarded
to them May The bridge was completed December
  All steel girders and beams are encased in concrete, applied by the gunnite process which gives very
de se mixture, practically impervious to water. Protected
in this manner the structure will undoubtedly give service
for at least hundred years.

For many years the City Engineer in his annual report
has tried to impress on the City Government the crying need
of giving proper attention to the maintenance of our many

bridges. Full realization of their condition was not apparent
until the new structure over the first level canal on Appleton
Street made it necessary to remove the old bridge which had
been in place for nearly half century. It was proposed to
use this bridge to replace the present wooden bridge on
Jackson Street over the second level canal. This proved to
be impractical as many of the members of the Appleton
Street bridge were so corroded that they fell apart on being
lifted out by the derrick. Temporary repairs were made on
the Jackson Street bridge to obviate the necessity of closing
it to travel as closing of this bridge would inconvenience a
number of our most important manufacturers. Permission

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER  
was obtained from the Holyoke Water Power Company to
place temporary supports in the canal to make this bridge
sare until arrangements could be made for replacing it with
a new structure adapted to future needs of that location.
A report on the Lyman Street bridges over the first and
second level canals is on file in the office of the Board of
Publie Works.

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER
SEWERS

An extension feet in length was made to the culvert
in Elmwood dingle and the Oakdale storm water sewer was
connected up. During the early summer the continued spell
of wet weather softened the earth causing serious slide of
the steep banks which carried away part of the  -inch
domestic sewer on the northerly side of the dingle in the
vicinity of Pine Street. Later on in the season after repairs
had been completed in this section another slide took place
about feet easterly from the first break. It was con-.

. sidered best to postpone repairs in this latest break until
next year when it is proposed to complete the main culvert.

Surveys, maps and estimates were made for drainage of
the tracts of land, known as Elmhurst and Maple Terrace,
west of Northampton Street. The first tract includes the
valley north of Cherry Street running parallel with Northampton Street and having its natural drainage outlet at the
intersection of Cherry and Northampton Streets. It is not
intended to care for Crystal Brook which flows through this
territory and discharges into the dingle at Ball’s corner. The
system is designed to care for domestic drainage only.

The Maple Terrace tract owned by the Fidelity Land
Company will connect with the main storm water drain in
Franklin Street, Oakdale, which at present is constructed

, from Elmwood dingle as far as Sycamore Street.

Several washouts have occurred at various times in the

vicinity of the Ice House on Prospect Street. Your Engineer

was asked to devise means of remedying conditions to prevent
a recurrence of the washouts. special catch basin was
designed by the City Engineer and built under his direction.
Although we have had many severe rain storms since the installation, no further washouts have taken place. Similar
catch basins were designed for Front Street at Prospect
Street and for South Street west of the Holyoke and Westfield Railroad.

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER 
Early in November break occurred in water pipe on
Main Street at Berkshire Street causing considerable inconvenience by flooding the street. The Water Department
superintendent made an extended investigation to locate the
source of the trouble but was obliged to abandon the matter
and turn it over to the Board of Public Works. The City
Engineer made certain recommendations which were carried
out by the Board and the trouble has been eliminated.

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER  
PAVEMENTS

During the year dangerous condition was eliminated
by making long easy curve around the corner at the intersection of Suffolk and Appleton Streets. Appleton Street
from Suffolk Street to Pleasant Street was also widened two
( feet. Reverend John C. Ivers made arrangements by
which the land necessary for the widening was donated to
the City.

SPRINGFIELD ROAD

There has been much criticism of the asphalt paving
laid in the Springfield Road in by Daniel O’Connell’s
Sons according to their own specifications. It was supposed
that frost heaved and broke the concrete base. When the
asphalt top was stripped off, however, the concrete was
found to be in as good condition as when first constructed.
The original asphalt surface was laid without binder
course, method which has since been universally abandoned.
After stripping ton coating of cement, concrete averaging
  inches in thickness was laid on the old conerete base and
an additional width of three feet was placed on the westerly
side of the roadway. The top concrete was kept inches
away from the west rail of the street railway tracks to allow
for renewal of rails without breaking the concrete pavement.
This space was then filled with an asphaltic mixture sloping
from the concrete to the rail. The street so treated is ap. proximately half mile in length.

Conerete paving was also laid in Northampton Street
from Morgan Street to the Mt. Tom Golf Club; in Pearl
Street from Hampden Street to Highland Avenue; in
Nonotuck Street from Dwight to Fairfield Avenue; in Fairfield Avenue on the southerly drive from Nonotuck Street to.
the westerly end of the park; in Dartmouth Street from
Pleasant Street to Wellesley Road; in Brown Avenue from
Laurel Street to the dingle and on the northerly side of
Sargeant Street from Bh Street to Northampton Street.

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER

The granite block paving on Canal Street from Mosher
Street to the County bridge and on the east side of Main
Street from Appleton Street to Dwight Street was taken
up, recut and relaid on concrete base. Daniel O’Connell’s
Sons were awarded the contract for this work. Race Street
from Dwight Street to Appleton Street was paved with
vitrified block by Daniel O’Connell’s Sons.

This year table of the approximate quantities of
cement, sand and stone required for various thicknesses and
widths of concrete pavements was prepared by the City Engineer. It has been found very convenient for estimating
purposes and is as follows: ,

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER  
HEARINGS

A hearing was held at the State House, Boston, before
the Legislative Committee on Ways and Means, to obtain
state aid for the improvement of the Easthampton Road from
Northampton Street to the Easthampton line. The City Engineer amongst others attended the hearing in the interests
of the City. State Highway engineers have completed surveys of the road but their plans and recommendations are
not yet available.

The City Engineer was the principal witness in the
Springfield Bridge apportionment hearing before the Supreme Court in Boston.

A hearing given by the Public Service Commission on
the street railway excise tax was attended by the Engineer.
These hearings entail much special study and preparation.

PARKS

In Springdale Park the wooden shelter which had been
destroyed by fire was replaced by new building of larger
dimensions. The plans and specifications prepared in this
office provided for boys’ and girls’ dressing rooms and a
matron’s quarters. The building is of stucco exterior with
concrete floors. The asphaltic shingle roof projects over the
piazzas and is supported in front by row of stucco columns.

FIRE DEPARTMENT

Plans were prepared for strengthening the floor of the
Mt. Tom Engine House on Canal Street to accommodate one
of the heavier pieces of fire apparatus. As other arrangements, however, have been made for the disposition of the
apparatus which was to have been placed in this house these
improvements have been deferred.

  REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER
MAPS

Maps for the City Solicitor to be used in accident cases
were prepared in this office.

The City Engineer prepared maps and testified as one
of the witnesses for the city in all cases which came to trial
before the Superior Court. It is suggested that it would be
less expensive for the City to keep sidewalks in repair than
to defend accident suits, which in the majority of cases are
decided against the municipality.

Assessors’ maps were prepared in this office.

Sewer assessment maps containing names of all abutters,
areas, frontages and assessments for all sewers built during
the year were made by this department.

Lines and grades for all sewers, roadways and sidewalks
built this year were also given.

Plans were prepared for garage to hold two cars to be
erected at the City Farm. The building is now almost completed.
