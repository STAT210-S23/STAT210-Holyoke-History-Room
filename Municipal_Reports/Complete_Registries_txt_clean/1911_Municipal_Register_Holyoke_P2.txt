} The annual inspection of hotels and boarding houses |
! was made during the month of May, as required ‘by law,
: and all sleeping rooms were found to be equipped with the
| necessary means of escape in case of fire.
No department of the city is so misunderstood as that
of the Inspection of Buildings. Many people apparently believe that the Inspector of Buildings should personally direct all the operations and thereby relieve the owner of all
responsibility.
| After plans have been approved by the Inspector. it is
: to the interest of property owners to see that their build| ings are construeted by experienced mechanics under the di! rection of competent foreman.
: INDEXING ORDINANCES.

- The building ordinances have been indexed and will
greatly aid architects, builders and others who have occasion
to refer to the various sections.

REPORT OF THE
B e
oard of Park Commissioners
To His Honor, the Mayor, and Gentlemen of the Board |
of Aldermen:

We have the honor to submit to you the annual report .
of the Board of Park Commissioners together with detailed report of the expenditures and recommendations for
the oming Vear.

The season Just passed has been very uneventful owing
to the lack of finances, Which were hardly enough to pay for
the care of the parks. For this same reason the parks were
elosed one week earher than has been the eustom.

We beg to submit herewith brief resume of the year's
work and the condition of the different parks.

ELMWOOD PARK.

Boxes were put around twenty-four trees in this park,
and the leaves cleaned out from between the trees to lessen
the risk from fires. The ‘bad storm of last July uprooted
yne hundred and thirteen trees in the park. Some few were
in condition that they could be replaced and propped up.
Much havoe was wrought by this storm, which entailed a
great deal of work to bring things back to their former condition. The work of improvement at Elmwood Park is held
at standstill by the lack of the completion of the culvert,
Which should ‘be extended up to Pine street. The long
talked of and wished for bridge, which would prove such a
convenience to so many citizens, cannot be attempted until
this is done.

po thy
REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS |
LAUREL STREET TRIANGLE. a
! |
This new portion of land was seeded down in the spring !
and made attractive with shrubs. !
HAMPDEN PARK.
I
Here the walks were recovered and drains put in by the
Board of Publie Works. This, of course, was quite contrary |
to custom, but as the Park Board finances did not permit .
the improvement, they allowed and approved this action. so
that citizens might benefit by the much needed change.
|
PROSPECT PARK.
The ‘bad storm of July, that everywhere did so much
damage, made serious trouble here. It damaged the parapet wall and caused one of the outlooks to give away. This
necessitated repairs which we trust are permanent. Nothing
new was attempted here, ‘but it was kept up in the usual
good condition.
CANONCHET PARK.
Here too nothing new was done. It was kept in the best
condition possible.
HAMILTON PARK.
This park was spaded up and seeded down as usual, but
nothing new was done.
GERMANIA PARK.
There is nothing new to report concerning Germamia
Park: it was cared for as usual, and was enjoyed by the
people in that neighborhood.

, REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS
RIVERSIDE PARK.

The sewer pipe, which also conveyed the overflow from
the spring water, was lowered into the river so that it would
be impossible for people to reach it and drink of the contaminated water.

| The wading pool has proved as popular as ever and was
erowded with children, especially during the intense heat
of last summer.
JONES’ POINT.

This spot has received but little attention, aside from
the mowing of the underbrush and the raking up of the
leaves. Plans have been made for the development of this
possession, but funds have not ‘been fortheoming. When
money is appropriated for the development of this large
tract of land, it promises to be the most beautiful of the
City’s Possessions.

ALL OTHER PARKS.

The strip of land in the center of Fairfield avenue was
taken on and cared for this vear without any increase in the
force of park employees or in expense to the eity. The
shrubbery was kept trimmed, the ground fertilized and the
vras'ss mowed.

GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS.
| We have ereatly improved the svstem of sanitary drinking fountains in all the parks, thus aiding the fight for pubhe health.

In conelusion we woukl most respectfully offer the following suggestions

First: That provision be male for the completion of

— the eulvert in Elmwood Park up to Pine street. and the
erection of the bridge crossing the ravine at this point.

REPORT OF PARK COMMISSIONERS  

Second: That the contemplated improvements in Prospect Park be carried out aecording to plans prepared.

Third: That recreation building be established in the
near future at Riverside Park, as such structure is greatly
wished for by the people who use the park.

We continue to advise the purchase of lands for park
purposes, while such Jand may be had at reasonable prices.

In order to continue the maintenance of our parks in
a proper manner, and to provide for the further development, we ask for the following appropriations: :

For the eare and maintenance of all parks......  
For development work on Elmwood Park and

extenston of culvert .......      
For development work on Prospect Park.......  
For development work on Riverside Park...... 
For development work on Jones Park .........  
For development work, all other parks.........  

We ask that due consideration be given to our requests
and that this coming year sufficient money be put at the
disposal of the Park Board so that the parks may be cared
for and developed as they should be in city of this size.
Lack of finances has seriously crippled the work in the past
year,

We append herewith detailed statement of our recelpts and expenditures, an itemized account of our disbursements, our labor aecount ‘by months, and the cost of
development and repairs.

REPORT OF THE
Board of Public Works
To the Honorable, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen of
the City of Holyoke:—

Gentlemen :—First let it be said that the year will
stand, record, for the achievement and successful completion of many permanent undertakings desired for many
years by the City of Holyoke.

Brietly, two hundred twenty thousand six hundred nine

: dollars ($ have been expended for new buildings
and the repair and maintenance of existing buildings.  
| majority of which amount went for school structures. In
addition sixty-four thousand six hundred nine dollars
( were placed in permanent road work; fourteen
thousand one hundred seventy dollars ($ for per
manent sidewalk construction; thirty thousand seven hun
dred ‘three dollars ($ for the care and removal of
ashes and garbage; fifty-one thousand one hundred  mnety
dollars ($ for the maintenance and reeonst ruction
of highways and streets; twenty-eight thousand six undred
nine-one doflars ($ for the lighting of our streets,
parks and buildings; eleven thousand seventy-one dollars
($ for ‘the maintenance and care of playgrounds aud
an almost equal amount, eleven thousand eight hundred
sixty-four dollars ($ ). for the construetion of perma:
nent sewers; for the care and maintaining of existing sewer
nine thousand one hundred fifty-nine dollars ($ ): for
the promotion of health and comfort in abating and lessening the dust nuisance twelve thousand nine hundred forty
five dollars ). In the amount of two hundred
twenty thousand six hundred nine dollars above

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
mentioned for the erection and maintenance of buildings,
one hundred sixty-eight thousand seventy-nine dollars
($ went to our school houses, the following new
work being included, viz:—East Dwight Street School renovation, fifteen thousand four hundred ninety-six dollars
($ for the complestion of the Ingleside School, the
erection of wall and grading, fourteen thousand four
hundred twenty-four dollars ($ ); Joseph Metealf
School, forty-one thousand two hundred sixty-five dollars
($ ); for the completing of the William Whiting
School. thirty-four thousand four hundred sixty dollars
( ), and for the general reconstruction of existing
buildings to meet the demands of the State Inspectors, six
thousand fifteen dollars ). The City Farm additions
thus far have cost seven thousand one hundred thirty-eight
dollars ($ ). the Tuberculosis Hospital, the grading of
the grounds and the pumping station, seventeen thousand
one hundred forty-two dollars ($ ), and for plans in
part for the Isolation Hospital buildings, five hundred five
dollars ($ ). These amounts represent actual cash expenditures for  :

The contracts already entered into bring the cost of the
Joseph Metealf School to sixty-three thousand six hundred
ninety-three dollars ($ ). This building, it is hoped,
will be completed dumng the early menths of the coming
spring.

The Ingleside and Whiting School buildings were completed with the exception of some seeding and sidewalk
econstruetion at the Ingleside School. The Whiting School
Without. furnishings represents an expenditure of fifty-nine
thousand six hundred thirty-two dollars ($ ), the Ingleside Sehool of thirty thousand five hundred) twenty-one
dollars ($ without site for which two thousand dollars ($ were paid.

— The two pieces of work uppermost in the minds of the
people this vear. we believe. were the oenstruction of the

  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS

Tuberculosis Hospital started last December and the building of the parapet wall along the easterly side of Railroad
street and the Improvements in the roadway on that street.

The construction of the roadway on Railroad street has
been accomplished at less than the estimated expense per
yard. The work performed is permanent and with the coming of spring will be completed, the only remaining work

| to be done being the construction of concrete sidewalks, the
installation of lighting system and the laying of few
yards of granite blocks. The granite block pavement was
laid at cost of two dollars and eighty-five cents ($ )
per vard or nine thousand sixty-five dollars ($ entire.
The wall will cost fifteen thousand seven hundred thirty-one
dollars ($ while one thousand eight hundred ninetyfive dollars ($ were expended for curbing, making the
total cost of the street without sewers or electric ducts,
twenty-six thousand six hundred ninety-two dollars
($ ).

The Tuberculosis Hospital is ready for opening except
some small furnishings. The main contract was performed
by V. V. Godidlard at an expense of eight thousand eight
hundred seven dollars ($ ), the plumbing ‘by D. J. Bowler at one thousand thirty-five dollars ($ and heating system was installed by P. J. Moriarty at one thousand
twenty dollars ($ ), making total of ten thousand
eight hundred six'ty-three dollars ($ ). There was
some extra construction amounting to four hundred twentytwo dullars ($ ); the excavating for foundations amounted to one thousand two hundred forty-two dollars ($ )
while for plans and inspection five hundred eighteen dollars
($ were expended. The lghting fixtures cost ninetyeight dollars ($ ). The sewer connections and the water
supply were expensive owing to the location of the building.
The first cost one thousand ninety-eight dollars ($ ),
while for the latter it Was nevessary to construct at the foot
of the incline pumping station consisting of an electric

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  
motor, air compressors, triplex pump, storage tanks and
automatic devices for maintaining steady pressure at the
building of some fifty pounds. The building is connected with the pumping station by four-inch pipe line.
This pipe line with the pumping apparatus in the house
represents an expenditure of three thousand six hundred
thirty dollars ($ ). The furnishings will cost approximately two thousand dollars ($ ). Future use of the
land connected with the building by the Isolation Hospital,
as now planned, will permit of the sewer and water services
heing used jointly by all buildings, which should lessen the
cost of the two pro rata by the combined uses made of the
systems. .

The additions to the City Farm building as planned will
cost about ten thousand four hundred fifty-eight dollars
($ and will be completed during the spring of  .

During the years past Holyoke has been compelled to
erect, enlarge or remodel school buildings nearly every year.
It is now thought that with the completion of the Joseph
Metcalf School sufficient accommodation has been made for
at least few years so that sums equal to the money we
have been borrowing for this purpose can either be diverted
into other channels, such as permanent sidewalk or street
improvements, or for the construction of ‘buildings for uses
other than for schools. It is believed that all of the existing
buildings are today in such state of repair that only ordinary minor work will have to: be done during the ocming
year. It must also be borne in mind that the maintenance
and eare of our public buildings are increasing as the number of buildings increase, which has been rather rapidly during the last few years, caused by the healthy growth of the
city. It is also to be thought of that not only does the repair account increase ‘but the cost for fuel, lighing and janlor service also grows larger as the number of buildings increase,

For the cost of heating our buildings we would refer



  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS

you to the itemized accounts in the Fuel Department, all
tabulated according to the expenditures in each building
and amounting in round numbers to twenty-four thousand
dollars ($ ).

The lighting of the buildings cost roughly three thousand three hundred dollars ($ ).

We would eall your attention to the expenditures in the
School Janitors’ Salaries Account as we believe that at no
far distant date it will be necessary for Holyoke to revise
her schedule of salaries as paid to janitors, that in the total
the revision will cause larger expenditure owing to the
so-called eight-hour law of  owing also to the fact that
the demands for janitor service and work in our school
buildings are becoming more exacting and that it is now
impossible for our janitors to perform in sehool hours work
which in the past was done within those hours and for the
reasons above an additional working force must be provided, the detailed arrangement for which can only be made
after eareful study of conditions.

In the Outdoor Department aside from Railroad street,
Essex street was paved with vitrified brick ‘between High
and Newton streets at cost of two dollars and tweny-one
cents ($ yard. Granite blocks were laid on Jackson
street between the main line of the Holyoke and Westfield
Railroad and the easterly line of ‘the first level canal at  
cost of two dollars and forty-seven cents ($ per yard
Roadways of bitulithie nature were constructed on Dwight
street from Forestdale avenue to Ivy avenue, four thousand
nine hundred seventy-eight yards, costing four thousand seventy-elght dollars ($ or eighty-one and minetenths cents per vard; Maple street from Fountal
street to Prospect street seven hundred twenty yards
at cost of five hundred fifty-three dollars ($ or seventy-six and eight-tenths cents per yard; Sehool street

twenty-two dollars and ten cents ), for which the
state has made payment. In order that Holyvoke’s part of
this road might not appear neglected, Northampton street
from Kenilworth to the Springfield road was resurfaced for
practically the entire distance at cost of two thousand
seven hundred ninety-three dollars ($ ), and the Spring  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS

field road between the West Springfield line and South
street was reconstructed at'a cost of two thousand one hundred thirty-seven dollars ($ ).

An appropriation of fifteen thousand dollars ($ )
was made for the construction of bridges the past vear, it

. being planned that the city would pay five thousand dollars

‘ ($ towards the cost of new bridge over Main street

at South street, the construction of which is now nearly
completed, the work being performed by the New York, New —

Haven and Hartford Railroad Company. It was also hoped

that some agreement could be made with the Holyoke Street

Railway Company whereby that company would assume a

part of the expense of the construction of new bridge crosslyg the seeond level canal on Cabot street and it was believed that this amount of money would be only fair proportion of the expense of building these bridges that the

eity should be asked to pay. Legally there may be question as to whether the Holyoke Street Railway Company

ean be required ‘to pay any part of the cost of the new bridge

on Cabot street. The Board is not willing to accede this

question but is of the opinion that the company will pay its

just proportion of the cost of this bridge during the coming

year. The bridge now on he street would do for tratfie for

sole time to Come were it not for the operation of the cars

over it.

The appliaction of dust-laving preparations and preventives, including water, but not including the purchase of
hew apparatus, cost the city twelve thousand three hundred
forty dollars ($ while two hundred seventy-six dollars ($ were paid for an oil distributor and five hundred dollars ($ for storage tank for oil. The dust
has been laid in Ilolvoke effectively and by all reeognized
high grade petrolenm oils or asphalt compositions in order
that for this particular climate and soil the Board micht
determine for itself the compounds and preparations which
it believes to be best adapted for Holyoke and by process

oT

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS ,
of elimination it has determined the materials or oils suited
to our needs so that in the coming year there should be
little or no uncertainty as to the results to be obtained. It
iS not too much to say that from all of the preparations used,
no better results have been obtained than from our own
water gas tar furnished to this Department without expense
through the kindness of the Gas and Electric Department.
The binding of the wearing surface of macadam roadways
with tar or bituminous preparations has also aided to great
extent in settling the dust. The larger street cleaning
force employed has also aided materially in the appearance
of the streets and in the prevention of dust.

As in the past, this Department is this vear indebted to
the Gas and Electric Department not only for the water gas
tar used in its street watering department but for ordinary
coal tar used for the construction of wearing surfaces on
the macadam roads. The only payment that the Department has been asked to make to the Gas and Electrie Department for tar of any kind has been that used by the sidewalk department for resurfacing and the construction of
new walks. The Board reeognizes the kindly cooperation
of the Manager of the Gas and Electric Department with
the Board not only in the dust-lavying problems and road
construction difficulties. but in the lighting of streets. bridges
and public buildings.

With Holyoke’s numerical growth its residential area
 expanding and the expansion of the residential area necessitates attention to its sanitary conditions, consequently the
residential expansion means increased expenditures for new
sewers, the cost of which the past vear was approximately
sixteen thousand five hundred dollars ($ ). .A sewer
in the Ingleside section has been built, relieving heretofore
unsanitary and unsatisfactory eondition, As the eity grows

in the Highland Park section. attention must be given this

| problem. Also new residential areas are being opened to

the west of Northampton street and the south of Cherry
|

nn —s— etn
  REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
street, to the east of Northampton street and the north of
Madison and Lexington avenues. Also ,expensive and
modern homes are being built to the west of Northampton ,
street north of Fairfield ‘avenue. Some of these sections
have been provided with sewer accommodations the past
year but it will be necessary to provide others with sewers
the coming year and still others in the more distant future.
The section south of Dwight street west of St. Jerome avenue and north of the cemetery, is being gradually opened |
and sewers are being extended im this section. The average
cost of sewers constructed in varies from forty-five
cents per foot to two dollars and twelve cents ($ )
per foot, with two exceptions, the storm water sewer on Essex street and the short exceptionally deep sewer on Monroe
street at its intersection with Dwight sreet, the latter being
construeed at the time the roadway of Dwight street was
permanently improved.

The construction of new catch basins has been continued |
through the vear, the policy steadily adhered to since the
organization of the Board. Another section of culvert approximately one hundred feet in length, was built on
Maple street furnishing permanent dumping grounds for ,
the ash department and which eventually will make pleasant |
park land from an unsightly ravine.

The growth of the city residentially also demands an
increase of permanent sidewalks, the lengthening out of ,
streets and curbing, which has been carried forward with
energy. it being impossible to perform all of the work
planned although the season was very favorable for work
to the elose of the fiseal year.

The playgrounds have been conducted in the past year
as in the former by the Playground Commission, the operating and construction expenditures being ten thousand |
seventy-five dollars ($ ), which includes part of the *
eost of construeting shelter on the Hampden Street Playground. This shelter was not completed November  ,

REPORT OF BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS  there being balanve due on the construction of this
building of one thousand four hundred fifteen dollars
($ ). which makes its total cost three thousand one hundred seventy-four dollars ($ ). For more detailed
statement of the activity in this departinent we would refer
vou to the financial statement hereto annexed and to the
report of the Commission.

The expenditures in the many departments under the
cantrol of the Board are set forth at ‘some length in the
tables following. The Department has been to considerable
pains to show the cost of the various items of work and of
Innumerable undertakings that we are unable to set forth
in any brief statement. We have seriously questioned many
times whether municipal report was worth its cost of preparation and distribution and we have seriously questioned
the extent to which we should go in the compilation of our
reports and we would like. if it were possible, that these
reports might be brought nearer to the people in general in
order that they may know and realize the work that  going
-on in the Department. The Board will be glad at anv time
to receive from any one suggestions as to the statisties to
be shown or the facts to be derived from this report. It is
desired to make it as plain as possible and as brief as is permissible. We therefore submit to vou for your consideration and for the knowledge of the public in general, the
itemized statements hereto annexed,

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT OF THE
To His Honor, the Mayor, and Gentlemen of the Board
of Aldermen:

Gentlemen :—In compliance with the public statutes, the
Board of Health herewith respectfully submit for your consideration the thirtyfirst annual report for the year ending
November .

 ORGANIZATION.

The members of the Board of Health met for organization the first Monday in February,  and elected the following officers: Arthur B. Wetherell, M. D., Chairman; J.
Sidney Wright, Secretary; J. Joseph Carroll, M. D., Bacteriologist.

In reviewing the work of the year, it  evident that the
work of the employees has been improved in scope and character and the Board placed on better working basis than
ever before. This is exactly what should oceur each sucding year, for the public health ought to be the first consideration in any community.

MORTALITY.

The death rate for the year, excluding non-residents,
was per cent per thousand, and ineluding non-residents,
  per cent. This is the lowest death rate, excepting one
year, since  It is very gratifying to note the decrease
for the year in the number of deaths from contagious and
infectious diseases.

|
  REPORT OF BUARD OF HEALTH
TUBERCULOSIS.

The death rate from tuberculosis during the past year
was per cent. Regarding tuberculosis, we have been
more active during the past year than ever before in our
attempt to prevent the spread of this disease and we are now
fumigating and disinfecting many homes where tubercular
cases are found. As this is not only preventable but a
curable disease, we hope that with the widespread interest
now manifested among our people in the causes and eonditions leading up to tuberculosis and its eare and treatment,
that our efferts will result in steady decrease in the
death rate from this disease in this city.

We desire to thank his honor, the Mavor, and all others
who in any way have assisted in the erection and furnishing
of the new hospital and we feel sure it will ‘be great benefit
to our city In the care and treatment of this disease.

TYPHOID FEVER.

There was an Increase in the number of cases reported
of this disease. Every case was carefully and thoroughly
investigated to ascertain if possible the probable souree of
infeetion. large number of cases were traced to sources
of infection outside of the city and these were without doubt )
imported and some of them were undoubtedly due to direct
contact with other cases. In many eases, however, it was
impossible to definitely trace the source of the typhoid infection as the patients had not been outside of the city for
many weeks and thorough investigation of the milk supply,
water supply and every other usual source of infection
failed to show any common carrier.

CONTAGIOUS DISEASES.

One of the most important and difficult branches of the
work of this Board is to successfully meet the conditions
that are constantly before us in the management of contaREPORT UF BOARD OF HEALTH  
gious diseases. We feel that the quarantine measures now
being imposed upon households afflicted with scarlet fever
and diphtheria are as strict as we can possibly make them
under present conditions and are often very trying and necessittae great financial loss to the family.

We have repeatedly found it impossible tn some families to isolate the ease and protect the rest of the family.
We are confident that the establishment by he city of a
hospital for the isolation and treatment of all contagious
diseases would annually save many little lives, be blessing
to many families who ean ill afford any financial loss whatever and aid the Board in carrying out the strict quarantine
measures that modern preventive methods demand.

SCARLET FEVER.

The number of cases of this disease is about the same
as last year. It is only fair to presume that the rigid quarantine measures established by the Board and the thorough
fumigation in every case have had much to do with this
disease.

DIPHTHERIA.

There was marked decrease in the number of cases of
diphtheria reported last year, but we regret nevertheless
that our death rate from this disease is higher than it should
be when we are confident that we have in the anti-toxin
reatment positive cure if the case is diagnosed early and
the treatment instituted, especially as free anti-toxin ean
be so easily procured in this city.

MILK.

The report of the Milk Inspector shows that he has
been active in his efforts to secure for the people of this city
a clean milk supply. This food product, so essential to
ehildren, is being carefully watched. perfect supply,

  REPORT UF BOARD OF HEALTH
however, can only be secured through the education and cooperation of all who handle milk. We regret that the constuner frequently neglects to take care of the milk after it
is delivered to his home, thereby defeating all our efforts to
secure clean milk for his consumption.

SANITARY INSPECTION.

To keep the city in sanitary oendition it is nevessary
for the sanitary inspectors to make frequent inspections of
all the vards and outhouses in the city and issue many orders
to householders to clean their premises. During the vear all
the bakeries, barber shops and slaughter houses have been
inspected. All applications for barns have received careful
attention.

. PLUMBING.

The report of the Plumbing Inspector shows the large
amount of work accomplished in this important branch of
munieipal sanitation. With the growth of the eity there
has been an inevease in the number and value of the building
operations and corresponding inerease in the work of the
Inspectors. The continued activity of the Board in compelling all property owners in sewered districts to connect
with the sewer, the constantly inereasing construetion of
sewers in unsewered districts, the remodeling of the plumbing svstems of old buildings and other ssary work has
so Increased, that there is very little time left for other work.

Report of Bacteriologist
To the Holyoke Board of Health:

Gentlemen :—I herewith submit my report on cases referred to me for laboratory examination during the year ending Noy. .

DIPHTHERIA. ,

We have been unusually free from cases of diphtheria
this vear. The total positive cultures numbered but  ,
Which is the lowest it has been for number of years past.
That the physicians are daily realizing more and more the
importance of nricroscopreal examination and the necessity
of taking swab in all suspicious cases is demonstrated by
the fact that although the positive eultures numbered but
 we had which were negative.

TUBERCULOSIS.

This branch of our work is growing rapidly as is shown
by the fact that speciments of sputum were examined
this vear as against three vears ago, at which time the loeal laboratory was opened.

Onee again wish to emphasize the fact that in eases
that are clinically suspicious single negative examination
should never be accepted as conclusive evidence that the
patient is not victim of tuberculosis, because at times the
bacilli are found after several negative eaxminations.

TYPHOID FEVER.

The mumber of ‘blood specimens submitted for Widal
examinations is small in proportion to the number of eases
reported as typhoid fever.

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH  t

It is to be regreted that all cases reported as typhoid
do not have specimens sent in for examination.

OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM.

I would again suggest that the physicians be compelled
to take smear in cases where there is discharge from
the eves of the new born. Should this Board pass upon
this matter favorably, will gladly furnish outfits and if we
sucd in saving but one pair of eyes year, we will be
amply repaid for the trouble and expense involved.

Respectfully submitted,
J.J. CARROLL, M. D.,
Bacteriologist.
