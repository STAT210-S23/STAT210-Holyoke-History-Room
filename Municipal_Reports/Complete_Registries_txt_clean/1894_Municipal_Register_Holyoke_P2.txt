come next year. They would increase the requirements of the department. would recommend the
addition of three or four officers to the force.

There is at present no regulation concerning the
pay that an officer receives while off duty. Whether
it is illness or some other cause, whether it is two days
or two weeks, his pay goes on just the same. man
would not have that in his private business. The city
should not. Each patrolman is given fourteen days
vacation during the year. In  the thirty-four
patrolmen on the force took days in excess of their
vacations. This year the vacation excesses have
amounted to days. Proof of more health in the
department. Still there is room for improvement.

STATION HOUSE AND LOCK-UP.

The sanitary conditions of the lock-up are poor
and need attention. bath room is needed. The
padded cell should be improved. There should be
more adequate provisions for the victims of mild insanity that are brought to the station. The room in
which the padded cell is might be cleaned and used
for this purpose.

DETECTIVE DEPARTMENT.

This department has been conducted during the

past year by Assistant Marshal Herbert and Detective

Mack, who have rendered valuable’ services, as the
records show. revolving cabinet in which pictures
and records of criminals might be kept, or an album
for that purpose, would be valuable addition to the
equipment.
POLICE MATRON.

The police matron’s report shows what valuable
adjunct to the department her work is. Her suggestions are admirable. In Mrs. Moynihan the office has
a capable head. Aside from the regular calls upon
her, there  much that is just outside which she
reaches. She has the co-operation of charitable peo| ple in furnishing clean clothing for her charges.
TRAMPS.

The tramp evil should have serious attention.
The department has no satisfactory method of dealing
with tramps. Holyoke has become favorite resort
for them, and of late the police station has been overrun with them. The quarters are insufficient. If we
must have them, simple charity demands better accommodations. The only trial to which tramps are subjected here is an inspection that assists the officers in
case of their committing depredations while in the
city. They should be required to work. Idleness is

a moral wrong. The greater number of tramps continue their existence, miserable as it is, in preference
to work. They make whatever community they infest
their victim. Some tramps follow their life through |
misfortune or necessity. They are willing to work. |
The others should be forced to. In Springfield a
method has been adopted that works admirably. The.
tramp who applies for lodging is given supper, Is
given bed and provided with night-shirt. He
must part with every stitch of his filthy clothing. |
During the night it is steamed and dried. In the
morning he is given breakfast. Then he must saw
two feet of wood. The result is that tramps are apt
to keep away from Springfield. Some such system
should be devised to relieve our city of the tramps ,
who are satisfied to spend the night in the comfort- |

REPORT OF OVERSEERS OF THE
POOR..
To the Flonorable, the Mayor, and the Council of the
| City of Flolyoke Herewith find the twentieth annual report of the
Board of Overseers of the Poor for the year ending
November .
As we remarked last year, we expected greater
number of applications for aid, and it has proved to be
as we predicted, as the total expense will show.
The need of an addition to the insane department
at the almshouse grows more apparent every year. We |
have recommended it for the past three years, as also !
better protection in case of fire. |
The outlook as regards the farm and its products
was very good early in the season, but the dry weather |
shortened the crops at least half.
The death of Warden Judd in November removed

| REPORT OF CITY SOLICITOR
fo the [lonorable, the Mayor, and City Council of the
City of Flolyoke.

GENTLEMEN: have the honor to submit for your
consideration my annual report for the year ending
November .

During the past year have had the aid and
counsel of the same gentleman who has occupied the
position of senior counsel since my election as City
Solicitor.

We have continued the policy instituted by us
when first we took charge of the affairs of this department, which has been to contest by trial all cases of
dubious validity brought to recover damages for personal injuries said to have been received through
alleged defective highways.

In the defense of such cases in court we have been
extremely fortunate, and we have no instance to record
during the past three years where the city has not
been successful when trial of the case has been had
before court and jury.

During the past year nothing has been paid by
this department in settlement of cases, and this isa
trifle better showing than last year, because during last

Report of City Soltcitor.  
year it was thought best to settle three cases at total
cost of two hundred and twenty-five dollars.

When this is taken in conjunction with the fact that
no reverses have been suffered by the city in any
court trial, it is hardly necessary to suggest that the
running expenses of this department have this year
been reduced to minimum.

Your committee on claims has been more burdened with work this past year than ever before, and
a number of cases have been adjusted after hearing
before it.

The advantage of this course is apparent, as it
allows the claimant to have the case passed upon bya
body of disinterested men, who, as rule, are more

| ready to respond to case which is actually deserving
than jury would be when acting under the instructions of the court. It also obviates the expenses incident to trial in the superior court, and in some cases
where the injured person has, owing to his misfortune,
been likely to be placed in the unenviable position of
seeking aid from the city, have suggested that the
matter be brought before that committee.

It seems to me, however, that to avoid fostering
this species of litigation, it should be the policy of this
committee to make the amount of damages awarded
as small as conscience will permit, because the petitioner is not bound by the award of the committee,
and if dissatisfied still has his remedy in court.

  Report of City Solicitor.

A committee consisting of his Honor the Mayor,
Aldermen Holmes, Connors and Burns and the City |
Solicitor were deputized to petition and appear before
the Legislature to secure the removal of that limitation
in the license law which limits the licenses to one for
every one thousand inhabitants in all the towns and
cities of this commonwealth except Boston. Our
efforts in this particular direction met with the same
success as in former years and the prayer of our
petition was not granted.

When the petition of Holyoke to the Legislature
for the annexation of that portion of Northampton
upon which the Whiting Street reservoir is located
became ripe for hearing, we found that the remon- |
Sstrants to that petition had pooled their issues with the
remonstrants to our petition for leave to take the
waters of Munn’s brook for an additional water supply, and it became at once apparent that discretion
would be the ‘better part of valor, so it was deemed
wise to withdraw the annexation petition and concentrate our attention to the more important one of securing an additional water supply.

The Board of Water Commissioners, together
with large number of influential citizens and the
counsel for the city, appeared before the Legislative
Committee on Water Supply to advocate the petition
for an additional water supply. Several hearings were
had on different days and at various times and  places,

Report of City Solicitor.  
and the committee visited our locality on two occasions to acquire such information as might be secured
by view; but, notwithstanding our apparent need of
water, the petition was referred to the next General
Court. Various influences and elements combined to
effectuate this result, among which may be mentioned
the ‘dog in the manger” policy of the town of Westheld in opposing our petition on the ground that she
needed this water for herself. |

The Water Commissioners are entitled to great
credit for the time and care expended by them in the
attempt to secure this desirable additional water supply, and it ts to be hoped that if the matter ts again
brought up this coming year, fortune may regard their

' efforts with more favor.

That the law business of the city has materially
increased during the past year or two will become
evident from perusal of the following list of cases
and other matters in which the city appears either on
the one side or the other. }

Lizzie Shepard vs. Holyoke.

This was an action of tort to recover damages for
personal injuries alleged to have been received from
a defective highway. During the present year it was
brought before the committee on claims and adjusted.

Margaret O'Connor vs. Holyoke.

on the easterly side of High street between Franklin
and Sargeant streets. Case pending.
John E. Clark vs. Holyoke.
John E. Clark and William S. Perkins
vs. Holyoke.

Both of these cases were referred to in my last
year’s report and are still pending.

Connecticut River Lumber Co. vs. Board
of Health of Holyoke.

The petition of the lumber company was dismissed and judgment entered for the city.

Mary Cronin vs. Holyoke.

This was an action of tort brought to recover
damages for personal injuries alleged to have been
received by the plaintiff owing to defective highway.
This case was tried at the March sitting,  of the
superior court, before jury, and verdict was
returned in favor of the city. The plaintiff took
exceptions to the rulings of the judge who presided at
the trial, and the case was taken to the supreme judicial court. The case was argued before the full bench
of the supreme court at its September sitting,  ,
at Springfield. The exceptions of the plaintiff were
overruled and judgment was entered in favor of the
city upon the verdict. This terminates this case.

M. Wilbur Smith vs. Holyoke.
Emerson J. Smith“ “

Report of City Soltcitor.  
Elbridge D. Barney vs. Holyoke.
Jonathan E. Collins “

The above cases are still pending.

John J. O'Connor vs. Holyoke.

As the questions involved in this case are ones of
law rather than fact, the court ordered the plaintiff to
file in court an agreed statement of the facts in order
that the questions of law might be properly raised for
adjudication. No statement has yet been filed, so the
case is still pending.

Christina Miller vs. Holyoke.

This case is brought to recover damages for the

care and maintenance of pauper. Case still pending.
Municipal Signal Co. vs. D. L. Farr,
Mayor.

Efforts have been neade at various times to have
this matter finally determined, but the representatives
of the signal company have usually had some good
excuse for delay. Case still pending.

The committee appointed to apportion the cost of
building the Willimansett bridge assessed Holyoke
one hundred and five thousand dollars as its portion
of the burden to be borne for this gilt-edged luxury.

The fact that Holyoke’s valuation is something over
twenty-five million dollars, while the valuation of
Chicopee is only about seven million dollars, should
have cut no figure in the determination of this matter,
but it is evident that this was the controlling factor tn

For more detailed statement of the above cases

To scan the above list of cases is to be convinced
that the most prolific source of litigation is defects in
the highways, due to accumulations of snow and ice
thereon.

This can be remedied only by stricter enforcement by the police department of the ordinance providing for the removal of ice and snow from sidewalks,
and if the example afforded by some of our sister cities
of bringing citizens into the police court who are delinquent in complying with the terms of this ordinance
and fining them for such violation were followed in
this city it might have salutary effect.

the same course would, if pursued by our own city, be
productive of good results, and would entail no additional expense.

departments for their hearty co-operation and aid when
the occasion has required it.

I should like chance to appear before the board

man who knows: I‘irst, that infectious disease including tuberculosis is far too prevalent among the dairy
herds for the well informed and thoughtful consumer
in the city to contemplate with complacency the necessity to feed his young children upon such milk as ts
usually his only available supply. Second, that the conditions surrounding the production, care and handling
of milk at the farm of the dairyman and those to
which it is subjected in the shops, distributing vessels and vehicles of the city vender are, through carelessness or ignorance, far too liable to convert the

secure that his little ones will not be stricken down
with the milk which he must provide for them. Third,
that the morbidity and mortality in cities among infants
artificially fed with milk, and very young children fed
largely upon cows’ milk, are usually excessive in the
warm season and are due ina large extent to intestinal disorders directly attributable to the irritating,
sometimes poisonous, action of the ferments generated by the bacteria which, especially during warm
weather, swarm in much of the milk supplied by the
venders. Fourth, that the nefarious and fraudulent
practice of diluting milk with water often loaded with
numerous species of deleterious and frequently noxious bacteria is widespread, particularly among city
purveyors. Fifth, that the dishonest sale of ‘separator
milk,’ as ‘skimmed milk’ and of skimmed milk as
‘whole milk’ are also frequent frauds played by the
city milk dealer upon the‘unsophisticated consumer, to
the great injury of young children whose sole or chief
nourishment is supplied by cows’ milk. The general
milk supply—a large percentage of which is customarily infected, polluted and fraudulent—is therefore
a very serious subject for the consideration of the

reason for the conviction that there is not single one

new knowledge acquired such practical importance as
it has in the relation of cows’ milk to the spread of
tuberculosis, typhoid fever, diphtheria, scarlet fever,
Asiatic cholera and cholera infantum.

REPORT OF CITY PHYSICIAN.
To the Flonorable, the Mayor and the City Council.

The following is respectfully submitted as the
report of the City Physician for the year ending
November .

The past year has been the busiest one since the
institution of the office of City Physician, although the
year has been very healthy one as will be scen by
the report of the Board of Health, yet made  
more calls last year than the year before, and  
calls more than my first year in office.

The only way that can account for this increased
amount of work is that in consequence of the hard
times many persons who formerly employed physician were compelled this year to look to the city for
medical aid in case of sickness. The cost of medicine
is about in proportion to the increased number of
Visits.

The total number of visits was and the cost

In addition to the above, during the smallpox
epidemic the greater part of the work of attending to
the quarantine of the various blocks in the city de, volved upon the shoulders of the City Physician. Why
the City Physician should be expected to attend to
smallpox as part of his regular duties is mystery |
have never been able to fathom. There is no statute
requiring or intimating that he should attend them.
Moreover, the care of smallpox comes under the duties
of the Board of Health and the statutes plainly state
that whatever expenses the Board of Health incur

Report of City Physician.  
shall be paid by the person afflicted, or his parents or
guardians, if able; if not able to pay it, by the city or
town in which he has legal residence, and if he has
no legal residence in the commonwealth, by the state.

Nowhere does it state that the City Physician ts
expected to have charge of them, but if he does render
services to them outside of his ordinary duties as a
member of the Board of Health, under the statutes, it
appears to me that he has perfect right to expect
extra compensation for whatever services he thus
renders.

During the year have examined fifteen applicants for the police force under the civil service law,
and filed the necessary papers.

I have filled out twenty-nine certificates of death,
after proper investigation in cases in which there was
no physician.

Over certificates of vaccination were filled
out for school children and mill employes.

During the year burial permits were issued
to undertakers for deaths occurring in this city, and
about fifteen permits for disinterment and reburial.

Forty-five deaths, of whom twenty-three were
males and twenty-two females, thirty-four were adults
and eleven children, occurred among the city’s charges
during the year. Three of these deaths occurred at
the almshouse.

praise of the diligent care taken of the city’s poor at
that hospital. The opening of their new hospital
building, which occurred during the summer time,
renders available to the community at large another
institution which is an ornament to the city and a
boon to suffering humanity.

City Physician.

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
To the Honorable, the Mayor and City Council.

The Board of Health respectfully submits the following as its report for the year ending November  ,
 .

The membership of the board remains the same
as last year. We organized in February with Dr. G.
H. Smith chairman, Dr. S. A. Mahoney secretary,
Timothy Sullivan as health officer, Joseph Murray
clerk. Mr. Murray was re-elected Inspector of Plumb| ing.

During the past year the alleys have been kept
in as presentable condition as possible. Under
present conditions it never will be possible to keep
them as clean as they should be kept. The alley in
rear of each residence belongs to the adjoining property owners. Accordingly all alleys are private property. Consequently no improvements can be made
until the owners give the land forming the alley to

| the city.

This board recommends that measures be set on
foot to accomplish that end. Year in and year out
this board has recommended that certain disease
breeding and pestilential spots called alleys be graded

  Report of Board of Flealth.

and paved. Annually that recommendation has been
laid on the table, or referred to some committee from
which it has never returned. contrast, shameful in
the extreme, is that presented on High street between
Hampden and Lyman streets. The street in front ts
beautifully paved and as well kept as any street can
be, but the rear view—! It reminds one of the
Irish soldier’s shine. Pat never shined the heel of his
boot though the foot was resplendent. ‘t Because,”
said he, ‘‘a good soldier never looks behind.”

So itis with some of our good citizens. While
the front of the block is well paved and cared for
they never regard the rear; there may collect pools of
stagnant water and all sorts of rubbish which no
department in the city can keep in healthy and presentable state until the city becomes the owner of the
alleys and gives them the attention they deserve.
This board hopes that some time in the near future
public sentiment will be enlisted to such an extent
that this matter will be promptly and thoroughly
attended to by paving and grading the alleys between
our chief business streets.

The force under the direction of the board  the
same as last year, viz., five double teams and twelve
men. The price paid per team is also the same, viz.,
$  per day. The experience of another year has
strengthened the board in its opinion that it is for the
city’s best interest to have the work done thus than by
the old contract system.

Report of Board of Health.  
The collection of house offal is still performed by
contract, usually given to the lowest bidder. The contractor this year is John J. Donoghue, who has done
this work under previous boards. His bid was 
per month. The contract calls for the furnishing of
two teams and two men for the entire year. bond
of  Is required of the contracting party. The bid
is certainly too low to expect rigid performance of
the contract's conditions. There have been numerous
complaints, all of which were investigated and rectified
by the board. Considering the lowness of the bid,
however, the work has been done remarkably well.
The night soil is still removed by A. S. Drew, as
in former years. His prices made with property owners cannot exd these figures :

It has been this board’s duty to annually call your
attention to the need of general vaccination throughout the city. Yearly it has sent in recommendations
that such be done. The board has gone so far as to
ask for an appropriation for that purpose. All, however, to no avail. The expected, however, happened
this past year. Smallpox appeared in the tenement
blocks of South Holyoke, and nearly three months
elapsed before the scourge was finally stamped out,
and then only by the enforcement of the strictest
quarantine rules, general vaccination of all the inhabitants of the infected district, and the closing of
the schools.

The first case was discovered February ina
family of nine, living in rear of Bridge street. It
was “concealed” case, i. e., the family, although
knowing the nature of the disease, failed to notify the
authorities or the neighbors. It was only by an acctident that it was brought to this board's notice. When
discovered the victim was in the third week of the
disease, and was practically convalescing. The weather ,
being intensely cold at that time, and the house being
so situated that quarantine could be easily established without any danger to the neighborhood, it was

Report of Board of Flealth.  
decided by the board to leave the patient where she
was. The wisdom of this act was demonstrated few

 days later when the children, five in number, were
stricken with the disease in its severest form. The
two younger ones, aged one and one-half and three
years, were in convulsions for nearly two days. If a
removal to the pest house had been ordered during
that cold weather, and with the pest house equipped
with an insufficient heating apparatus, the disease
would have resulted much more seriously than it did.
The board was just beginning to congratulate
itself that the danger had passed, when on February
  the disease appeared in the eight-tenement block
on the corner of Hamilton and Summer streets. The
source of contagion was traced directly to the first and
concealed case, for this victim had done the washing
for the first case, not knowing she had smallpox. This
problem now confronted the board: How were we
going to dispose of this second case? She could not
be left in her present quarters, as she was an element
of danger to the neighborhood. Nor could she be
removed to the pest house, the weather being still too
cold to trust to its heating apparatus. way out of
the difficulty was found by hiring from the owner of
the house in which the first case appeared room at
the rate of  per month. At that time this arrangement was very satisfactory to both sides. Again the
board was beginning to think that its efforts were

  Report of Board of Flealth.

about to be crowned with success, when on March  
it was startled by finding another ‘‘ concealed case in
a twenty-four tenement block on Summer street. In
rapid succession six cases of the disease in the immediate neighborhood were unearthed.

The board now ordered compulsory vaccination
of all the inhabitants of South Holyoke, and employed
nineteen physicians to see that its orders were carried
out. This work was rapidly and efficiently performed
under direction of this board.

The weather now having moderated, the pest
house was opened for the reception of patients.

During the epidemic the entire number of persons attacked was twenty-nine; of these three died,
one of smallpox, one of meningitis while convalescent,
one of pneumonia.

The cost of the epidemic to the city is as follows:
Quarantine officers, SQ  
Support of quarantined families,  
Furnishing of pest house,  
Provisions to pest house,  
Virus, sulphur, etc.,  
Reimbursement property destroyed,  
Nursing at pest house,  
Vaccination in schools and South Holyoke,  
Incidentals,  

$ 

Report of Board of Flealth.  

In speaking of smallpox, unconsciously the board
started in to recommend that the heating apparatus at
the pest house be attended to, so accustomed is the
board to having its recommendations annually repeated
only to be annually disregarded, but we are glad to
record that the lesson taught by this year’s experience
with smallpox quickened your honorable body to
repair and fit up the pest house so that today it is a
safe place to send case in any kind of weather.

Now we come to another of our perennial recommendations, and this is one of the old veterans, hoaryheaded and hardened by the experiences of many a
year's defeat, and this is convenient dumping ground
for the now noxious refuse from the city’s alleys.
Those we have at present are located on private lands.

! In consequence of the long draws required to reach
these places the cost of thus disposing of the city
refuse is much more than it ought to be. The locacations of our present dumping places are: First, 
behind the old slaughter house on the river bank ;
secondly, down below the old ferry; thirdly, on
Northampton street.

During the present year the desirability of obtaining some portion of the Dingle for dumping purposes was called to your attention, but the recommendation to that effect was referred to some committee
or department from which, as usual, it never returned.
Of course the most sanitary method of disposing of

;

  Report of Board of flealth.

such refuse is by means of crematory. The cost,
however, would be much greater than at present. It
is essential to the economical running of this department that some location situated within short
distance of the heart of the city be obtained and
placed under control of this board to be used asa
dumping ground. The board sees no more desirable location than that part of the Dingle south
of Maple street. Accordingly, it renews its recommendation to your honorable body that some part ot
that be obtained and used for that purpose.

During the present year the new plumbing ordinance, which was passed by your honorable body the
last part of last year, has been in force. It is with
pleasure that this board already notices general
improvement in that most important branch of domestic hygiene. Much of the credit of this improvement
is due to the zeal of our efficient Inspector of Plumb' ing, Mr. Joseph Murray.

During the year the board has issued revised
edition of itsrules and regulations and have distributed
them generally to the taxpayers and property owners.

The board has been obliged to serve only one
sheriff's notice before it could obtain compliance with
its requests.

The board caused the arrest and prosecution of
Elias Frechette for concealing case of smallpox. A
fine of  was imposed by the judge.

Report of Board of Health  

The board has been sued by Joseph S. Gauthier
for supposed damage to his property, arising fram the
smallpox quarantine. The damages are placed at

The city has been remarkably free from infectious
and contagious diseases during the entire year. During the past month considerable typhoid fever appeared
scattered throughout the city.

The following diseases were reported to the board
during the year:

In this table your attention  called to the large '
number of deaths occurring during July. Forty-four
of the ninety-three deaths in that month were among
children under two years of age, and not from
diarrhceal troubles, undoubtedly caused by poor milk.
Your attention was called to this same fact in our last
year's report. During the year the board sent in a
recommendation that an inspector of milk be employed
who will devote his entire time and attention during
the months of June, July and August to the milk sup-  
ply of this city. It certainly appears in the face of
such statistics that some attempt should be made to
reduce that awful mortality among the children who

Report of Board of Flealth.  
depend for their sustenance upon milk. At present,
practically, no supervision of the milk supply exists. The
inspector candidly acknowledges that at the present
salary, nothing can be done. Accordingly this
board renews its recommendation of last year that a
competent inspector be employed at reasonable salary, who can devote his entire time and attention to
the milk supply.

The board desires again to call your attention to
the sewage system of South Holyoke. It hopes that
some measures for improving the sewerage in that part
of the city be set on foot before it is again visited with
an epidemic of diphtheria, as it was two years ago.

The board desires to return thanks to your honor- able body for the many courtesies extended to it during the year.

 REPORT OF THE INSPECTOR OF
PLUMBING.
Gentlemen of the Board of Flealth.

As Inspector of Plumbing have the honor to
submit to you my first annual report for the year ending November .

Plumbing is that portion of the work about a
building that should receive the greatest care, both on
the part of the plumber, as well as the dweller in the
residence after the plumbing work has been completed.
It makes no difference how good job has been done
by the plumber, it must receive care and attention, for
by carelessness and abuse, on the part of the resident,
it can soon be placed, if not in dangerous, at least in
an offensive condition. Good plumbing will last a
long time if proper care is taken of it, but the abuse
that some of the plumbing of this city is submitted is
enough to ruin the best system put in. There are
some people so ignorant of the importance of plumbing about the house that they do not even keep it ina
decent state of cleanliness.

That the regulations governing plumbing and
house drainage is in the interest of public health, no

better reason could be given than by calling your
attention to the number of jobs of plumbing and ho use

REPORT OF CITY ENGINEER.

Zo the Honorable, the Mayor and City Council of
the City of Holyoke.

GENTLEMEN: In compliance with the requirements of the city ordinances it again becomes my duty
to report on the work done in my department during

the year  take pleasure in submitting the following, viz.:
| Work progressed on the schoolhouses in Elmwood
and Ward One until the weather became so cold that
it had to be stopped during February and March;
nothing was done, in fact, it was May before the work
began in earnest. The buildings were finished and
accepted in August. When the schools opened after
the summer vacation it was demonstrated that in Ward
One the addition of this eight-room house was not
sufficient to accommodate the large number of children
from the district and the school board was compelled
to hire rooms in different parts of the ward. This circumstance will oblige the incoming city government
to furnish ways and means for an additional schoolhouse. The new houses are provided with approved

heating and ventilating apparatus which have lately
been tested and accepted by the State authorities.

Many needed improvements were made in the
older buildings, for details of same respectfully refer
you to the report of your Superintendent of Public
Buildings.

Ventilation and additional heating was introduced
into the Park Street school. The tests were made by
the State inspectors and proved very satisfactory to
the State as well as to your own engineer.

In the coming year the State authorities demand
that other of the older schools be provided in similar
manner, which will require considerable money expenditure, and should be considered early in the season
(so as not to cause any interference with the schools)
by having all contracts let before long vacations commence and bind contractors to have the work completed before the new school term begins.

An addition was made to the present High School.
The writer recommended an addition furnishing double
the accommodations, but owing to the scarcity of
available funds this was not done; the incoming board
will be requested to provide additional rooms. As
with all possible additions to the present building only
temporary accommodations to our High School population can be afforded, recommend strongly the purchase of suitable lot and the erection of modern
high school building.

Report of City Engineer.  

Plans and specifications were made for small
hose house in the Springdale district.  This building
has just been completed.

As in former years of my administration, surveys
and plans were made of all sewers, accepted streets
and assessment maps as far as possible.

For all curbing set, shown in the annexed table,
grades and lines were given, the work measured up,
lists prepared, and cost of same ascertained. Assessments for same will be prepared during the winter
months.

Very few plans for the erection of buildings in the
fire district were submitted and approved.

BRIDGES.

During the year was ordered to prepare plans
and specifications for stone-and-brick bridge over
the third level canal on Cabot street. Owing to the
lack of funds this bridge was not constructed; but as
the Holyoke Street Railway Company has to pay a
large portion of the cost for the privilege of laying
tracks on same, this bridge will very likely be built
during the coming year. New bridges should be
erected over the second level canal on Bridge street
near the South Hadley Falls county bridge, and on

  Report of City Engineer.

Main street over the third level canal near South
street. If Jackson street should be laid out as public highway new bridge must be constructed over
the second level canal; the question of separating the
grades and the erection of new railroad bridge must
be considered in reference thereto.

In all my previous reports have called the attention of the proper department to the utmost necessity
of painting and repairing all our bridges. had a
report made by bridge expert and referred same to
this years highway committee, but nothing could be
done, as the appropriations were not sufficient. |
most earnestly recommend this to the incoming administration and hope that my suggestion will be
heeded before serious accident may occur. especially recommend the painting of the footbridge over
the Connecticut River Railroad tracks at the foot of
Dwight street, as there the iron is constantly exposed
to the acidulous gases from the smoke of passing
engines.

PAVING.

Asphalt block pavement was laid this year in High
street from Appleton street to Essex street, and on
Dwight street from High street to Maple street.

Dwight street from Maple street to Elm street
was macadamized. The road material was obtained
from Salem and rolled with hired steam roller.  

Report of City Engineer.  
recommend the purchase of roller, and if suitable
road material can be obtained in our immediate
vicinity (of which there seems no doubt), of the
erection of accrushing plant. The streets which have
been macadamized must be kept in constant repair,
and if the administration should decide to continue
the good work, it will prove to be economy if the city
owns the entire plant.

The Springfield road was worked to its width of
fifty feet to the West Springfield Jine.  Northampton
street was widened from forty-nine fcet six inches to
eighty feet from Ball's Corner to Dwight street.

All unpaved streets and country roads were kept
in as good condition as possible, taking into account
the scarcity of rain from early in the spring to the
early fall. For further details in this department I
respectfully refer you to the report of your Superintendent of Streets.

SEWERS.

Comparatively few lateral sewers were built during the year, but the Oakdale, Elmwood and Springdale sewer system was carried to completion and connected to the previously constructed laterals late in
October. This finished the largest piece of work of
the kind that was ever attempted as one job by the
city. For further detailed information respectfully
refer you to the report of the Superintendent of Sewers and the annexed tables.

  Report of City Engineer.
SIDEWALKS.

All curbing set and sidewalks laid are contained
in the annexed schedules.

GRADE CROSSINGS.

I recommend again the abolition of all grade
crossings, as far as possible.

NEW WORK FOR THE FUTURE.
PUBLIC BUILDINGS. |

All of our older buildings, except those repaired
lately, need general overhauling and should be put in
thorough repair, as was done with the North Chestnut
and Appleton and partly with the Park Street School.

The City Hall needs extensive repairs in floors,
ceilings and roofs. The floor in the large hall should
be relaid. The painting should be attended to in
most parts of the building from ceiling to attic.

The Park Street School needs painting, and ceilings in the second floor.

Nonotuck Street School needs ventilation and
minor repairs. :

The Highland engine house should have the cellar excavated under the front part of the building and
the entire building put in thorough repair.

The old Elmwood school building should be put
in thorough repair, as it will be needed in the near
future for primary grades.

Report of City Engineer.  

As previously stated, another school building is
required in Ward One.

Preliminary steps should be taken for the erection
of High School suitable to the present and future
demands of city of the importance and prospects,
and to which Holyoke could point with pride.

The school building in Springdale will need an
addition.

Your attention may be called to provide an engine
house in Ward Two.

An armory for the militia may be asked for as
has been agitated in previous years. The large hall
in the City Hall building should not be used for military drilling. ,

A sewerage system for the north Highlands should
be considered and constructed as soon as the development of that portion of the city can demand.

By considering only part of the foregoing recommendations you will agree that large expenditures are
imminent and hberal appropriations required in all
departments.

For detailed information in the city property department respectfully refer to the report of your
Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds.

The following show the expenditures in my de partment during the year:

obligations to all who have kindly and willingly aided
me in the performance of my duties, and refer especially
to the different committees which directed my work.
The kind and continued friendly attitude of former
City Engineers, the cordiality and friendship of the
officers of the Holyoke Water Power Company, and
the comunity at large, the assistance of your efficient
Superintendent of Streets and Public Buildings, all
helped to whatever success was attained in my department during the year.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON
ANNUAL REPORT.
To the Citezens of the City of Holyoke:

It is doubtful if the School Committee of this city
has ever encountered year more perplexing in many
respects than that which has justclosed. The unusual
growth of school membership; the unwelcome necessity of overcrowded rooms, and others occupied
against our better judgment; the slow completion of
two large buildings promised in January, but not finished until October; the necessity for asserting the
committee’s prerogative in providing additional rooms
in the High School building upon the failure of the
city property committee to carry out the behest of
the city council to that effect; the consequent large
increase of expenditures beyond our estimates and expectations,—all these, and more, have made the year
memorable above most others in our school history.

  Report of School Committee.
While the School Committee has intended to justify
its reputation for wise conservatism, it has this year,
as on other occasions, asserted its courage to follow
its convictions, even in dealing with hard conditions
and the use of unusual means. In considering the
events of the past year, and of few others immediately preceding, some serious questions crowd them- |
selves upon the attention of the committee relative to
their obligations to the children of the community,
and their bounden duty to see inforced the spirit of
the laws of the commonwealth. If it is our duty to see
that every child within our borders is afforded the opportunity of obtaining good common school education, in assuming such responsible duty there are a
few principles or conditions, of which we would set
down memoranda in very strenuous terms: :
First—We would insist that no person should
undertake the management of our children without the
requisite endowment of good character and proper
preparation for the work.
Second—We would not consider the selection of
even the very best of teachers sufficient provision
for the establishment of school, had she all the books,
maps and material for use which such teacher would
desire and require, if there was lacking suitable
school-room, pleasant to look into and comfortable
with warm, pure air.
 If we do not keep the first principle constantly in

Report of School Committee.  
view, the community can bring its charge directly
against us, for the selection of teachers is our own
peculiar prerogative, for the improper exercise of which
no citizen would ever mislocate the blame. But there
is doubt in the popular mind as to the provision of
the other equally important part of the educational
conditions. In short, when our school-rooms become .
overcrowded with pupils, and when schools are
known to be occupying unsuitable or unhealthy
premises, after appeals to the city government have
failed to effect the desired reforms, public opinion has
usually spent its force in criticising the city government, leaving the School Committee to the enjoyment
of sort of martyrdom, which perhaps it has no right
quietly to accept. Where at least part of the responsibility for providing suitable and sufficient school
accommodations has been placed upon the city councils, the school committees are inclined to make them
bear it, and are generally content to charge back the
blame and recline idly upon their failure. Just here ts
the parting of the ways. Is it the duty of the school
committees in such cases to follow in the path of the
city governments and let their schools suffer? or shall
they assert their conditional prerogative, as in the
recent case in this city? or will the enlightened citizenship ask of the Legislature such modifications
of existing provisions as will secure more prompt and
appreciative action in such vital matters? The fact is

  Report of School Commuttee.

notorious that many days, sometimes weeks, have been

lost to the pupils of our largest schools by the indifference, or lack of appreciation or promptness in answering the requests of the School Committee, and the

evil has become one of such magnitude as to demand |
abatement of some kind, either by more harmonious !
action of the two bodies sharing such responsibility, or

by the complete transfer to the School Committee
where final, conditional authority really resides.

The committee can report general progress in all
lines of school work during the year. We think we
have provided fairly, even generously, for the success
of instruction and general management in all departments, and we are pleased to applaud the special
efforts of many teachers to improve their methods and ,
to undertake new and untried ways at the demand of |
the proper authorities, or stimulated by the example
of enterprising associates.

The exhibitions of arithmetic work done in the
Hamilton Street building, where the experimental
course was made, and of nature study and language
in the Appleton Street School, where that course was
prepared, simply showed what can be done in any
school in the city where there is an ambition to excel.
Already these courses are gradually winning their way
to recognition, and, with suitable modifications, will
undoubtedly go into future schemes of studies for
primary and grammar schools.

keport of School Committee.  
Your committee of has found provision for
the large and constantly increasing number of school
children the most difficult of the many important
matters that have claimed our attention. The opening of two new schoolhouses, containing eight rooms
each, one in Elmwood and the other in Ward One,
does not relieve the difficulty, for, in the latter section,
we still have one school occupying basement room,
and three others in rented rooms outside of our own
buildings. As three of the rooms are unfit for teachers or children to occupy day after day, we recommend
the erection of temporary wooden building, one
story high, containing four or five rooms, well lighted,
heated and ventilated, to accommodate the overtlow
schools of the section until permanent structure can
be built. We also recommend that sixteen-room
building be started on land owned by the Hadley
Company, the completion of which would permit the
closing of the small Lyman street building, and give
to this growing section first-class grammar school,
such as is enjoyed by the children of other sections,
leaving reasonable provision for future growth.
More school rooms are wanted on the Highlands
and at Oakdale, and that at once, to accommodate the
children of those growing sections of the city.
As to the matter of needed repairs and improvements, the report of the Special Committee, addressed
to the city government, printed herewith, and that of

  Report of School Committee.
the Superintendent of Schools, will represent things
in their true light.
SPECIAL COMMITTEE’S REPORT.

To His Flonor, the Mayor, and the City Council of the

City of Folyoke.
GENTLEMEN :

The undersigned, Special Committee authorized
and instructed by the School Committee to lay before
you the condition of our public school accommodations,
and to urge that adequate measures be adopted in the
premises, respectfully present the following facts and
recommendations:

This city now owns and occupies sixteen school- )
houses—one, having rooms; three, rooms each;
one, rooms; six, rooms each; one, rooms; two,
  rooms each; and three, room each. As there are
now children in our schools, it is obvious that
the rooms would quite comfortably accommodate
them with an average of about children to each
room. This being the maxiraum number agreed upon
by our board for room, the fact itself would be
sufficient to justify immediate steps toward provision
for the steady and never-checked increase of our
school population, which will be between and  
children during the current year. But this school

Report of School Committee.  
attendance is not now equally distributed, as it will be
necessary to show:

We have clusters of schools in the several centers
of population, viz.: The Hamilton, the Sargeant
and the Park Street Schools, with children and
  rooms, are located in South Holyoke; the
Dwight, the Bridge, and the Lyman Streets Schools,
with pupils and rooms, are located in Ward
One; the Chestnut, the Appleton, and the South
Chestnut Street Schools, with their children and
  rooms, are located on Chestnut and Maple streets,
and between Lyman and Sargeant streets; the
Nonotuck and Ewingville Schools, with their  
children and rooms, are located on and near the
Highlands; and the South Street School, with its
  children and rooms, is located in Elmwood; and
( the Springdale School has its pupils in  
rooms. In the first section named above there is an
average of  children for each room, in the second children for each room, in the third  ;';
children, in the fourth children, in the fifth children, in the sixth children. It seems now probable that the first and the sixth sections—South Holyoke and Springdale—will require no additional accommodations during the coming year. The rooms of the
new Elmwood house are now all in use, but the two
rooms of the old house can be made ready for use by
improving the sanitaries, if required for use during the

  Report of School Comm ee.
year. Thus dismissing these three sections, your
earnest attention is directed to sections two, three and
four, where the rooms have been so crowded that, notwithstanding the opening of eight schools in base- ,
ments, stores and other unusual places, much incon- ,
venience is still suffered, and the progress of the
pupils is retarded.

In the Ward One region, to relieve some of the
over-crowded rooms, the committee has opened two
schools in the basement of Endeavor Chapel, one basement room in the Dwight Street Grammar School and
one in Fitzsimmons’ store on Ely street.

In the Hill region, the Appleton Street School
Hall is occupied by two classes and two teachers,
Goddu’s store on South High street has one class,
while the South Chestnut Street School classes are so
large as to render regular corps of teachers inadequate.

In the Highlands region, the fourth and fifth
grades have overflowed into the hall in the third story,
making two new schools, separated by temporary
partition. It has not been the intention of the committee to use this hall for ordinary class-room work,
but for the general purposes incidental to the successful conducting of grammar school; besides there
are architectural and other reasons why it is deemed
best to restrict its use to the purpose for which it was
designed.

Report of School Committee.  

It seems to us that the above summary makes it
clear that steps should immediately be taken to relieve
these three sections of present pressure, and to provide for future growth.

In these premises we respectfully recommend that
during the coming year new building be built for
Ward One upon the vacant land of the Hadley Corporation, if practicable, of such dimensions as to permit the abandonment of the Lyman street premises to
the purpose of the fire department; that new house
be built in Oakdale, suitable in size and location, to
afford temporary relief to the Appleton, South Chestnut and Nonotuck Street buildings, and that high
school site be procured and plans adopted for new
high school, in order that the present inadequate
structure may be given up, as soon as practicable, to
grammar school use.

We also recommend that accommodations at the
High School be increased by the addition of another
story to the recent addition, to afford room for the
laboratory still kept in the basement, to the serious
injury of the teachers’ health, and to accommodate the
senior class, which still occupies the hall platform.

"  Report of School Comm ee.

As to the old story of our High School, the committee would urge the people of all classes to see and
talk with members of the city government and tell
them what they want, for it is an old saying, ‘* What
the people want, they will have,’ and certainly we
want new high school, and that immediately. Let
the people and their representative in the city government consider the benefits to come to their boys and
girls from commodious, fully-equipped high school !
Many young men want the benefit of first-class
business course, but cannot have it now. The committee earnestly requests and hopes that the people of
the city will let themselves be heard and act with
determination on the question of new high school at
once. The committee have every reason to say that
we have good, progressive Superintendent, good
principals over all our schools, and an excellent corps
of teachers, both special and class, and it is surely bad
policy to leave this department at disadvantage for
lack of schoolhouse accommodations. We are well
aware that large amount of money will be required
for new buildings and that the past year has been one
of heavy expenditures, but in growing city like Holyoke this cannot be avoided, and we feel that the
people will support us in endeavoring to provide suitably for their boys and girls growing up.

We have good training school, where persons

of all classes can obtain the special qualifications

Leeport of School Conm ee.  
necessary for public-school teachers. The school and
its management deserve praise for excellent work and
for the bright teachers who have left it for service in
our schools.

We think the night schools have done good work
this year. The long debated project of employing
more male teachers was carried out with satisfactory
results. There was much smaller registration of |
pupils than usual, on account of the temporary removal
of young people from the city, but the average attendance was about the same as usual. Evening school
attendance seems difficult matter to regulate, and if
some system could be arranged to interest the pupils
and hold them till the end of the term, it would greatly
encourage the teachers.

The evening draughting school, under its new
principal, is doing fine work.

Your committee would hke to say to the parents
of the city, ‘‘ Visit the schools.” It  not necessary to
go with the idea that you must examine the pupils and
also the teachers; drop in ina quiet way at any time
and the teachers will welcome you and show you
what they are doing. Such visits will also make the
children do better. We will close the report by saying
we have an excellent corps of teachers, and the board
has been pleased with their work. In making forty

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON EVENING SCHOOLS.

The evening schools were opened on the  th of
October and closed  st of December, making ten
weeks in session. The enrollment of pupils fell somewhat below that of last report. The number being
 as against for  The percentage of
attendance also fell short of the previous record about
  percent. In the judgment of your committee the
general character of the schools has been better than
in previous years. Those who have attended have
been, as rule, orderly and manifested desire to
learn. The Springdale school has had the smallest
attendance, in fact the attendance hardly justified the
expense of keeping the school open. This year your
committee departed somewhat from the usual custom
and employed greater proportion of male teachers,
and, we believe, with beneficial results.

The cost of maintaining the schools has been
about per capita. Your committee is not alto  Report of School Commtuttee.
gether satished with the results obtained in our even- |
ing schools; the per cent of attendance is not as large
as it should be. Parents, whose children work and
help maintain the household, should encourage them
to attend the evening schools, and thus become better
and more intelligent citizens. The city incurs large
expense each year, entirely in the interest of those
who have no other means of education and we believe
the provision to be wise one. It should be the aim
of the committee to improve, by every means in their
power, the efficiency, and therefore look for better
results in the future.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON
DRAWING AND WRITING.

This committee can report year of good work,
with appropriate results in both departments—Miss E.
A. McDonnell continuing her seventh year of supervision of writing, and Mrs. Isabella H. Ferry her seventh
year in the department of drawing. The co-operation
of the class teachers has been gratefully acknowledged
by the supervisors.

It is the opinion of the Superintendent that the
regular writing-book lessons should ultimately be
dropped out of the  th and gth grade class work, and
the class teachers held responsible for the penmanship
of these classes, as attained in their composition work,
the supervisors being required to visit the classes as
occasion might require. The grounds upon which he
bases the recommendation are, that time can be gained
for other studies and that each pupil would be permitted to relinquish the imitation of the definite forms
of the copy-book letters and establish, under the super  Report of School Committee.

vision of instructors, the characteristic handwriting of
the individual. This is matter of some importance,
considered either way, and may well be weighed by
future committees as to whether the experiment is worth
trying, and, if so, as to the time. The penmanship of
the lower classes would have to be worked forward little faster than usual as preparation for the change, and
some scheme or standard of insfruction agreed upon.

The work of the supervisor of drawing has come

to have an important relation to the new courses in
arithmetic and nature study recently placed in our
schools experimentally, and the work shown in different parts of the city in these departments during the
past year reflected much credit upon the instruction in
drawing, and, indeed, could not have been undertaken
had not Mrs. Ferry’s department achieved its present
high standard of attainment.

Charles L. Allen, the successful instructor of our
evening draughting school for several years, removed
from the city, and the position has been ably filled by
Timothy J. McCarthy since the beginning of the
present term, October  last. The instructor has
continued the usual three classes, and followed the
courses pursued under Mr. Allen.

We were informed that several individuals desired
the establishment of separate class in architecture,
or architectural draughting, but it was not deemed
best, under the circumstances, to go beyond the three

grades of work already established, deeming it best to
lay good foundation in the elementary principles,
from which those who desire can readily find means to
pursue their several departments of work.

We have no recommendations to make for the
future, except that the board pursue in the future the
policy that has been successful in the past—retaining
and encouraging the teachers; inspecting and applauding the good work of the pupils.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON

MUSIC AND CALISTHENICS.

To the School Commtuttee of the City of Holyoke :

Your committee on music and calisthenics respectfully reports as follows:

MUSIC.

The method of instruction which has been adopted
the last two years has given great satisfaction. The
teacher, Professor Zuchtmann, who formerly taught
music only two days week, has been engaged for
three days the latter part of the year, on account of the
increase of our schools, and we recommend to employ
the teacher for the whole week to make success complete.

CALISTHENICS. :

We endorse the present system, as taught by
Professor Eger, in our schools, and recommend that it

Report of School Committee.  
should be continued, and that the teachers should
further assist Professor Eger as they have done tn the
past. We approve of the progress which has been
accomplished in all our schools, especially the High
School, but it could be improved upon by proper
accommodations, and therefore we recommend that
when new high school hall be built gymnasium of
good size and accommodations should be added.

without interruption until the work was completed.
During that period the services of some person was
necessary to look after the absentees from school, and
Mr. W. A. Moore was engaged by the committee on
census, attendance and truancy, as an assistant truant
officer. The duties of that office he performed with
entire satisfaction.

The school districts assigned to the officers to
take the census were and to the senior,
and and to the junior officer. When taking
the school census, we also take the population of the
city, and we are of the opinion that we have very
correct census.

The number of persons found residing in the city

  Report of School Commuuttee.

The following table shows the number of children
in each district, neither at work nor at school, between
the ages of five and fifteen, the total number being
 Of this number are under the age required
by the statutes to attend school, and are over the
compulsory age and are not obliged to attend; the
balance,  are kept at home. Out of that number
some are kept to mind house on account of poverty,
some for physical or mental defects. So we can say
with satisfaction that the number of children of compulsory age not attending school in this city is very
small. There is always more or less talk about the
number of children that stay away from school; some
people seem to forget that the parents have the right
to keep their children from school ten weeks, while
schools are in session, for their own needs or pleasure.
That privilege given by the statutes is the reason why
we see so many children on the streets every day, and
the power given to the truant officer is not sufficient
to keep them in schools.

| City Physician, of all places where any contagious disease found, and not allowing the children in school
until all danger of contagion is passed.
We visit the City Physician's office every morning
and ascertain if any case of contagious disease has been
reported, and if there has been, we then call at the residence where the disease is and quarantine the children.
Many cases of disease are found where no physician
has been called, and others by accident never reported
to the City Physician. In all such cases the officers
put up the proper card and report the same to the proper
authority. During the month of March, smallpox
broke out in South Tlolyoke, necessitating closing all
the schools for the remainder of the term. Another
case occurred at East street, April  On the  th
the Board of Health ordered all the schools below the
canals to be closed until all danger of contagion was
passed. April all the schools that were quarantined reopened, with the exception of the Precious

EMPLOYMENT OF MINORS.

We have visited the several manufacturing establishments in the city, as the statutes require, once during each term, to ascertain if the law relating to the
employment of minors was complied with. We have
great satisfaction in saying that we found, in every
corporation, the overseers in their respective departments doing their best to observe the law.

From December to December ,
the number of minors employed in the several manufacturing establishments was  which is less
than were employed from December to December J,  ,

TRUANCY.

It would have been great satisfaction to us tf
during the years and we could have found
the secret of stopping truancy; but we regret to state
again this year, that the number of the truants, as the
figures will show, its little higher than last year.

  Report of School Committee. |
During and there were truants with  
truancies, and during and we have had  
truants with truancies. It is only right to say
that the number of school children has increased  
over that of last year.
During and six boys have been discharged from the County Truant School and two were
sentenced to the same for two years. There are now
at the truant school eight boys from this city.
In conclusion, we thank you, gentlemen of the
school committee, superintendent and teachers, for
your kind co-operation in assisting us in the discharge
of our duties.
Respectfully,

The expenditures during the fiscal year just ended

own estimate by These unprecedented
results were due chiefly to unprecedented conditions.
The estimates were made in February last. During the
term which closed in December preceding, the membership in the public schools had been  and during January following it amounted to only  but
in October following the membership had become

  Report of School Committee.
the teachers’ monthly pay roll had increased from
$  in February,  to  in November,
 difference of Although consider- )
able increase of registration was anticipated and provided for in the estimates of February,  the result
proved that provision for the thronging classes was
quite inadequate. You have prepared and opened
two new schoolhouses containing sixteen rooms, comfortably filling every room with pupils, but you are still
compelled to employ double teaching force in crowded
rooms, and have eight schools in other than regular
school-rooms.

This brief statement accounts, In general way,
for the large and rapid increase of expenditures during the fiscal year excepting in the contingent list,
which ts increased by for addition to the )
High School accommodations,  for the rental of
school-rooms, improvements in several schoolhouses, |
and the incidentals necessary to the establishment of
so many new schools.

ACCOMMODATIONS.

I trust that the report recently made to the board
by special committee appointed for the purpose will |
be published as part of the report of the special com- |
mittee on annual report, in order that the public, as
well as the honorable, the city council, may fully appreReport of School Committee.

The others are suburban buildings, sufficiently
commodious for the sparsely-settled sections in which
they are located.

The above are the facts and figures upon which
the special committee has based its recommendations,
and they sufficiently emphasize the necessity therefor.

THE PROPOSED HIGH SCHOOL.

Every good citizen will favor taking the first steps
toward the establishment of new high school within
the next year. The phrase “newhigh school” is used
advisedly. As soon as the high school building is finished, the old high school” will cease to exist, and a
new establishment —new not merely in adequate
accommodation, but new in its courses of studies and
material and other means for their pursuit made possible only by such adequate accommodations.

The addition of another story to the north section
of the building will only take the laboratory out of the
basement, where it ought never to have been placed,
and will thus serve good purpose for year or so.
But this improvement, while it fails to answer the
present and prospective necessities for high school, ,
only completes the structure for fortunately located
grammar school, for which you can scarcely wait a
year longer.

Report of School Committee.  
THE TRAINING SCHOOL.

Elsewhere is published, as part of my report,
that of the principal of the Training School, containing
a brief but interesting statement of the management,
the results, and the needs of her school as disclosed by
experience. It is fact well known to you all, that the
school has progressed steadily toward the ideal set
for its attainment, and has undoubtedly made for itself
an honorable place in your general management.
While this is all true of the school, its limitations
should be frankly confessed. These limitations are
first in the scope, and second in the means and concomitant conditions for successful work.

First, as to the scope. It was doubtless well, at
the inception, to cover but the work of the four grades
of schools found in the Park street building at the
opening of the Training School, nor would it be possible in that building to add more than one more grade,
as there  but one vacant class-room, which room is in
almost constant use as recitation room for small
classes taught by training students under the immediate supervision of the training teachers. As the
organization and management were in some respects
new and tentative, the six schools of the four primary
grades, the three times six students, and the two training teachers were deemed sufficient to do the work, or
to prove the demand necessary for stronger founda  Report of School Comm ee.
tion and broader superstructure. To my mind two
facts seem obvious. The natural and acquired endowment of the students admitted for training are as various as the work of our various grades of schools from
the first primary to the last grammar. While doubtless each of these students should begin the career
with the study of the youngest children and the unfolding to them of the simplest truths—and some may
struggle in vain to go beyond—there are found some
whose powers and tastes develop in different direction, gratified with the operations of maturer minds
and the more complete presentation of the subjects
and objects of learning. But we have no room, nor
does our scheme afford the time for the advanced work
here indicated.
The students who desired or were qualified to be
advanced to grammar grade work would require at
least half year more of work, after finishing the
present course or such portion of it as might seem
necessary. Should it be deemed best now or at some
future time to extend the course into the grammar
grade work, the advance could be made gradual, and
each step proved safe before taking the next. But,
second, it is even more important that you provide the
means and the necessary conditions for the success- ,
ful training of the eighteen students now in hand, than
that the work should be extended to other grades, a
larger number of schools, and consequently larger

Report of School Committee.  
number of pupils. Among ‘the means” must be
reckoned teachers sufficient in ability and number to
instruct the students in their class-rooms and  laboratories, and to supervise the school-room management
and instruction in the six or more school-rooms. Our
two teachers end each term not only exhausted with
care, and mental and physical activity, but with the
profound consciousness that not all of the work that
can be done for the students has been found possible.
It is the opinion of those who have watched the management most carefully that with our organization
there should be at least one half as many teachers as
separate schools, and far better results would be realized with the present classes, to students and pupils,
by the addition of one more teacher to the corps.

But the concomitant conditions are important, too.
As this school is primarily for the training of students
in the science and art of teaching, it is true that whatever economizes its time or contributes help to its labor
is also important. The brevity of our course (a year
and-a-half) forbids an elaborate course of instruction
in geometry and physics, and biology and the sciences
generally. Themanner of presentation of the elements
of such of the sciences as are adapted to the several
grades of primary and grammar schools, is all that can
be reasonably expected of the Training School. The
students who intend to be teachers should come to
the Training School well instructed in the elements
of these branches.

  Report of School Commuttee.
The emphasis here placed upon one class of topicsmust not obscure the importance of others. Noone
deficient in any of the branches of good English education, as exemplified in the higher class of students
graduating from our high schools, should ever enter the
teacher’s profession, or essay the vain struggle against
their own nature, indifference or conceit, in the training schools of the state. Entering the training schools
without talents and without learning, unable to speak
and write good English, never having even opened the
portals of the senses upon the world of creation, what
can such blind leaders of the blind do for the children and youth of the Commonwealth! These are
- entitled to the very best of service, because they are
expected to yield back to the Commonwealth the fruits
of the best culture—fair living and competent citizenship. One more concomitant of successful work at the
training schools seems worthy of note. All instruction
imparted to the students in the lecture room or elsewhere is exemplified and emphasized by practice with
the children to whom it relates it is therefore important that the students should obtain the results promised
by their instructor and anticipated from their own mastery of principles. The ever changing conditions of
the classes of our Training School render the results too .
difficult of attainment and nearly impossible of appreciation, and constitute very serious defect of the
school, which should in time be remedied.

Report of School Committee.  
MANUAL TRAINING.

The following act of the Legislature was approved June :

“Be it enacted, etc., as follows: After the first
day of September in the year  every city of
twenty thousand or more inhabitants shall maintain,
as part of its high school system, the teaching of manual training. The course to be pursued in said instruction shall be subject to the approval of the State
Board of Education.”

As there are many kinds of manual training, and
many places where good examples can be found, it
will be well to appoint special committee, or to
instruct the committee on rules, to investigate and
report to the board. The report of the commission
appointed to investigate the existing systems of manual 
training and industrial education made to the state Legislature in should prove an invaluable guide to
school authorities.

While considering the subject of manual training
for the high school and grammar classes, it would

seem necessary to embrace with it the subject of a
more elaborate, advanced course in mechanical draw. ing for which our special teacher has not time.

I trust, also, you will be able during the coming
year to give that attention to the subject of manual
training for all grades which has been long held in

  Report of School Commni ee.

abeyance by other growing demands upon your resources. No part of the book work of our schools is
more important to the pupil, whether considered asa
means of mental development, or as an aid in pursuit
of business or happiness, than would prove good,
logically progressive course in manual training, extending from the earliest years of school life to the last of
the high school.

The day of pouring in knowledge is past. The
child is now required to do everything he knows.
When he knows word he speaks and writes it. When
he has an idea he is required to give it expression by
voice or pen. He learns numbers by handling things,
and by handling things he works out the true relations
of things and numbers, giving exercise to the perceiving senses and that power of the mind by which judgments are formed and recorded. Nor does it suffice
to handle, to perceive, to form judgments, but all these
must be accompanied by oral or written expression of
the processes and their results. All educators subscribe to the philosophy that brings objects into the
school-room as aids in teaching number, nature and
language, to develop clearness and quickness of observation, and to fix valuable facts inthe memory. But
It is Just as important to know how to use facts as it is 
to know them. As it is doubtful if anything can be
thoroughly known until it is rightly used, manual construction has been devised as the necessary compleReport of School Committee.  
ment of observation, to fill the full measure of perfect
educational scheme. Cultivation of the observing
power alone fits the child for the enjoyment of the
objects of the senses, but teaching him to construct and
reconstruct the forms of things, doubles the power of
objective enjoyment, and adds the power of service.
Briefly and very imperfectly stated, this is the philosophy upon which are founded the modern educational
methods for the school-room. In subscribing to this
principle the educational world confesses that it had
long been educating and developing but one side of
the human character, leaving to accident, necessity,
and the future the task of awakening to constructive
effort minds rendered sluggish by listless observing of
(to them) useless things. In the earlier years of the
republic, every boy spent much more than half his time
in learning the trade his father pursued. Although the
school culture then consisted of the three R's," nearly
self-taught, the out-of-school occupation afforded the
observing and constructive complement, which together
have educated some of the brightest minds that have
enlightened the pages of history. Modern civilization
having exchanged the children’s birthright for the mill
and the machine, it is the office of the educator to
restore it, by affording, in the school-room, through
logical system and competent instruction, opportunity
for mastery of the princples of many trades, which so
far from weakening the ‘“ three R’s,” should strengthen
them by more practical use.

  Report of School Committee.
MISCELLANEOUS.

Elsewhere will be found memoranda of work done
on the schoolhouses, and the need of other repairs.
Most of our buildings are in better condition than usual.
The superintendent of public buildings has done large

 proportion of the minor repairs, and his work is well
worthy of your recognition. In this connection it will
interest you to know that he has set in our houses  
lights of glass, nearly all of which have been maliciously
stoned out by hoodlums. Some effort ought to be
made to abate this old and growing nuisance. Some

of this evil work is done in broad daylight, in
full view of witnesses, but the most of itis covered by
the early shades of evening when gangs of this peculiar
pest wander down the alleys and about unoccupied
buildings, seeking anything to destroy. This evil will
never be cured by the casual or occasional attention of
an Officer; if itis ever to be arrested, that must be
accomplished by some authority intending and determined to doit. Is that authority at the front this year?
Let the year determine. Let us save several hundred
dollars from the account of malicious mischief and
invest the same in paint and putty, to preserve the
city’s property and stop the winter winds. ,

The city has done generous work this year in providing modern approved heating and ventilating apparatus for the new buildings on Bridge and South streets

Report of School Committee.  
and for the Park street building. The Park street
building was before heated by direct’ radiation through
steam pipes belting the several rooms, and was not provided with any adequate means of ventilation. In
their general features the apparatus in these three
buildings are alike, viz: They have each two boilers,
from which steam is supplied to radiators laid in what
are called “stacks,” in convenient parts of the basements, to and under which stacks cold air ducts extend
through the basement walls, and from which stacks
other ducts carry the heated air up into the schoolrooms. From each school-room duct leads to general receptacle in the attic, where the power fan ts
located to exhaust the foul air from the rooms. Butall
this expensive layout would be of little worth without
the proper placing, in each room, of the inlet for hot
air and the outlet for foul air. These are placed in one
of the internal walls of the room, the inlet near the
top and the outlet as near the bottom as possible. On
account of the great importance of the subject table
is inserted elsewhere (table A) showing the results
of the tests lately made by Chief Wade and Colonel
Merriam of the State department. Some interesting
facts are disclosed by these tests. It is noticeable that
the number of cubic feet of foul air drawn out by the
fan exds the inflow of pure air from the heaters by
  cubic feet minute in the Park street house, by
  cubic feet in the Bridge street house and by  

|

  Report of School Comm ee.

cubic feet in the South street house. This surplus air
must come partly from the corridors through crevices
around the doors, which, if pure, does no harm. But
a large proportion of it is forced up through the floors
or in through outer walls and windows, some of it in
not very good condition as to purity or warmth. Buildings having or about to have this excellent method of
heating and ventilating should be properly prepared
therefor by excellent carpentry or masonry, or both,
and after construction no crevices in the ducts should
be permitted to check the draft of foul air from the
rooms. Another point. The State authorities do not
require us to furnish to each pupil more than cubic
feet of air per minute.

Although our standard number of pupils per room
is only  let us provide for surplus of  Then
with pupils in room we would need to furnish
only cubic feet of pure air per minute per
room. But the amount of airdrawn out of the Park
street rooms by the fan averages feet per minute
per room, from the Bridge street rooms  and from
the South street rooms cubic feet of air per minute. The inevitable conclusion from these figures is
that you are paying for coal to heat and for power to
expel per cent more air than is necessary in the Park
street house, per cent more in the Bridge street
house and per cent more in the South street house,
and if rightly recall the Appleton street house tests,

Report of School Committee.  
about per cent more there. Now these facts are
not figured out for the fun of it. They have good
and comprehensable basis, and think there are men
even in our midst, who will yet be able to construct
such an apparatus as will save this waste and give the
desired results. ,

If the new heating system is to be placed in any
of the other schoolhouses during the coming year, the
Park street plant is worthy of inspection for economy
and noiseless working. trust the committee will
undertake the reconstruction of the Smead Northcote system in the Hamilton street building, applying
the more modern principle of internal wall exits,
the only thing wanting to its success at the outset. If
this change had been made instead of putting in the
elaborate steam plant which we now have, the system
would have been success and we would have there
nearly as good ventilation as any schoolhouse in this
city affords. The old furnaces, fitted with hard coal
grates, can be made as good as new, and will probably
heat the building without the boilers, one of which could
be taken to the Sargeant Street School and the other
to the Nonotuck, when the new system shall be applied to those buildings.

The cost of remodeling the Smead Northcote |
system would not be far from In placing these

air ducts from outside, when the buildings are not
occupied, as is the case with the Smead Northcote
and Fuller Warren systems, with which provision
the air can be drawn through the apparatus, when the
buildings are not occupied, as many times as may be
desirable. Also, larger ducts and stronger exhaust
should be provided for the sanitaries. Possibly the
inlet ducts so cunningly devised for the new buildings,
running directly through the outside wall and opening under common radiator had better have been led up directly from the basement, where the air is always warm.

If you appoint special committee on manual
training, attention should be given to the experimental
work done in the room of Miss Holmes at the Dwight
Street School, of which report is found elsewhere.
Her success should encourage others to do likewise.
Most of our buildings are well adapted to receive the
material or apparatus for cooking, carpentry, etc., and
invite the voluntary effort of the pioneers.

At my request the reports have been contributed
by the principals of our High, Grammar, and Training
schools, and by the Secretary of the Teachers’ Institute, all of which, found inthe appendix, will repay
perusal.

I now desire to express to the members of the |
board the thanks of myself and the teachers for substantial and generous support and esteemed counsel.

Mr. FE. L. Kirtland, Superintendent of Schools.

Dear Str: In making my tenth annual report
there is little of importance to note. The rapid growth
of the High School continues, and al] the indications
point toward considerable increase in the number
of pupils. The work of the school in every depart—
ment is seriously hampered by the lack of proper
accommodations and appliances, and its progress Is
scarcely perceptible. Until new building ts provided,
the best we can reasonably hope for is to hold our
own. We think we have done that during the past
year.

Yours truly,

IMPROVEMENTS.

During the summer hardwood floor was laid in
all the rooms, corridors and hall. And it is worthy of
mention that this was accomplished at an earlier date
and at less expense than had been planned. The
graduating class held public exercises in the hall in
June, and placed in the office beautiful memorial
window. The city furnished grade one with new and
convenient desks.

WANTS.

There ts so much noise occasioned by the ventilating machinery that the discipline of the school is
greatly impaired and, besides, the drafts are so strong
that the pupils experience much discomfort. Colonel
Merriam and others claim that these difficulties can be
easily remedied. The citizens should take care that
the proper authorities attend to this important matter
without delay. The windows, old and rickety, should
be replaced with suitable ones. This would improve
the looks of the building and do away with the drafts
to some extent. Much of the furniture, handed down
from former generation, is inadequate to the comfort
and proper advancement of the pupils. respectfully
ask that the rooms of Misses Doty and Moriarty be
refurnished before the opening of another school year.

Report of School Committee. SI
TEACHERS.

In September Miss Moriarty, who has assisted
Miss Wilson for year, was given charge of room.
By this arrangement the first primaries can be
thoroughly trained. The large mixed grade was removed to the hall, and has been taught by Mrs. Webster
and Mrs. Smith. Miss Mary O'Connell, graduate of
the Westfield Normal School, and teacher of grade
eight for little more than four years, resigned at the
close of this fall term. She had been loyal and
efficient teacher.

NATURE STUDY.

Especial attention has been given to nature studies
and language in all the grades during the past year.
The topics studied have been germination, buds, trees,
leaves, wild flowers, fruits, building stones, minerals,
metals and animals. It is desirable that these studies
be graded as soon as the work can be properly done,
so that course of physics may be pursued by the
highest grades of the grammar schools.

So enthusiastically have the pupils entered into
these studies that the results in observation, thought,
language and drawing have been very gratifying. In
June all the work of every grade was exhibited on
canvas in four rooms, the office, and the hall. And
although small admission fee was asked, nearly seven
hundred people visited the exhibition.

§  Report of School Comm ee.

Some of our citizens generously contributing
money, prizes were offered for excellence in composition and drawing, and for the best collections of natural |
history. The following pupils received prizes Lizzie |
Chambers and Rena Richards of grade one; Eddie
Sickman and Bessie Nichols of grade two; Helen
Wood and Judith Holyoke of grade three Albert Sickman, Madeline Arthur and Millie Snow of grade four ;
Guy Sickman and Nellie Lathrop of grade five; Bertha Sickman and Willie Lee of grade six Luella Wood
and Fred Seymour of grade seven; Willie Chase,
Charles Newcomb and Cora Richardson of grade
eight; William Chadwick, Maud Murlless, Charles
Pearson, Ethel Wood, Edward L. Twing, Daisy Harding, Mamie Quirk and Charles Boothe of grade nine.

And here it should be stated that Nellie Lathrop
of grade six and Ethel Wood of grade nine received
this fall first and second prizes respectively from the
Horticultural Society of Boston.

COURSE OF STUDY AND WATER COLORS.

For the convenience of teachers there was compiled course of study in natural history, language,
morals and manners,and physiology. In June the School
Committee adopted this course for the use of all the ,
schools.

It was thought that the pupils would take more
interest in nature studies if they could learn to paint

Report of School Committee.  
So Mrs. Ferry, the supervisor of drawing, has kindly
taught, this fall, the teachers of the building and the :
four grammar classes how to use water colors. The
pupils are delighted with this work and have already
produced some very good specimens.
SUGGESTIONS.

Would it not be wise for the city to adopt some
course in manual training, and by special teachers give
instructions in all the schools? Nearly every school
could commence and do something in this line of study
until the new high school building could offer greater
facilities for work in the upper grades of the grammar
schools.

So many different branches have been introduced
into the school curriculum that it is impossible for any
to teach well all these studies. The solution of the
difficulty seems to be in departmental instruction.
One teacher may have charge of reading and language
in three or four rooms, another arithmetic, etc., third
of history and geography, afourth of science and music,
andso on. During the year quite number of cities
in the State have successfully tried this method. Let
Holyoke see what it can do along this line.

by the Holyoke Horticultural Society for the best display of wild flowers at their exhibition. The class
won the second prize, and were awarded special
silver cup.

For the past two years the teachers and pupils
have observed Arbor Day and planted trees and vines.
The trees were named for distinguished persons. On
account of the sandy soil the vines have not done
well; and the bed of flowering wild plants, which did
so well in the spring, was scorched beyond help before
the autumn term.

This building needs better ventilating system,
and more rooms to accommodate the pupils in this
district.

In closing, wish to thank the Superintendent
and Committee for their generous support.

  Report of School Committee.
Superintendent E. L. Kirtland:

The report of the South Street Grammar School
for the year will necessarily be very brief. Owing
to delay in finishing the new building it was September |
  before the organization of the school was begun.
On that date the five grades from the old Elmwood
School were transferred to the new building. The fol- lowing day the upper grades were openedand theschool
stood fully organized, with membership of  It
had been intended to have two double grades and
accordingly grades six and seven were placed in one
room, as also grades eight and nine. The latter filled
up much more rapidly than had been anticipated, however, and it was soon found necessary to place them in
separate rooms, thus making two grades of thirty-four
and twenty-six respectively. Since the opening of the
school accessions have been constant, the growth being
particularly marked in grade one. Grades six and seven
are still in one room, though somewhat crowded, there
being forty-five desks for forty-nine pupils, four of the
number being seated in chairs without desks. Although
the accessions to these grades are not so numerous as
in some of the lower ones, it still seems likely that
they will have to be separated soon. At present the
school is occupying every room in the building, eight ‘
in all, with total membership of  The district

’ removals it is reasonable to expect that the numbers

will continue to increase fully as rapidly as in the preceding three months. That the old building will have
to be occupied again by spring seems foregone
conclusion, as grade one, with sixty seats, already contains fifty-four pupils and  fast growing in numbers.

The building being new affords some advantages,
as well as some disadvantages. Chief among the former
may perhaps be reckoned our heating and ventilating
apparatus, which, although somewhat troublesome at
first, now seems to be working’ satisfactorily. The
sanitary arrangements do not seem to be all that
could be desired as yet, but doubtless they too will
be satisfactorily regulated in time. What we feel now
as our greatest lack is good reference library for use
of the teachers and pupils. Thanks to the generosity
of Mr. W. E. Walther and other friends beginning
has been made, from which, we trust, may spring
something adequate to our needs.

ARITHMETIC.

During the past year we have given much thought
to the subject of arithmetic, to the different methods
employed in teaching it, and the results to be obtained.
By making use of that correlation of topics, which exists
in arithmetic as in all other studies, we are trying to {
spend less time on the subject and yet at the end of the |
year to show better results. Two opposite views are |
held in reference to what should be taught in arithmeReport of School Comm ee.  
tic. Some believe that the aim should be to reach only
those topics which will be used by the pupils in after
life. Others believe that the chief value of arithmetic
is the discipline and the training of the reason that
come from its study. While it seems that the latter
view  the more correct one, it is nevertheless true
that this subject should be made more practical, and
that the pupils should receive more practice and drill
in the essentials of arithmetic than has been the case
in the past. During the year we have had many conversations with manufacturers, bankers, merchants,
book-keepers, and mechanics with view of finding
out the business methods employed by them in transacting their affairs. In many cases better methods
were discovered than those given in our text books.
By making wise use of these methods we are sure
that improvement is being made in arithmetic.

NATURE STUDY.

The course in nature study, which was placed in
our hands last June, is now firmly established. Asa
result of its introduction the pupils are beginning to
observe more intelligently, to seek for the cause and
reason of things observed, and to express their conclusions in fair and readable compositions. Teachers and
pupils are pleased with the study and its results.

  Report of School Commtittee.
MANUAL TRAINING.

Last year we tried as an experiment the Northampton course in manual training. This course is
working admirably. Wesee great improvement in the
pupils in the accuracy with which they take the dictations and the skill with which they do the cutting.
This accuracy and skill manifests itself in other lines of
work and thus helps other departments. The pupils
are receiving valuable training which will fit them to
enter the Holyoke Manual Training School, as soon as
it  started.

WANTS.

It is absolutely necessary that some system of ventilation should be placed in the building at once. It is
at present the only school-building in the city, which
is wholly unventilated. The air and odor throughout
the building are at times unbearable.

Since the building was erected there has been no
sidewalk to the side entrances. The pupils are obliged
to wade through snow, water and mud to reach the
door. This could be remedied at slight expense.
Again would call attention to the need of side entrances to the basement. Here warm and safe playrooms should be provided, where the pupils who come
early could stay until school time. Many pupils are
sent from home by their parents as early as eight
o'clock in the morning, and they are obliged to wait in
the cold and storms until the hour of opening the building arrives. The basement has been examined and it
has been found to be an easy matter to build such
entrances. Why can they not be built at once?

month of October,  the Bridge Street School was
opened and relieved this school somewhat. But shortly
afterward large number of pupils returned who had
remained away during the previous month, and we
found it necessary to open room in the basement of
the building and two rooms in Endeavor Chapel, which
goes to show very clearly the need of more school
room accommodations in this district.

Report of School Commtuttee.  

During the last vacation the unsightly wall paper
was removed and the walls of all our rooms were
painted and the building put in state of good repair.
Gas fixtures for the use of the evening schools have
also been put in.

Owing to the overcrowding of the lower-grade
schools at the beginning of the term, an additional
teacher, Miss M. L. Cavanaugh, was appointed, and
the vacant room in the building was once more
opened.

PLUSH MAPS,

different colors, to represent the different counties and
states. The idea has been introduced in this school,
and many of these maps have been made by the pupils
in some of the higher grades.

It cannot be maintained that these can furnish as
good an idea of form as is obtained from moulding,
with elevations of mountains, etc., yet they furnish
valuable knowledge of the outlines of states and
nations, while the nice material used and the many
colors blended create love for the beautiful, and thus
help to cultivate the aesthetic taste of the pupils.

SCHOOL LIBRARY.

A good library for pupils and teachers  an essential part of large school. But there is no definite
provision to meet the expenses in this line. As no
convenient place could be secured for school exhibitions they were abandoned many years ago, and
therefore the revenue from that source has been lost
to the school. The appropriations for the schools
have been limited, and do not contemplate any more
than the necessary and common supplies in the common branches. The wider fields of research are
demanding library of reference books, many of
which are expensive, and therefore beyond the reach
of the school. Some steps are being taken to raise a
fund to meet the general demands of the school. A
historical lecture was recently given with this end in

Report of School Comm ee.  

view, and about forty dollars was realized and turned
into the school fund.

The following books have been recently added to
the Teachers’ Library:

Bryant's Poems; Whittier’s Poems; Longfellow’s
Complete Poems; Thayer's Ethics of Success, for
Lower Grades; Same for Higher Grades Grasses
and Forage Plants; White's School Management ;
Mistakes in Teaching (Hughes) Talks on Psychology (Welch); Kilburn’s Manual of Elementary Teaching; Gray’s Lessons in Botany Dana’s How to Know
the Wild Flowers; Spaulding’s Introduction to Botany; Gray’s Botany for High Schools; Flagg’s A
Year with the Trees; Entomology for Beginners ;
Portraits and Principles; Trees of Northeastern
America.

CONCRETE WALK.

The street in front of the school was cut down |
few years ago. This left the walk from the street to
the school steps much higher than the street. This
matter was remedied the past summer, but in very
unsatisfactory way. The entire walk inside the
grounds was cut down, and thus made much lower
than the ground on either side. In stormy weather ,
this walk is like the bottom of canal. The banks on
each side have washed down into the walk, carrying |
bushels of sand. As the snow melts, the water runs

  Report of School Committee.
into the walk and freezes. In fact, the walk is drain
for portion of the school premises.

Several steps were added to the old ones at the
entrance. This will be felt very seriously in the fire
drill. As the walk is now, the pupils must go down
into this canal, and then climb its banks on either side
to reach the yard, which is, in some places, several feet
higher than the canal bottom. The proper way to correct this matter would be to have the walk filled in as
high as the ground on either side and place the steps
just inside the school grounds. This walk is enclosed
by fence on each side, which makes it impossible to
carry out the rule of the committee requiring fire
drill, unless the pupils are marched into the street
instead of into the yard.

FEWER EXAMINATIONS.

With the advice and consent of the Superintendent of Schools, the examinations at the close of the
fall term were omitted, and examinations will be held
in the middle of the winter term. It is the intention
to have two examinations instead of three in year if
this course is found satisfactory to all concerned.

NEED OF MORE CLOSETS.

There are only three closets for the boys and

three for the girls. There are boys and girls

Report of School Committee.  
in the building. It is hardly necessary to make any
comment on the above facts.

VENTILATION.

It is well known that there is no mechanical device for helping to ventilate this building, although
the state inspector has asked for this improvement.
As the matter has been passed over for two summers,
something should be done in July and August. Arrangements should be made at an early date so that
the work may not extend into the fall term. When
there are two full months for doing this work, and
when contractors claim it can be done in less than that
time, there can be but little excuse for interfering with
school work.

MISCELLANEOUS.

There are now two divisions of grade five, and
therefore there will be two classes in grade six next
year when those divisions of grade five are promoted.
This will make next year one more class than the
number of rooms in the building. Therefore it is now
evident that some extra school accommodations will
be necessary as early as next September.

MUSIC.

Professor Zuchtmann has made an effort to secure high standard of music inthe different gradesand
has met with success. The regular teachers have not

  Report of School Committee.
only seconded his efforts, but have, in some cases, done
much extra work. Miss M. C. Griffin has acted as
special teacher and given much energy and time to this
department. Asa result of these influences, together
with the excellent chart used, the standard ts high in
this department.
ANOTHER TEACHER. ,

The growth of the school called for another teacher
since the last report, and Miss Annie N. Miller was
elected.

MUSEUM,

The valuable museum of natural history in the
school has been enlarged by gift of collection of
butterflies nicely mounted in glass case. The donor
is Miss Heinritz, and the cilt is in harmony with the
interest she has shown in the work of the school.

TRAINING SCHOOL.
Mr. E. L. Kirtland, Superintendent of Schools.

Dear Sir: Since my last annual report, there
have been few changes in the Training School. The
brief statistical abstract herewith submitted will suffice
to show its general condition. These data do not
reveal certain urgent needs of the school which I]
desire to bring to your attention.

During the past year, two changes have been
made in the general curriculum of the city schools,
which radically affect the Training School, and promise
to render long-felt deficiency in its work matter of
serious moment to the city. By the adoption of the
new courses in arithmetic and nature-study, that which
was previously desirable becomes necessity;  e.,
that the pupils in the Training School be thoroughly
instructed in the art of teaching the elements of geometry and the sciences. In order to give this professional
instruction, general knowledge of the subject matter
of the branches involved ts necessary. Such knowledge cannot be acquired by students in the Training
School during the present course of sixty weeks, and
under the limited number of teachers now employed.

  Report of School Comm ee.

It is impossible for the Tratning School to give
both academic and professional] training. The utmost
it can do in addition to its practice work and its instruction in strictly professional lines is to secure brief
review of subjects already known. Even this ts attainable only through the connection of these subjects
with the practice work. Since the practice schools at
present include only primary grades, the opportunity
for reviving knowledge of subjects before studied, is
inadequate. It is evident that the preparation which
students bring to their training work is matter of vital
importance to themselves and tothe city. The need
of more definite and uniform preparation on the part
of those who enter the school has been increasingly
felt with each added year of its existence, and the practical impossibility of retrieving deficient knowledge of
subject matter, even in the case of the most intelligent
and well prepared students, has been demonstrated in
the past year. During this time an unusually efficient
class has been obliged to complete its course without
instruction in geology, mineralogy, physics, or geology,
and with but slight knowledge of geometry, botany,
physiology and chemistry. The demand for definite
preparation is thus seen to be as imperative for High
School graduates as for others. Of the High School
students who have come to us in the past year per
cent have had no knowledge of the sciences, without
which, intelligent teaching of geography and nature

Report of School Committee.  
study is impossible per cent have had no instruction in geometry, now requisite in lowest primary
work, and per cent have taken no course in general
history, the basis of that wider information and  living
interest which insures enthusiasm in teaching.

Such lack of uniformity in the preparation of students must needs have been in the early years of the
Training School, before its permanence was established or its work and requirements determined. The
difficulty no longer exists. The needs are clear and
definite. The excellent instruction in our High School
affords ample means for meeting them. Its courses
as arranged at present, believe, permit full preparation forthe Training School. The failure to secure
this seems sometimes to be due to personal indecision
in regard to entering the Training School until the
High School course is nearly completed, but in many
cases to lack of knowledge of what is desirable or
necessary as preparation. |

I urgently recommend that some measures be
taken to require of High School students who purpose to enter the teachers’ profession through the Training
School, course of study covering the five broad subjects of general culture and special information involved in the work of our primary and grammar
schools,  e., English language and literature, general
history, mathematics, embracing algebra and geometry,
the elements of all the physical sciences and some for  Report of School Committee.
eign language, as well as full high school course in
drawing and music. knowledge of these branches
or fitting equivalents is demanded from all nongraduates of high schools. It  an error to suppose
that such knowledge is any less essential for those who
have the advantage of high school education.
Allusion has been made to the limitations of the
practice work and course of training. Experience  s
demonstrating the inadequacy of year and half of
"training in primary practice schools to properly equip
teachers for all grades of work. At present the Training School gives little more than primary training with
some slight practice in intermediate grades. Certain
students show marked capacity for primary work.
Others give promise of excelling in advanced teaching.
To the latter we can afford no opportunity for thorough
preparation in advanced work. Much excellent material that might be utilized in the higher grades of our
school is going to waste. While the principles of
education and the instincts of instruction are alike in
all grades, the ready skill and fresh information needful to the inspiring guidance of older boys and girls is
rarely possible to the young teacher except through
recent practice and review of studies to be taught, :
however well grounded she may be in the theory of i
education. It will add much to the efficiency of the |
Training School and its service to the city when an :
opportunity for such higher training can be given. At |

Report of School Committee.  
present no graduate student is properly equipped for
the higher grades of school work. partial step
toward this advanced training has already been taken
in the transfer to the Training School of fourth grade
school from the Sargeant strect building, giving now
two lowest primary practice schools and two of the
more advanced intermediate grades.

While these needs are prominent the school has
been making steady progress toward greater unity of
organization and efficiency of instruction.

The practice work during the middle period has
been increased and rendered more varied, definite
course of instruction under the special teacher of calisthenics has begun and the children of the practice
schools have been given less tluctuating and more
forceful teaching than in the first years of the training
work.

THE TEACHERS’ INSTITUTE. |

January Mrs. I. H. Ferry, teacher of
drawing, addressed the teachers of grades one and two
on Drawing.

Icbruary  Mrs. I. PL. Ferry addressed the teachers on [listoric Ornament. The address was exdingly interesting and instructive.

Drawings may be classified as constructive, pictorial and decorative.

Historic ornament represents the best ornament
of the past. Its study by the child will cultivate a
taste for the beautiful and correct ideal thereof, and
the ability to reject the crude and awkward.

The borders on crude antique pottery Wlustrate the
beginnings of art. These simple designs may profitably be reproduced by first grade pupils, and they may
thereby learn the first) principle of decoration—repetition. This principle ts to decoration what rhythm is
to music. Pupils on this elementary work should work
first with sticks and then on paper. Second year
pupils may do the same work with new materials, using |
the faces of solids they study, the triangle, rectangle
and circle. Another principle may be introduced,

Report of School Committee.  
alternation. Alternation may be of size, form, or
position. third principle has been introduced, symmetry. Repetition, alternation, symmetry, are the
basis of good design.

. Inthe third year pupils may take up quatrefoil
and Greek cross; in the fourth, square quatrefoil and
Moorish heart-shaped figure; in the fifth, oblong quatrefoiland Moorish figure; in the sixth, wove scroll and
Gothic leaf; in the seventh, Gothic Fleur-de-lis; in the
eighth and ninth, lotus and anthemion borders. Two
leading principles have been prominent in most styles,
symbolism and iestheticism.

Ieyptian is the oldest art and is purely symbolic
and conventional. “All Egypt isthe gift of the Nile.”
Naturally the river entered largely into its ornament ;
the lotus which grew thereon was used in decoration
as well as the papyrus. The finest temples were in
Luxow and Karnak. Columns, the invention of the
Egyptians, represented the papyrus plant.

Greek art was derived from) egyptian, but developed free of religious laws. Symbolism was dropped
and wstheticism originated. The anthemion  the

| characteristic form initsornament. The purest beauty
and the most perfect taste are represented tn Greek
art.

Other styles are based more or less on the Egyptian and the Greek.

  Report of School Committee. !

The Romans acquired their taste for art through
conquest and brought Greek artists to Rome. Roman
taste was notas simple as the Greek, and gorgeous
coloring and claborate detail distinguished it. Egvyp- |
tians and Greeks used stratcht lintel; the Romans
took up the arch. Greek buildings were rectangular.
The Romans devised round plan. The acanthus
leaf was used for ornamentation.

While art degenerated above ground, new art
was developing below in the catacombs. The emblems of paganism gave way to those of Christianity.
Christian art wassymbolic. Its beginnings were rude:
Its elements were used for their meaning. The circle
meant cternity, the quatretoil the four apostles, the
trefoil the Trinity, the palm victory, the serpent the
fall, ete. In time it developed elaborately. Many of
the forms in-church ornament to-day are from this, the
Byzantine.

Sarecenic ornament is purely asthetic. The
Arabs had no artistic ideals of their own and hired Byzantine artists, According to law of the Koran no
livingy form, whether animal or vegetable, might be
represented. lence geometrical and conventional
arrangements had to be used. very elaborate
tracery was developed. Gold, blue, silver and red
were the colors most used. The swelling ornament,
so-called, is type form in this style. The Alhambra
contains the most beautiful specimens of Saracenic
style.

Report of School Committee.  

Gothic art expresses vigor and strength. Plant
life is its basis, the leaves, stems, knots and growth of
the plant being represented. Many pinnacles and
spires characterize it. Cologne Cathedral is the finest
example of Gothic style.

May  Mr. John W. MacDonnell, agent of the
State Board of Education, talked to the institute on
teaching.

Principles of teaching are few. The right method
for an individual to follow is difficult subject. Everything Nature produces to law, and so the education of
the mind.

The great question in education is: Flow maya
subject be taught so as to produce the best effect in
the mind?) There must be method in teaching. There
is no faculty in the mind that cannot find something

 in the world to train it. The human mind is the supplement of the world.

The question before the teacher in each study ts:
What is the aim of this study  ?) To cultivate language ?
The reasoning power? The esthetic side The moral
side?) The aim is to be determined by the use men
make of subject.

The object of history is to cultivate in pupils
judgment on the value of human acts. The method
of history is not to commit to memory facts, but to
bring out the consequences of acts.

In every way education should be connected with
life.

  Report of School Committee.

The experience of the past is that the practice of
forcing all pupils through the same course of study is
pernicious. proper course of study should leave
pupils free to take the subjects that they are best fitted
for.

June  Mr. H. B. Lawrence, of the Appleton
Street School, read paper on nature-study. The
paper opened with fitting reference to the great
American naturalist and teacher, Agassiz, and to his
work for scientific nature-study.

In the days of Agassiz, most educators believed
that the study of natural history should be confined to
the higher schools. Agassiz maintained that love for
nature should be cultivated in all ranks of learning,
and that no one was too old nor too young to learn
from the great book which God himself has given his
children, The spirit of Agassiz has found expression
in the Boston Natural History Society, which has done
so much for the cause of science.

The claims made for nature-studies are these:
The student of nature is led to examine and study
some object, mineral, flower, leaf, or tree. He
does individual work, and thereby learns self-reliance.
Nothing is told him which he can learn by his own
investigation. Thus his power of observation ts developed and cultivated. By comparison of objects, he ts
led to think and reason. He learns to delight in talking and writing about the things in which he ts interReport of School Committee.  
ested. Thus his studies become the basis of the best
language lessons.

The study of nature involves, first, cultivation of
perception; second, expression, including drawing,
oral and written language, spelling, penmanship third,
comparison, and judgment or reason; fourth, intellectual power and stock of valuable information that
may serve asa basis of scientific study in after-life.

Mr. Lawrence illustrated the method of teaching
granite, marble, trees and flowers. He then set forch
the course of study: (a) Nature Studies, (b) Morals
and Manners, () The Human Body, (d) Technical
Work, (e) Literature with Nature.

More detailed statement of the course may be
found in the useful booklet, Nature Study and
Language,” prepared by Mr. Lawrence, and furnished
the schools by the school department.

Friday, October  the forty-seventh annual meeting of the Hampden County Teachers’ Association was
held in the high school, Springfield. In the high and
grammar schools sections papers, ‘* What Can the
School Do for the Attainment of the Reading Habit,”
by HT. W. Small Palmer, and ‘t :xamination as Basis
for Promotion,” by W. E. Judd, Holvoke, were offered.
In the primary section, Miss I. TV. Sullivan, Springfield; Miss Georgia Frazer, Springfeld, and Miss I.
H. Ferry, Holyoke, talked on Nature Study, Drawing

  Report of School Comm ee.
and Color in Connection with Nature Study, and
Nature Study Illustrated.

lor all sections, Professor Zuchtmann, Springfield, treated ‘* Methods in Music for Public Schools.”
The address of the day was delivered to this section
by G. Stanley Hall, President of Clark University, on
the practical value of child study for teachers and
pupils.

November  Mrs. Elia B. Hallock, New York,
talked on the sensible method of teaching physiology.
The address was for the most part for the benefit of
the lower grade teachers, but not Jacking in instructiveness for those of higher grades. Brietly, physrolovy were better taught not technically, but by leading
pupils unconsciously to knowledge of the proper ,
ways of caring for their bodies and of ‘the most useful
foods. In the higher grades technical instruction in
physiology may be used.

Beginning in September, Mrs. Ferry has given
instruction in the Appleton hall to the teachers of

erades six, seven, cight, and nine in drawing. These
lessons are for the purpose of instructing those teachers in the methods Mrs. Ferry desires followed in the
teaching of drawing in their grades. The lessons have
been given every two weeks on Tuesday, and have
been faithfully followed by the teachers.

M. M.S. MORIARTY,
Secretary.

SUPERVISOR OF DRAWING.
Mr. f. L. Kirtland, Superintendent of Schools :

“A city is most prosperous when every individual
in it is doing what he can do best for the benefit of
others.”

How shall an individual discover for what he has
a special aptitude unless he has an opportunity in early
life, when preparing for life's work, of becoming acquainted with the many different paths which open out
before him.

A public school curriculum should be broad
enough to present this opportunity.

Paths should lead out from it in all directions.

How much it must add to pupil's self-respect to
find that while one path, perhaps the mathematical
one, presents to him almost insurmountable obstacles,
in another direction, perhaps nature study, or drawing, he encounters no obstacles, but, on the contrary,
finds pleasure in every onward step.

To take utilitarian view of the subject, is he not
just as likely to find employment, and congenial
employment, as another pupil who excels in geography
or history?

  Report of School Committee.

Much is included under the general head of
drawing.

It is impossible to represent an object correctly
by drawing unless its form is understood. !

Form study, then, must precede actual drawing.

Children have clearer ideas of form if they attempt
to make the form studied.

Clay is the most available material, hence its place
in the public schools.

Paper folding, stick laying, and the construction
of objects from paper or other material are all introduced for the purpose of giving pupils clearer and
more definite ideas of form and their relations.

When it is remembered how much other knowledge is based upon this knowledge of visible objects,
the importance of definite ideas and the necessity of a
habit of close observation becomes evident.

Then there are the different departments of freehand and mechanical drawing with their many lines of
development.

Again, color is an attribute of all objects.

Shall this be considered in representing them as
well as form ?

At all events some attention must be given to
color, with all its beautiful possibilities, if one is to
have correct ideas of objects.

It will be seen that the subject of drawing is a
broad one.

Report of School Commuttee.  

The possibilities are so great, and the time allotted to it so short, that ideal results are seldom
secured.

There is still much to be desired, and yet progress has certainly been made.

There ts more general interest in the subject,
and its importance and value are better understood
than ever before.

Drawing should not be taught as an isolated subject, but should be used as means of illustrating and
enriching all other studies,

The Committee of Ten recommend in regard to
instruction in concrete geometry in the grammar
schools: ‘From the outset the pupil should be required to express himself by drawing and modeling.”

Nature study loses half its value if pupils are not
required to record their observations by means of
drawings.

All those who saw the fine exhibition of nature
work done at the Appleton Street School last year will
agree that no written description could have given so
clear an idea of the characteristics of the flowers and
other objects studied as was given by the drawings,
and the pupils had to learn those characteristics by
close observation before they could represent them.

An examination of the work done in illustrating
geography and arithmetic at Hamilton Street School
will show the possibilities of drawing in connection
with those studies.

  Report of School Committee.

It is impossible that pupils should not have better understanding of each one of these subjects after
having done this illustrative work.

And such work is being done in all of our city

 schools.

As each pupil must see and think and express for
himself, such training cannot fail to develop his mental
powers.

The number of schools in Holyoke is so large that
the amount of time the supervisor can give to any one
school is necessarily limited.

The results secured, therefore, must depend largely upon the regular teacher.

If she ts interested in drawing, her pupils will be
interested also. If she considers drawing an important
part of the school work, it will be of importance to
them.

The best possible results can only be secured
when principal and teachers and supervisor are cordially and enthusiastically working together for the
best interests of the pupils.

This cordial co peration on the part of the teacher
has never been lacking, and there seems to be an
increasing interest in the subject, as the possibilities
of using drawing in other subjects become better s

“understood.

Our drawing may be said to be in flourishing

condition.

Report of School Committee.  

There is room for growth still, but it is growing.

The work in any particular grade is in advance of
what it ever was before.

Seventh grade pupils are doing what ninth grade
pupils were doing few years since, while eighth and
ninth grade work is more advanced. Very little copying is done. More drawing is done directly from the
object.

Advancement is being made constantly in the
right direction.

 And now just few words in regard to the High
School.

In manufacturing place like Elolyoke, no line of
study could have more practical value than mechanical drawing. )

Yet only one year course is provided for in the
High School, and, even for that, conveniences are
lacking.

Is it not advisable that four years course should
be planned ?

There are always large number who take freehand drawing in the High School.

Excellent work in light and shade is done,a class
in water color painting has been formed, and considerable talent has been developed.

ISABELLE H. FERRY,
Supervisor of Drawing.

SEWING, EXPERIMENTAL.
Mr. E. L. Kirtland, Superintendent of Schools.

Drak Str: Last winter, by your request, a
course of lessons in sewing was begun in the fifth
grade of the Dwight Street School, with view of
making the subject, at no distant time, part of system of industrial education in the public schools of

) our city.

At your suggestion, corresponded with the
teacher of sewing (Miss Fannie French) in the schools
of Quincy, Mass., who very kindly gave useful hints,
and, after examining various collections of sewing
done in the schools of different cities, and exhibited at
the World’s Fair in  course of lessons was prepared for this class.

The following ts brief outline of the scheme as
far as carried out.

The initial lesson included practice in threading

and holding the needle, using thimble and scissors,

, making knots, etc. Each pupil then prepared strip

of cloth on which to practice the different lessons.

The stitches taught were basting, stitching, back
stitching, running, and sewing on buttons.

Report of School Committee.  

Each new lesson was made the subject of short
composition, and the different materials used furnished
excellent topics for language work.

The boys’ work compared creditably with that of
the girls, and the whole proved very satisfactory to
myself and the pupils. Time spent in sewing, one
hour each week.

A complete course in plain sewing would, think,
require about four school years, and might be commenced in fourth grade.
