fund, for the payment of city bonds is much
larger sum than was appropriated in former years, but as
the large amount of short time bonds to mature in the next
few years will require larger sum to be levied by taxation
to meet these bonds at their maturity, and as it is as much
for the interest of the taxpayers that the city should be in
a position to meet all its obligation, as it if for their interest to have the tax rate as low as possible, respectfully
suggest to the honorable mayor and aldermen of the year
 to petition the legislature to amend the ‘‘ Holyoke
Water Act,’’ so that any surplus from the receipts of the
‘‘water department’’ after paying the running expenses,
interest, and appropriation necessary for the payment of
the ‘‘ water bonds,’’ would be paid to the ‘‘ Commissioners
of Sinking Fund’ for the payment of municipal bonds.

It will also be necessary to petition the legislature
for authority to borrow the necessary amount to finish the
new high school, as the balance available now to finish
said school is only .

Respectfully submitted,
PIERRE BONVOULOIR,
City Treasurer.

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS:

To the Honorable Mayor and City Council:

GENTLEMEN: In accordance with the requirements
of the city ordinance, the Board of Fire Commissioners
take pleasure in presenting their report for the year ending
December .

The board organized February Ist,  by the election of Charles L. Newcomb as chairman, and John Hildreth as secretary.

The past year has been busy one for the Fire Department, there being an increase in the number of fires
and alarms of over thirty per cent. over previous year. We ;
have had fires and alarms, and two of these were of
considerable magnitude—the Browning Hall, and Kellogg
fires, porticularly the Browning hall; and although we had
the chemical, and line of hose at work before the alarm
was rung in, we could make no headway against the fierce
flames of this fire. The building was doomed from the
start, the construction being of such nature that if fire
once got any headway, it was almost sure to be burned
down; and in addition to faulty construction it seems that
the building was soaked with kerosene, it having run
from an upper story into the store where the fire started,
and the flames ran up the kerosene soaked partitions with
great rapidity, and water seemed to have little or no effect

|

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.
on the fire. Of course we knew nothing of the kerosene
matter until after the fire, and we could not understand
why we could not get the fire under control. We feel
that under the circumstances the department did well to
save the adjoining property from any serious loss.
The losses, of which we give detailed statement elseWhere, are briefly as follows: total loss, of this
anount,  has been paid by the insurance companies, leaving net loss of and we think the |
Commissioners and the Department have right to feel }
satisfied with this showing, all the circumstances being
considered. ,
We gladly call attention to the very efficient services
of both officers and men composing the fire department
during the year. The speed and activity shown by the
members of the department is appreciated by the Commissioners, and we believe by our citizens generally. Of
course the department is not perfect, but we are honestly
trying to make it as near so as possible; and while we are
trying to do this we ask the co-operation of every citizen.
We cannot see the members of the department at all times,
and if they are not courteous in their treatment of the
humblest citizen, all we ask is that we be notified, and any
: charge preferred will receive careful investigation; and
while we do not believe in interfering with the private in- |
terests of the men in the department, we believe firemen
should not be engaged in politics; the engine houses must
not be used as headquarters for politicians. The department is maintained for the purpose of putting out fires,
and your Commissioners are determined that it shall exist
for that purpose only. |
We again call attention to the importance of calling
‘out the department as soon as fire is discovered. It  s
better for us to go to several fires where we are not needed,
than be late at fire where we are needed.
Your liberal treatment of the department in the matter
of appropriations we gratefully acknowledge, and we espe- |

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.  
cially thank you for making the appropriations you intended us to have at the beginning of the year, so that we
could know just how much money we had to run the department with, and so could regulate our expenditures

; accordingly. We determined early in the year to economize
wherever possible, so that we might be able to purchase a
new engine out of our regular appropriations, and this we
have done, with your consent, and still have balance of
$ .

The new American engine which we have purchased
will add greatly to our effective force. The old LaFrance
was not reliable, and it was really unsafe to keep it in the
department much longer. :

We have purchased Loeb patent respirator, which
will enable fireman to stand smoke, sulphur and gas for
a very considerable length of time, and we believe it will
be found to be very effective apparatus.

We believe it would be good policy to put chemical
combination hose wagon on the Highlands in place of the
hose wagon now there. Our experience with chemicals  s
very satisfactory very large per cent. of our fires are put
out with the chemical, and the saving from water loss is
very large.

We would also thank the Board of Water Commissioners for their very effective co-operation in putting in
larger mains on Northampton street in the Elmwood district, and in giving us many more hydrants. It is vastly
cheaper to put in plenty of hydrants than to have to use so
much hose, and we hail with satisfaction the prospect of a
large increase in our water supply. |

We have added four permanent men to the department
since our last report. We believe this  good policy; a
small permanent force which can be depended on at any
ininute, either day or night, is better than large call
force, which, no matter how good its members may be,
they cannot get to fire until considerable time has elapsed;
and so we recommend that as fast as possible there shall

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS. |
be appointed, sufficient permanent men to handle the apparatus.
We have held twenty-four regular meetings during |
the year besides many informal ones.
We respectfully ask your careful attention to the :
various recommendations we make under the different ,
sections of our report.
MANUAL FORCE.
The permanent force of the department has been increased by the addition of four men during the past year,
and now consists of the following, to wit: Chief, superinintendent of fire alarm telegraph, two engineets of
Steamers, one stoker, one foreman of Chemical, one engineer of Chemical, one foreman of Hook and Ladder |
No.  one tillerman, fourteen drivers, six permanent |
men.
Total number of permanent force, Lo. |
Call force consists of
, Assistant engineers,  
Engineers of steamers,  
Stokers of,steamers,  
Hose and laddermen,  
Substitutes,  
Total force,   
APPARATUS.
We have recently purchased first-class new American
fire engine, second size, to replace the old rotary La France.
This is an up to date engine, and take it altogether it
seems to be the best made, and it will greatly increase the
efficiency of the department.
We have done considerable repairing on the apparatus, |

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.  
but there still remains considerable to be done in this line.
We must, in the near future, replace engine No. witha
new one, as it is years old and does not give the best
service and, yet costs just as much to run.

| The apparatus now in active service consists of six
steam fire engines, one double tank chemical fire engine,
one combination hose and chemical, seven two-horse hose
‘wagons, one zrial hook and ladder truck, two hook and
ladder trucks, five exercise and supply wagons, one chief’s
buggy, one superintendent of fire alarm wagon and sleigh. HORSES.

We have thirty horses in the department. Most of
them are in good condition, but there is no question but
several of them will have to be replaced this coming year
by younger and stronger horses. The fire department is
no place for poor horses. No matter how good the apparatus is, unless it gets to the fire it is useless. We have
bought six new horses during the past year.

HAY AND FEED.

We are well supplied with hay and bedding, but shall

soon need oats.
HOSE.
We have purchased this year two thousand feet of hose,
and now have in the department hose as follows:

High street house, feet

.
  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS. |

Total number of feet,  
HOUSES. The engine houses are in first-class condition, and
with some small repairs on the inside, and painting on the
outside, will not need to have much done on them the coming year. |
We thank your honorable board, and especially your
honorable city property committee, for the many acts of
consideration and courtesy you have shown us, and also
, for your generous treatment in the matter of repairs. The
work you have done in the various houses have been
thoroughly done by your very efficient superintendent of
public buildings, and we wish to express our appreciation
of his promptness and uniform courtesy. |
We would recommend that the houses (especially Elmwood and Highlands) be fitted with double windows. This
would result in great saving of fuel, and would make the
houses much more comfortable.
We would also recommend that an engine house be
built at the corner of Bh and Sargeant streets, to accommodate steam engine anda chemical engine. The new
high school, costing such large sum, and carrying no
insurance, and the Chestnut street school, Sacred Heart
church and schoois, the German church, and the large
number of fine dwelling houses in this vicinity, together
with the fast growing Oakdale district, all make it imperative that better fire protection be given, and that soon.
We think that for the present we would recommend
that the city put first-class chemical engine at this point,
adding steam fire engine later.
We again draw your attention to the High street house.
This location, never good one for an engine house, grows

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.  
poorer and poorer. The numerous street cars on this, our
main thoroughfare, make it very. dangerous, both to the
general public and to the men driving the apparatus, and
several times accidents have been barely averted. This is
a splendid business location and the house should be sold
and used for business purposes. Good locations for an engine house in the vicinity are growing scarcer, and site
should be bought at once. ,

We again draw your attention to the high school bell,
and ask that it be transferred to House No.  where it will
be of great service. .

FIRE ALARM TELEGRAPH.

This branch of our fire department has been kept fully
up to its previous high standing; the new storage battery
has worked splendidly, besides saving over  per year.

We consider this department of so much importance in
fire fighting, that we have spared no time or labor to make
it perfect. The rapid growth of our city makes it necessary
to constantly extend the service. We have put in six new
boxes during the past year, which are numbered and located as follows:— g, corner East Dwight and West streets;
 at Sargeant and Northampfon streets;  corner Appleton and Dwight streets;  corner Clarke and North, ampton streets; (private) at Watson Ely’s lumber
yard;  (private) at William Skinner Sons. We have
put up six and one-half miles of new wire during the past
year. |
, And we again urge upon the manufacturers of our city
to put into their mills an auxiliary fire alarm, so that no
matter in what room watchman happened to be, the moment he discovered fire he could ring in an alarm without leaving the room, and so could devote himself to putting
out the fire, and might often do so before the department

, got to the scene of the fire; and if the fire should break out

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.

during working hours, the argument for this apparatus is
still stronger. We take the opportunity to thank our citizens for their promptness in ringing in alarms. few
minutes at the beginning of blaze is invaluable.

The service now consists of five circuits and one six
circuit repeater, eighty-nine non-interference fire alarm
boxes, fifty-four owned by the city, and thirty-five by private firms. There is on hand in this department one-half
mile of line wire, three hundred pole brackets, five hundred locust pins, two hundred and fourteen gravity battery jars.

The property in the department is as follows:
Storage Battery, to.

| FIRES AND ALARMS. }

During the past twelve months there have been one
hundred and thirty-eight fires and alarms, fifty-three of
which were rung in from signal boxes, two of which were
false alarms, and seventy-four still alarms, and eleven fires
where no alarm was given. One of the alarms was for the
college fire at South Hadley, where we responded to call
for help.

The total amount of property endangered by fire was

REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.  ,
Loss above insurance, 
Average net loss on fires and alarms, .

One hundred and thirty-seven fires and alarms is an
increase of over thirty per cent. over last year, and if we
take out the Browning Hall lossof about it leaves
only about  loss on the one hundred and thirty-six
fires and alarms. The large loss above instirance was
caused by the small amount of insurance carried by the
owner of Browning Hall. We believe that our citizens are
to be congratulated on the small loss we have. We have
done everything we can*to keep the department up to a
high standard, and we think we have sucded. Of
course we do not think the department is perfect, but that
is what we are aiming for.

We believe our citizens are entitled to lower ratss of
insurance than we get, especially on dwellings. The rates
on this class of risks are higher here than in Springfield,
so we are informed. (Is the reason for this the fact that in
that city they have mutual insurance? If it is, it would
seem to be wise to start one here. )

The careless use of matches, gasolene and kerosene is
the cause of very large number of our fires, and we urge
greater care in the use of these dangerous articles. We
notice that nine fires were caused by electricity. Too
great care cannot be exercised in wiring for this power.

We have been called out of the city twice this year to
help neighbors, and while we do not wish to be selfish and
un-neighborly, yet we feel that our duty is to protect the
lives and property of our own citizens, and only very
great fire should take our men and apparatus out of our
own city. We feel that we have no right to take our firemen to other towns without we pay them extra, and it is
not right to tax our citizens to pay for putting out fires in
other places. Suppose, for instance, large fire had
started in this city while our engine, hose and men were
in Willimansett, should we have been considered negligent?

  REPORT OF FIRE COMMISSIONERS.
We think we should; so we must urge our neighbors to
equip themselves with modern apparatus, and not depend
on us, because we may have to disappoint them.
The causes of the different fires and alarms are classified as follows:

REPORT OF CITY SOLICITOR.
To the Honorable the Mayor and City Council of the City of
flolyoke:
GENTLEMEN: have the honor to submit to you the
City Solicitor’s annual report for ‘he year ending Nov.  ,
 The past year has furnished the City Solicitor’s department with probably more work than any previous year
in the history of the city. The policy of trying easy cases
and postponing hard ones has not been pursued by this
administration. Nearly every case that came up has been
contested though the city in several instances has been
compelled to pay damages on the verdict of the jury. The
city has not been compelled to pay any expenses for senior counsel this year except in Municipal Signal Company |
case where the trial was in Suffolk County. The list of
cases against the city has been considerably decreased this
year especially the old cases which should have been disdisposed of by previous administrations. The following
is the list of cases pending since entered upon the per- |
formance of my duties together with statement of the disposition of each case, viz: .
John J. O’Connor vs. City of Holyoke.

John J. Fitzgibbon served notice on the city on Noveniber that he received injuries owing to defect

about sixty feet easterly from the corner of Race street on
November .

During the past year the legislatufe has passed law
removing the lability of cities and towns for accidents
which happen on the highways caused by ice and snow.
This will releive the city from considerable of litigation to
which it has in the past been subjected, as snow and ice
cases so called, were particularily hard to defend, and  mposed unjust burdens on the cities and towns.

It will be seen from the foregoing report that most of
the litigation  caused by damages on highways. Cities
and towns are obliged to keep their highways in reasonably safe and suitable condition for travel at all seasons of
of the vear and greater diligence should be used in looking
after the sidewalks and streets. would recommend that

| one employee of the Department of Public Works should
be delegated with the duty of repairing the sidewalks, seeing that bricks which have been removed are replaced and
holes are filled up. few dollars expended in repairing
all dangerous places will save the city large expense later.
The most economical way to protect the city from paying
money for damages to persons injured on highways is to
keep the highways in good repair. :

 

REPORT OF CITY SOLICITOR.  
IT also recommend that member of the police force be
delegated to assist the city solicitor in securing evidence.
Unless evidence is secured as soon as notice is received
by the city it is difficult to be obtained when the trial
‘occurs, as the witnesses forget the incident. If one policeman is delegated for such duty it will not take much of
. his time and may save the city many hundreds of dollars.
' The city solicitor should also be compelled to turn
over to his successor in office all evidence and facts which
he has obtained regarding the city cases. It has been very
difficult in the work of the department this year to secure
evidence for cases where the injury occurred two or three
years ago. have appeared before the committee on cities
of the legislatrre, which met in Holyoke, in regard to the
new charter, and before the highway commission in regard
to making the road from Springfield to Holyoke on the
westerly side of the river state road. have also repre- :
sented the board of health in several cases in the police
court. The new water supply for the city, which has been
acted upon by the water commissioners, has also required
attention of the city solicitor. It has been my policy to
attend as far as possible, all the meetings of the board of
aldermen, as believe the city solicitor should receive at
first hand all matters which are referred to him and keep
well acquainted with the policy of the administration.
Although this requires considerable time, believe it to be
beneficial to the interests of the city. have also attended
all the meetings of the committee on claims. have endeavored to hold the parties liable to the city where injuries have occurred through their negligence, and have
given notice to parties whom think should be held responsible for the suits to come into court and defend the
actions. This will result in considerable saving to the
city and make the abuttors more careful. Many opinions
have been called for and cheerfully given to the different
departments. desire to thank Mr. E. A. Kane, city
clerk, and all the departments for their kindly co-opera|

MRS. KATE MOYNIHAN,
Police Matron.
By reference to the first page of this report it will be
| seen that this department consists of four executive officers
and forty patrolmen, an increase of six men this year,
which enables us to give good police protection to all parts
of the city, except perhaps some remote sections which
could only be reached by mounted patrol or bicycle
squad, which, see by reference to reports from other cities,
has been used in the outlaying districts with good results.
In the last annual report of this department it was recommended that the city purchase patrol wagon for its
— use in this department. fail to see how it could be of
a any practical use, as most of the arrests are made after

REPORT OF CITY MARSHAL.  
eleven o'clock at night, and no telephone service is available after ten o’clock P. M., therefore it will be seen at :
once without that great modern invention, the police signal system, patrol wagon would be of little benefit to the
department.

When the police signal system was adopted by several
cities in New England, the people of this city at once rec- ,
ognized its merits and commenced an agitation in its favor,
which finally resulted in the adoption by the city government in of the municipal signal system, but owing to
some supposed illegality in the contract, which was taken
advantage of by the enemies of this particular system to
carry the case before the courts, where it has remained ever
since, to the great detriment of the city’s interest. am
not prepared to say which of the several police signal systems  the best adapted to our wants. All of them have

some merits no doubt, and if, as now seems probable, the
courts will soon dispose of the case now pending, earnestly recommend that you investigate the merits of the
different companies and adopt the latest improved, up-todate system to be obtained regardless of the decision of the
courts in the case now pending. In the event of decision
against the city, which am informed is not anticipated,
the damage can be only nominal.

Detention Room.—Nearly all police departments are
provided witha detenntion room where prisoners arrested for
minor offenses and young boys can be kept, pending the
disposition of their cases. We have one room in the basement of the city hall, which is available for that purpose,
which can be fitted up at comparatively small cost. I
would respectfully recommend that you give it your earnest consideration. |

Pool Tables—It has been the custom of the board to
grant pool table licenses to all applicants regardless of
what business was carried on under it. Many take advantage of their privilege to keep their places open until

  REPORT OF CITY MARSHAL.

long after the saloons close for the purpose of selling
liquor. Their stock of wet goods is usually kept on some
premises other than that covered by their licenses and
brought in.in small quantities which can mostly be carried
on the person of the propaietor, which makes it very difficult to enforce the liquor laws in such pool rooms as
choose to engage in the liquor traffic.

I would respectfully recommend for your consideration that an ordinance regulating the hours of opening

' and closing of pool rooms, with such other rules and regulations as may present themselves to your honorable
board, would be step inthe interest of good government.

Special Police.—It has been the custom of the Board
to appoint all applicants who have applied for positions as
special police, many of them are unfit to perform police
duty, others are constantly employed in different avocations so it is difficult for them to respond to calls for duty
when required by this department; others go about the
city seeking jobs at theatres, dance halls, shows, etc., unbeknown to this department. think the city should not
be held responsible for the acts of any special policemen
not detailed from headquarters, such men as are required
on public parks, night watchman in different mills, blocks,
etc., might safely be appointed. would respectfully recommend the appointment of reserve force, to be taken
from the civil service list. By giving these men what
special work there is we conform to the civil service rules.
It also tends to fit men for positions that they may be called on at any time to fill permanently.

Detective Department.—This branch of the service has
been ably conducted by Detective Cronin, under the direction of Assistant Marshal Haley, they have been untireing
in their efforts to detect criminals and bring them before
the bar of justice; the records show that their efforts have
been crowned with large measure of success. We may

congratulate ourselves that no serious crimes have been

REPORT OF CITY MARSHAL.  
committed within our borders and the entire absence of the
professional element speaks well for the whole department.

The Force..—The efficiency of the force is very commendable; the zeal and fidelity of large majority has
sufficed to keep the average up to other similar departments. note with pleasure that there has been less friction, less politics, and less jealousy among the men than
formerly. .

Conclusion.—I desire to express my obligations to
Mayor Curran, and the committee on police, also Judge
Pearsons and Clerk Tierney of the Police court, for their
kindly advice and the many acts of courtesy extended to
me. also wish to express my full appreciation of the able
and faithful assistance rendered by Assistant Marshal
Haley, Captain Herbert, Lieutenant Peters, and Detective
Cronin, who one and all have endeavored to maintain the
confidence conferred upon them by the municipal administration of  .

Respectfully submitted,
S. T. MILLER,
Marshal.

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
To His FHlonor, the Mayor, and Gentlemen of the City Council:

GENTLEMEN:—Herewith is presented the report of the
board of health of the city of Holyoke for the year ending
November As required by law, the board met
for organization the first Monday in February. Dr. G. H.
Smith was chosen chairman, Joseph Murray was elected
clerk, Richard Shea, health officer, and Dr. John F. Buckley, secretary of the board of health.

The regular meetings of the board have been held on
the first Wednesday after the first Saturday of each month.
The board found it necessary to hold number of special ]
meetings to give hearings upon petitions and to transact
other business pertaining to the office.

A number of visits of inspection were made by the
whole board. In addition to these, the members of the
board individually made very many inspection visits.

The board is pleased to state thateduring the past year
the health of the city has been exceptionally good. The
mortality has been lower and contagious diseases fewer
than the previous year. We have, however, fair amount
of diphtheria, scarlet fever, typhoid fever and measles, but
at no time did those threaten to become epidemic.

About November first, the city was somewhat startled
by discovering one case of small pox at No. Fountain
street. The origin of this solitary case continues to be
shroudedin mystery. We are of theopinion, however, that
it must have been carried from paper mill in which sisREPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
ter of this boy is employed. The youngster had, few
months previously, been vaccinated, which circumstance
considerably modified the virulence of the attack. The
vicinity of this outbreak is one of the most densely populated in the city, and had it not been promptly handled by
the board of health and school officers, the condition which
we would most naturally expect would have assumed
alarming proportions. As several weeks have now elapsed
since quarantine was taken off, we believe we have seen
the last of the pest.

The collecting of house offal still continues to be done
by contract. Last year, the board received several bids
ranging from  to  per month. This contract as

 during the previous year was awarded to Patrick Shea and
M. F. Driscoll, each receiving  per month, and each
to furnish bond of  for the faithful performance of
this work, and each to furnish driver and covered cart.
This work on the whole has been done as satisfactory as
price paid would allow. Very few complaints being heard.

In collecting swill, the contractors have been .occasioned considerable annoyance by parties collecting for
themselves. These parties find out where the best swill is
deposited, select what they want and scatter the remainder
about the alley. ,

The contractors, whose work it is to remove all such
stuff on his rounds, very naturally concludes there must
be some kind of an agreement between house holder and
those private collectors, and very naturally passes by those
places. We think some little vigilance on the part of
police officers would put stop tothiscustom. While this
practice is tolerated, it is next to impossible to keep the
alleys in any kind of sanitary condition.

The city council, judging by the size of appropriation
each vear, seems to forget the fact that this city is taking
upon itself new localities each year, an appropriation which

. five or six years ago would be more than ample, is no more
than half sufficient for our present needs. The residents

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.

of new districts are now demanding priveleges accorded to
residents in more central localities. Those people are taxpayers and in all justice, should have priveleges in common withthe rest. The board of health is pleased to state
that our health officer, Mr. Richard Shea, has spared
neither time nor energy to place the alleys in clean and
most sanitary condition.

The alleys have never before been put in more presentable condition. If the residents could understand the
vital importance of health boards in our cities, and could
intelligently comprehend the fact that on the sanitary condition of our alleys depends to considerable extent the
health or mortality of their families, we are firmly convinced they would see the utility of unlimiting the appropriation for this department.

About the close of the past year very important step
was taken by paving the alley between Appleton and Suffolk north of High. ‘This alley was one of the worst in
the city. certain sum each year should be appropriated
for the paving of portion of alley. In this way the time
would not be far remote when our alleys would all be
paved and in good sanitary condition.

The disposal of alley garbage is now very serious
question. ‘There is positively no sure or proper place in
the city nor within the near surroundings of the same
where garbage and other refuse matter can be deposited.
It therefore becomes extremely necessary that measures be
taken to adopt some method of disposal and get it in condition as soon as possible. We would recommend that
your honorable body make at once an appropriation for
the putting up of crematory plant and make an offer for
bids to construct the same.

For years it has been the custom to dump garbage collected upon grounds owned by private individuals. While
this matter of disposal is of good advantage to owners of
hollow and marsh lands, persons residing in or about the vicinity where this refuse is dumped and where in hot seaREPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
sons it is allowed to decompose and send out the foulest of
odors, object inthe strongest terms. In reference to the
disposal of ashes and alley refuse, we respecfully submit |
that it is neither wise policy nor economical to make
valuable land for private individuals without receiving
any recompense, though for years, because of the fact that
the city has had no land on which this ashes and refuse
could be dumped, the board has been obliged to fill land
belonging to private individuals without receiving any
compensation therefore in order to dispose of this stuff. If
after investigation it should be the wisdom of the council
that acrematory should be erected for the disposal of
garbage it will be absolutely necessary for the city to
acquire land for the erection of buildings necessary for that
purpose.

In disposing of house garbage the board, as before
suggesting, is of the opinion that steps must be taken immediately to dispose of the same. It will take some time
to look this matter up and get plant in operation, no
matter how systematically we may prod in the matter.
The time to do all this work is not when we are shut off
from the present dump and have no method of disposal at
hand. As the work of putting up crematory apparatus
would entail an expense which the board of health has no

. legal authority to contract, and as it is problem which
requires the most careful consideration and the best
thought, the board respectfully recommends that committee be appointed from the city council to act in conjunction with the board of health, with authority to investigate
the several systems of disposing of house garbage by visiting some of the plants now in operation, and after such
investigation to make such recommendations in the premises as may seem to the committee and this board for the
best interests of the residents of this city. The board is
now happy in the consciousness that this is very favorable year for the carrying out of this project. No one in
the city realizes more fully the necessity for carrying out

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.

this plan than our mayor-elect. His experience for years
as member of the board of health has frequently and
most forcibly demonstrated this necessity. We hope this
will be one of the first items to claim his honorable attention. The force employed on the alleys at present consists
of six double teams and seventeen men. The price paid
each double team is  per day. This force, in order to
do justice to the increasing demands, should be considerably increased. This move, however, the board is unable
to carry out on account of the smallness of the appropriation. |

During the year an inspection of the whole city by
every member of the board was made on several occasions.
On these occasions number of localities of doubtful sanitary conditions were promptly corrected and in manner
acceptable to the board. The importance of these sanitary

 inspections, regularly and systematically carried out in the
early season of each year, can not be over estimated. They
stimulate the habitually careless to better regulation of

. their homes and remove from unsanitary localities much
that invites and fosters disease. .

In consequence of business depression and inability of
tenants to pay rent, in large number of cases, the board,
in many instances found it regular hardship to property
holders to improve property. In great number of instances too, the property was of such poor character that
really it seemed like insulting new closets by compelling

 them to be placed in such tumble down places.

, Experience, however, has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the board that those very places are the life and
substance of disease bearing germs, and to allow them,
though sympathy for the landlord to go by default, would
be an injustice to ourselves and the community at large.
In few instances, persons not complying with the board’s
orders in regard to abaiting nuisances were served with
sheriff's orders and conviction and fine resulted in number of cases.

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH. ;

The board of health, we believe, on former occasions,
called the attention of your honorable body to the extremely
unsanitary condition of the water closets, cells, tramp room
and especially that barbarous instrument of torture known
as the padded cell situated in the basement of the city hall,
but as yet no action has been taken to remedy this evil.

Several diseases occuring among the officers, whose
business makes it imperative they should remain in this
unsanitary den have been traced directly to this cause.
This ‘‘ padded cell’’ is one of the worst and most unsanitary dens in the city. If had an animal had any great
regard for, wouldn’t endanger its life by compelling it to
spend night inthis, place; practically no ventilation, cut
off from the light, damp and musty, the foulest of odors
assail the nostrils after person has been confined in this
place for few hours. It is disgrace to any civilized
community and should at once receive attention.

It is the opinion of those people who know generally
what they are talking about, that no office should be
allowed in this basement. ‘There are five or six cells also
in this basement that have never seen the light, neither is
there breath of fresh air wafted intothis hole. ‘This condition of affairs should not be allowed to exist. Prisoners
should be placed in sanitary quarters.

We have not the means at our command, nor is it
within the province of this board to make alterations in
public property of the city. We would not, however, be |
doing our duty if we remained silent while matters in this,
basement continue to go on in this present condition.

Great care should be exercised in regards to reporting
suspicious cases in our schools. Inquiry should be made
by the teachers each day relative to throat troubles and
contagious diseases. If any be reported, such cases should
be prevented from attending school, and the board of
health immediately notified. When the suspected case is
visited and if found contagious, the patient should be de- |

  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.
| tained and isolated. In this manner much sickness can be
prevented. |

It is of special necessity on the part of the public
health that each physician engaged in the care of contageous and infectious diseases should report them at the
earliest date of diagnosis to the secretary of the board of
health. Valuable aid can thereby be rendered in protecting the families of that locality and arresting further development or spread of the disease. The physician in
attendance, it is true, can, and probably in the majority of
instances does act conscientiously in this matter. There
are on the other hand, and this board is perfectly cognizant
of the fact, few physicians who entirely ignore every rule
governing the board of health. few doses are now in
waiting for these beligerents and the board this coming
year will see that it be administered.

We have now had three years of the plumbing ordinance and every citizen  loud in praise of the same. Each
sucding year but demonstrates more forcibly the advantages of this office, and the wonder is, ‘‘How did we
get along so many years without it?’ During the past
year the work done by the inspector has by actual count
increased four fold. The city is particularly fortunate in
having so efficient man as Mr. Joseph Murray to conduct
this work. |

So far as we are able to perceive Mr. Murray has done

his work faithfully, treating all alike, showing favor to
none. The improvements which recently have been made on
the almshouse make that institution one of the best in the
state.

A grave error we believe has been committed in not
furnishing the entire plant. number of cases belonging
to this city that are being cared for by other towns might
be taken care of at our own almshouse at about half the
present expense. |

The upper floor of one of the wings might be finished

REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.  
off for hospital purposes with great saving to the city.
The services of trained nurse and couple of competent
assistants might be secured and all the milder cases of city
charge attended to at minimuin of expense. In bringing
this matter before your honorable attention we do so not
for lack of cause. few.instances. where women about to
become mothers could not be attended to at the almshouse
for.want of proper accommodations. These women have
had to be removed to private families in the city and remain
until well. The ventilation especially on the first floor
seems to be imperfect. This should be thoroughly looked
after and placed in best sanitary condition.

Among the several officers in this city, there exists one
for the inspection of milk. This office so far as is of any 
practical results, exists but in name. Year after vear this
matter has been taken up, thoroughly gone over by each
succeding board of health, and each year the same action
has been taken. In the estimation of the board of health,
  Office in the city is more important and capable of doing
more good and that at very small expense. The inspec- tor. cannot, with present appropriation, be expected to do
anything like justice with this office. The appropriation |
is not sufficient to procure one tenth part of the equipment
necessary to conduct successful analysis. To our minds,
there is no department tn the city during the months of

' July, -August: and September. deserving of more careful
attention. If-we but-reflect upon the hundreds of helpless
little infants whose very lives:depend upon the purity of
cow’s milk, we can at once see the justice of this board’s
rematks concerning.this:matter. .. |. |
-- .:The reason:of the greatly increased mortality among
infants dnring the hot months is chiefly because cows’ milk
is apt to be contaminated with germs of, tuberculosis,
cholera infantum, and many other diseases that without
much warning carry these infants off. We therefore most
respectfully call your attention to this condition and ask
you to increase the appropriation. consistent with work, ex  REPORT OF BOARD OF HEALTH.

pected. Especially do we request you to have thorough

, examination made during the very hot months. We read
a great deal and hear considerable concerning tuberculosis
in cows. The state cattle commissioners have received a
large appropriation for the examination of herds and extermination of this dread disease. certain proportion of
this appropriation comes to Holyoke. We suggest that a
competent person be appointed to this office. It is an important position and should have person whom previous
experience and knowledge of disease in cattle have fitted
him to do the work thoroughly, scientifically and conscientiously. Somevery decided action should ‘be taken in
regard to sale and consumption of ice during the summer
months. We are aware that ice is vehicle for all kinds
of germs. practice very common among us is to place
ice in water, allow it to melt and drink the water. This,
when we reflect, seems to be very dangerous habit. One
place in particular, where ice is harvested and sold from
house to house should be condemned and owner prosecuted. When cold weather begins this person dams up a
small stream which runs by his door. On either side of
this brook are watersheds which contain decomposing
animal and vegetable matter, the rains meet this manure
and work it into the stream and large percentage of the
ice you drink is composed of this material We are particularly blessed in having good ice; in fact as good as can
be procured in any city. The case mentioned above is the
only one we are aware of that is not all right.

REPORT OF THE CITY PHYSICIAN.

lo His Honor, the Mayor, and gentlemen of the City Council:

In discharging the duties of this office of city physician for have made at the police station, almshouse,
House of Providence and City Hospital and outside poor
about calls; have vaccinated children for the different schools, and signed about vaccination certificates.
No epidemic has appeared this year, but on the whole have
had plenty of work in this department. In addition to the |
above work have examined twelve applicants for the police force under civil service law and filled the necessary
papers. Have filled out burial permits for undertakers
for deaths occurring in the city, and about twenty permits
for disinterment and reburial. great deal of unnecessary
annoyance is caused the city physician in re-signing vaccination cerrificates. When child receives certificate
of vaccination this certificate should suffice.  record
should be kept by some department of education and not
make much trouble for the secretary of the board of health.
The child’s arm has to be examined and new certificate
given each time the pupil happens to change from one
school to another. It is-absolutely necessary that each
physician, as soon as he is satisfied he has diagnosed a
contageous disease, or disease dangerous to the public
health, make report to the secretary of the board of
health. For this purpose the secretary of the board has on
hand supply of postal cards which may be had at any
time.

JOHN F. BUCKLEY, M. D.
City Physician.

REPORT OF THE INSPECTOR OF
PLUMBING.
Gentlemen of the Board of Health:

As inspector of plumbing have the honor to submit
to you my third annual report for the year ending November .

The tables which follow show to what extent and nature the work that has been done.

The number of houses already connected with the
public sewer and in which additional work and fixtures

* were placed, and also where privy vaults were ordered removed and water closets put in, were  .

These figures alone show that the work of inspection
is increasing, and the very few cases where defective work
was found by your inspector speaks well for our plumbers.
Number of plumbing permits granted,  

‘‘ “water closets put in new buildings,  

“é ‘* bath tubs 

‘“ “* wash bowls  

‘‘  “* wash trays  

‘e  ** sinks  

“urinals IO

‘f “traps  

‘‘ “water closets put in old buildings,

  REPORT OF INSPECTOR OF PLUMBING.
Number of wash trays put in old buildings,  

"urinals (ees  

‘"  ** traps of all kinds put in old buildings,  

‘‘ —“ privy vaults ord’d r’m’v’d fr’m premises,  

‘‘ yards ordered cleaned,  

‘* ** tenements ordered cleaned,  

‘*  ** barn cellars ordered cleaned, ..  
Investigations and inspections made,  
Sinks found not properly trapped,  
Insufficient supply of water to water closet,  
Houses inspected containing contagious diseases,  
Houses with defective sewerage,  
Houses with defective plumbing,  
Legal notices served to abate nuisances,  

Each of these cases has complied with the requirements of the board. Many nuisances have been abated on
verbal notice from the inspector without action by the
board and of which no records have been made.

The plumbing ordinances have been complied with as
a general rule by both the master and journeymen plumbers—as they can very well see that the value of ‘‘sanitary
plumbing’’ to the health of city cannot be over estimated,
and am of the opinion of that, which has often been expressed by high authorities, that the time is not far distant
when none but experts will be allowed to do plumbing
work.

The board of health has had several complaints made
to it of the filthy and unclean condition of the several iron
tanks used for watering horses. ‘Therefore recommend
that frequent inspection and thorough cleansing of these
tanks be made, as the importance of such inspection and
cleansing must be apparent to any person giving this subject moment’s thought, as think it comes within the
board’s jurisdiction to have care of such matters.

One of the most important rules of this board is that
which calls for final examination of work completed by
the plumbers, but which is not fully complied with on acREPORT OF INSPECTOR OF PLUMBING.  
count of the neglect of the plumbers to notify the plumbing
inspector upon the completion of all work done by them.

It is my wish that all property owners will in the
future require their plumbers to give them the certificate
of inspection furnished from this office. Such certificate is
given to every plumber on the completion and final exam- .
ination of his work, which is to be given to the owner or
agent of the property when the plumbing work has been
done.

Thanking you for the confidence in the past and hoping may merit the same in the future, remain,

: JOSEPH A. MURRAY,

Inspector of Plumbing.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT OF
STREETS.
To the Honorable, the Mayor and the City Council of Holyoke.

I have the honor to lay before you the report of the
superintendent of streets for the year ending December rst,
 covering the twelve months of my service from December Ist,  The total expenditures in the department of highways and bridges were the largest
one item in this department being the cleaning of the streets,
which amounted to  and for the repairing of streets
and highways .has been expended. ‘There was
placed on the streets loads of gravel, which the city
had to pay for, loads at cents load, amounting to
$ It is yearly becoming more difficult to obtain
good gravel and the increasing distance of cartage makes
it more expensive as road hardening material. In view
of this difficulty and the increasing expense, think it will
be economy to annually macadamize or pave such portions
of our mainly traveled streets as our means will allow. I
recommend the following streets to be macadamized the
coming year:

Lyman street from Maple to Pine streets.

Hampden street from Elm to Pine streets. |

Dwight streets from Elm to Linden streets.

Lyman street from Canal to Summer streets. .

I will recommend the following streets to be paved
with vitrified brick: |

  REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT OF STREETS.

Maple street from Dwight to Hampden streets.

Cabot street from Race to Canal streets, with vitrified
brick or granite blocks.

I also recommend two new bridges, one on Main street
across the third level canal, and one on Bridge street near
the mill of the Valley Paper company. ‘These bridges
ought to be built either with iron or of stone with arches.
Some of the bridges are also in need of repairing. There
were four bridges replanked this year at cost of .

The total expenditure in the sidewalk department was
$ recommend that during the coming year a

MILK, VINEGAR AND
OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR, Hampden St., \
HOLYOKE, MASS.,  .
To the Honorable Mayor and Board of Aldermen :

I have the honor to submit herewith the following report as inspector of milk, vinegar and petroleum, for the
city of Holyoke, for the year  .

F Making the total number of quarts sold yearly  which at the retail value of the milk sold in the city
every year is Ht :

 REPORT OF INSPECTOR OF MILK, ETC. ,

The samples of milk that have tested have as rule
been very good. ‘The exceptions were two samples that
were very poor, and several samples that were dirty and
evidently came from stables that were not properly kept.

By chemical analysis it cannot be determined whether
milk is fit for food or not; of course the smell, taste, and
looks of the milk determine that in some respects, but the
milk may have disease germs and still to all appearances
and chemical test be good milk. Epidemics of typhoid
fever and cholera infantum have been caused by impure

. milk, rendered so either by improper feeding of cows, impure water given them, or from the filthiness of their
quarters and attendance. Of course the adulteration of
milk by the addition of water is fraud upon the public
and should be stopped. think the inspector should visit
every stable possible that is within his jurisdiction from
which milk comes, and not to do this once year, but at
frequent intervals. think this the most important part
of the inspector’s duty. To do this an inspector should be
paid salary that will remunerate him; this cannot be
done on the salary that receive, as the inspector’s duties
should demand his entire time.

I would respectfully suggest that the Inspector be
paid salary sufficient that he may devote his entire time
to his duties, and also that asuitable laboratory, apparatus, etc., be furnished him as in other cities. It seems to
me rather absurd that the officer and chemist, looking
after the most important and easily adulterated article of
food and liable to carry disease, should be paid the small 
salary of  in city like Holyoke with nearly inhabitants and where the value of the article sold amounts
to more than  annually. The fees collected by the .
inspector for licenses amount to more than one-half his
salary, which shows that the present salary of the inspector is scarcely sufficient to cover the cost of the clerical
work, not to speak of time spent as inspector. would
suggest that  be approprioted for this department
that it may be worthy of its name.

REPORT OF INSPECTOR OF MILK, ETC.  
VINEGAR.

As to the inspection of vinegar, have done very little
with it this year, but it is very important article of food
and should be attended to. The vinegar in general use is,
without doubt, very much adulterated, and there is a
great deal of vinegar sold that does not come up to the
standard. The reason for my not attending to this more
strictly has been lack of funds.

OLEOMARGARINE.

The sale of oleomargarine has practically been driven
from the city, as the state officers have been very active to
see that it has been sold within law, and there is now no
license to sell in force in the city, and if any is used here it
comes from other places.

PETROLEUM.

The number of barrels inspected this year was  ,
of fifty gallons.

(A large proportion of the kerosene oil that comes to
this city comes in tank cars, so take gallons as meaning barrel.)

Owing to strong competition the price of oil has been
very low, and as natural consequence the quality of the
oil has not been as high. Some of the dealers have been
trying to see how light test oil they could sell and not sell
illegal oil. Some people think that Iam responsible for
the poor oil sold, but cannot prod against any of them
as long as they keep within the law.

Respectfully,
| JAMES K. MORRILL,
Inspector.

REPORT OF OVERSEERS OF THE
POOR. |
To the Honorable, the Mayor, and the City Council of Holyoke:

Pursuant to the requirements of the city ordinances,
the overseers of the poor herewith submit their twenty-second annual report for the fiscal year of  .

The demands on this board for temporary aid during
the year just ended have been greater than for any year in
the history of the city. Many strong and able-bodied men
and women, able and willing to work, have for the first
time applied for aid, forced to do so because of their inability to procure employment to support themselves and families. Such demands must be met with due regard, for both
the interests of the recipients and welfare of the city.

During the year there has been issued to able-bodied
men who applied for aid, to save their families from hunger,
  working cards, three days each, making days,
working nine hours day» These men have been em' ployed in various ways about the almshouse and farm,‘but
mostly in cutting wood to be distributed to poor families in
the city calling for aid. The plan of. buying wood in the
lot and having it cut by the able-bodied men calling for
assistance, has proved to be source of great saving tothe
department in the item of fuel. Early in the year the
board purchased wood lot at cost of There has
been delivered out of that to the poor of the city about  
cords, there are now at the almshouse cords, and there

  REPORT OF OVERSEERS OF THE POOR.

still remains about one half of the lot with about  railroad ties. There has also been sold wood to the amount
amount of The total amount expended by the
board for the year for partial or whole support is ,
divided as follows :

City out-door poor, 
Insane, outside almshouse,  
State,  
Other cities and towns,  
Almshouse,  
Making total of, 

This includes the running expenses of the department,
salaries, (not including almoner’s) office supplies, and
other necessary incidentals.

The increase of expenses this year over that of is
$ due in part to natural increase of population, but
mostly on account of the scarcity of work, which has continued during the whole year.

The cost of insane at state institutions was ;
sick at hospitals, These are very large items of
expense, which we hope to reduce when the almshouse
building is completed. Out of the total expense the city
will in due time be reimbursed to the amount of 
from the state, for aid rendered to persons having no settlement in the state, and  from other cities and towns
for aid rendered persons having a‘settlement elsewhere in
the .state. City physician’s visits charged to state and
other cities and towns amounted to Reimbursement for care of insane receipts from other sources,
$ Total credit, This will leave the net
expense, .

REPORT OF OVERSEERS OF THE POOR.  
ALMSHOUSE. .

During the year there have been two ells added to the
old building, which will contain rooms; the new part is
not as yet completed, but should be as soon as possible.
The completion of the new building will give to the city
one of the finest almshouse buildings in the State, having
in all  rooms. 

The old building is in need of repair, the walls should
be painted, also the outside wood-work, if this was done
the building would be in good condition for several years.
The grounds about the place are in bad shape and should

' be properly graded. There is also great need of proper
fence about the institution. |

The total cost of the institution for the year was
$ Receipts for board, from farm produce
and sale of pigs, sale ot wood, net cost
for year .

Number of inmates Dec. 
Number admitted during the year,  
Whole number during the year,  
Number of inmates discharged,  
Number of inmates died,  
Number remaining Nov.  
The average number of inmates during the year,  
The average cost per week for each inmate was, 

There was during the year furnished to men employed
about the place dinners at cents per dinner which
amounted to this amount should go to the credit
of the almshouse. :

In conclusion the board would respectfully call your
attention to the fact, that the office occupied by the almoner
in the basement of the city hall building is now to small to
properly transact the business of the department. It is
also very damp and not suitable place for public office.

  REPORT OF OVERSEERS OF THE POOR.
We therefore urgently request that more suitable quarters
be furnished as soon as possible.
Following is the report in detail, all of which is respectfully submitted.
