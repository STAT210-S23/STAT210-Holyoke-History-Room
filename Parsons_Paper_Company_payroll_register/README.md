The first column 'last_full' records the employee's last name followed by their first name. The columns 'lastname' and firstname' record an individual's last and first names respectively. 'First_worked' is the date corresponding to the first payroll an individual's name appeared on. 'Last_worked' is the last payroll the individual appeared on. 'Years_worked' is the total number of time an individual worked for according to our transcriptions. Finally, 'no_longer_working' records if the individual was recorded as working on the last payroll period of 1869-01-01.
