The Riverview Renewal Area was a part of Holyoke that underwent demolition and reconstruction as part of a 1960s urban renewal project. The area was bounded by Lyman Street to the West, Pulaski Park to the East, Front Street to the South, and Pine Street to the North.

A spreadsheet has been created with information about the properties, address, owner, and assessed values (see https://github.com/STAT210-S23/STAT210-Holyoke-History-Room/blob/main/Riverview_Renewal_Project/riverview_renewal_data_2023_05_08.xlsx).

The properties in the area are grouped into blocks and parcels.
Any given block has several properties (parcels) associated with it.
The `riverview_organized` folder  contains image files that provide information about parcels in blocks 1-16 of the neighborhood.

The naming of the images are done using the following protocol:

Parcel information sheets - `block_x_parcel_y_info.png` 
These sheets include information about the property's location, owners, valuation, tax assessments, among others.
The information provided varies across properties.
Some parcels are associated with more than one information sheet.
For these parcels there are numbers at the end of the filename denoting the order of the information sheets.


Maps - `block_x_parcel_y_map_z.png`
These images shows where the parcels are located on the map. Some parcels have more
than one map image.


Photos - `block_x_parcel_y_photo_z.png`
These images show photographs of the parcels.
Some parcels have more than one photograph.
