This folder houses materials related to the creation of the reverse directory of the 1885 Holyoke Directory. 

`reverse_directory.csv` is currently a draft output of the addresses of individuals after parsing through the online text.

The scanned `PDF` was too big to upload on GitHub, but it can be found here at https://archive.org/details/holyokemassachus00pric, for both the scanned `PDF` and `txt` versions.
