This folder houses materials related to the creation of the reverse directory of the 1885 Holyoke Directory. 

https://github.com/STAT210-S23/STAT210-Holyoke-History-Room/blob/main/Reverse_Directory/business_full_data_output.csv contains the spreadsheet with the addresses of individuals after parsing through the online text.

The scanned `PDF` was too big to upload on GitHub, but it can be found here at https://archive.org/details/holyokemassachus00pric, for both the scanned `PDF` and `txt` versions. 

Here is a link to the report describing the process: https://github.com/STAT210-S23/STAT210-Holyoke-History-Room/blob/main/Reverse_Directory/report.pdf
