# STAT210-Holyoke-History-Room
Repository for materials curated by students in STAT210 (Mining the History of Holyoke) based on materials from the Holyoke Public Library History Room

We express our profound appreciation to Eileen Crosby for her efforts to support the class and this initiative.
We remain greatly impressed by how her work on behalf of the archives helps document and bring to life the rich history of Holyoke, Massachusetts.
