# STAT210-Holyoke-History-Room
Repository for materials curated by students in STAT210 (Mining the History of Holyoke) based on materials from the Holyoke Public Library History Room

We express our profound appreciation to Eileen Crosby for her efforts to support the class and this initiative.
We remain greatly impressed by how her work on behalf of the archives helps document and bring to life the rich history of Holyoke, Massachusetts.

Professor Frank Couvares contributed his time to assist the class in better understanding the history of Holyoke.
We also want to thank Zoe Jacobs for her assistance with course planning and logistics and Tim Pinault for technical support with the scanning.
Funding support for the course was provided by the Amherst College Provost's office in addition to support from the Feldman fund.
